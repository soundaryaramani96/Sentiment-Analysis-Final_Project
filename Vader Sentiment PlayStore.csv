3,4,Spotify,Michele LaBlanc,4,12,Overall great app. Love that I can have multiple playlists. Very few songs I've searched for have been unavailable. Only complaint: after the last update I can no longer scroll the song screen to share the song on FB or in text. Every time I try to scroll Spotify crashes. I miss that feature. Please fix. =),Positive
4,5,Spotify,Makara Bedell,5,7,"it's good and all, but ur recent update is trash. Bc usually I'll put my playlist on shuffle and if I dont feel like listening to that song I'll just play a different one but now I can't do that.",Positive

9,10,Spotify,Jordan Mitchell,1,2,why cant all my saved music be automatically grouped together in one playist so i can just shuffle all of my music when i want to? if i want all my music in one playist i have to like each individual song which is really inconvenient considering all the music i listen to is around 10000 songs and im not about to go through every single song and like them so i can have them in one playist together to be able to just shuffle all of my music. step back from previous UI in my opinion.,Positive
639,640,Spotify,_Dewey,3,0,"I love spotify, its got almost ever song you can think of, the price is great, but man the android app keeps getting worse and worse with new bugs to it. The latest one has made it nearly impossible to use, evertime i go to open it, it has to log me in, with smart lock for some reason, then will work for about 5 seconds before it freezes and loads again. The only way I can get it to not crash is by turning offline mode on before it freezes. Otherwise in offline mode it works fine.",Positive

I had thought I found a fix by turning on the Dolby Atmos feature in the equalizer in Spotify. That seems to keep the volume at one level when it stays on. The Dolby Atmos feature turns itself off on it's own from time to time and the volume jumps to full volume again. Right now, I can't get the Dolby Atmos to turn back on so my volume keeps jumping to full blast. ugh!",Positive

87,88,Spotify,A Google user,3,2,New update is garbage this used to be a 5 star app. Now I give it 3. I got excited for the new UI and see new things but you took away the ability shuffle all the music I have save. I can no longer store my music. My library is gone. And my daily play lists are now all over the place with genres. I never used Amazon music or Google music becuse I didn't like the ui. But I'm about to switch if this dosnt get resolved. Ps. My music stops when my screen is locked. I am a extreamly dissatisfied cust,Positive
37,38,Spotify,Shinnosuke Delacruz,5,34,"Loved it, it's a much modern and unique UI and still packs all the music that I love. It's a smooth experience and I'm loving every second of it. For those who are having issues with your playlist--not playing any songs after listening to all the songs (songs not included in the playlist itself) Go to your settings then enable auto-play. If there's a big change to an app, check the settings if there's something that the developers changed or ""improved."" Just take a look and check everything.",Positive
38,39,Spotify,maverick mamaghani,2,1,"disclaimer: 2-star rating is for Android. I rate Spotify experience on iPhone at 4.5 stars. Here's why: â€¢ Left Swipe option to Queue, only works on iOS â€¢â€¢ Earphone Triple Click to rewind or go to the previous track, right? No. only available on iOS version. Why make such a basic feature exclusive to iPhone? Spotify Premium worth it if you own an iPhone, but if you own a Pixel or a Galaxy you might wanna consider saving your buck$$ YouTube Music.",Positive
224,225,Spotify,A Google user,3,0,Why would you take out raidio based on playlist? I used to get new music recommendations based on my taste. featured music on Spotify is so not my taste. Pandora is somehow better at finding new songs i like then add them to my playlist on Spotify.,Positive
40,41,Spotify,Rokas Krivaitis,4,24,"Awesome app and service, especially with the student discount and recent redesign. But there are things that I would change. I can't seem to find the entire song list in the artist page. Also the theming between live and static album covers is quite different. A single consistent theme would look more pleasing in my opinion. Other than that the sound quality is great and the multiple platform support is phenomenal. Keep up the good work.",Positive
41,42,Spotify,Garv Banerji,5,0,"I love how the app generally works. The quality of music streaming using this service is amazing. The integration with my Android phone and Waze is amazing. The user interface is simple and easy to use, which is a pro for me. Apple Music didn't make anything easy to get with my old iPhone. Over all the integration, convenience, and quality all check of as a 10/10. I haven't experienced any bugs with the app at all. I can even download music so I can listen to my music peacefully.",Positive
42,43,Spotify,Clement Trotman,1,4,"Eq Sucks!!! It dampers sound, doesn't expand or enhance it. Many tunes are missing and that you would expect to be found. The ads: claim they will provide you 30 mins of free listen. Which is a ""LIE""!! Also they freeze your device, from time to time. Where your going too, have to reset your device. Now the hands-free wont connect via Bluetooth, to the car kenwood deck. cant use remote or deck commands, to NO LONG operate!!!",Negative
43,44,Spotify,josh rathbun,2,3,This app is slowly going downhill. Every update changes the way songs are alphabetized and it's slowly becoming less user friendly. Why can't I search by my downloaded artist anymore? Why when I select a song from my library does the shuffle turn off? I miss the spotify I had a year ago when it was easy to use and didn't change every month,Positive
44,45,Spotify,Nandhu Krishnan,2,0,"finally after releasing in India, loved the app except the fact that I can't play a song which is in my language. I could accept if that was for a song from other countries but what about the one from my own? does buying premium membership set that off?? Is that why its like not playable? I'd rather stick to SoundCloud or Saavn! thanks( only reason losing 3 stars is this. Not much use when a music app cannot play music ðŸ¤·ðŸ»â€â™‚)",Positive
45,46,Spotify,Chawakorn Chaichanawirote,1,1,"this used to be the best paid music streaming service for me, now Spotify Premium is indistinguishable from the free version. They removed the all songs option which I used quite often. Now in offline mode I can't see any playlist or albums since I haven't downloaded complete albums or playlists yet, even though I have 16 gb of music on my device. Why would you remove features like this? I'm going back to apple music if this doesn't change.",Positive
46,47,Spotify,FREDDY ROCK,1,1,"you know it would be a good music app, but when you go to search half the time even with a good internet connection it takes 15 to 30 seconds to even load anything. it's 2019 and this thing acts like it just got released and 1998. fix your app.just because you're becoming a big name brand like Netflix and Hulu doesn't mean you have to make your customers suffer now due to your lazy techs. this is not worth $10 a month.",Positive
264,265,Spotify,A Google user,3,1,"Spotify is an awesome service. The app works fine in general but crashes very often when I'm downloading big playlists for offline usage. It goes back to the home screen and I have to restart the app to continue downloading. Please look into this issue as I have lots of storage on my phone that I would like to fill with lots of offline music. Due to this issue I'm giving this app 3 stars, if Spotify fixes the continuous crashing then I will gladly give this app 5 stars.",Positive
48,49,Spotify,ronyoshii,1,33,"Pretty good selection of music. Even some pretty niche videogame and chip tune music. Even still, the algorithm will more often recommend under tale. Gotta chill that. (edit: new update took away the ability to store music etc on sd card. would give more stars if features weren't taken away.) (edit 2: now i no longer have the ability to use a sleep timer which is howi fall asleep to podcasts without it playing indefinitely. why are features bring removed instead of improved?)",Positive
49,50,Spotify,Jean Rivera,2,8,"Why did you removed the filter bar from the top of the playlists? It was so easy to quickly filter my huge list of songs. The added step is completely unnecessary as it worked perfectly before, please change it back. Also, im not sure how i feel about the song menu taking the entire screen. You guys can can do a better job with it.",Positive
50,51,Spotify,Nate Zittnan,5,25,"Great UI, all the music you could ever want, and they reccomend music that you might like through the Discover Weekly playlist. By the way, this is not a paid review, I just love this app. If you don't have it, get it. Hulu is also included with Spotify Premium, which is great and adds even more value to the $10 monthly subscription.",Positive
51,52,Spotify,Ashe Odinson,4,9,"Right out the gate, I was impressed with the intuitive system for adding liked artists. I don't know how many showed up after picking a similar artist, making me repeatedly say ""I forgot about that band!"" I've rediscovered plenty of old favorites this way. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is the shortness of the playlists. I was a loyal user of Pandora since shortly after they launched. I've officially been converted. It seems the hype wasn't unfounded.",Positive
52,53,Spotify,ViCO C.,2,88,It stopped playing after screen was off for couple minutes on Samsung S10. Need to allow background activity in phone setting in order to work properly. Background data usage also needs to be on for non-premium account/not downloaded contents. But it drains battery much faster than previous versions. Facewidget 95% time not working on always on display. Probably 50% chance works on locked screen now but it worked fine on my previous Samsung phone. Quite disappointed.,Negative
53,54,Spotify,summer jane,4,1,"Spotify is my music app. I have premium and use it daily. I love it! The colors, easy to use features, customizable options, etc flows so smoothly and by far makes the app different than any other. Alas, today I noticed my first glitch after YEARS of using Spotify.

Like many other people I have to constantly log in and out to get the controls on my lock screen/notification bar, or have the music stop when I use ok Google.

57,58,Spotify,Mo oj,2,9,"I'm sorry, Spotify, but I have to knock your apps rating from 5 stars to 2. Let me preface by saying the service is great and you have pretty much any music I am ever looking for. However, your most recent updates have gotten rid of one of my most used features: ""New Releases"". No reason to get rid of this. Sure, your Playlist are good, but I can get that for free with Pandora. But sometimes I want to see what's new and I don't always know what's new. I know others have argued this too.",Positive
58,59,Spotify,Rucha Deshmukh,4,4,I love this app. Loads of songs. But I don't know why you changed the playlist section in the update. Earlier I was able to play any song I wished from my playlist. Now Spotify wants me to listen to a song I want to skip. In one hr 6 skips are available!! Why!?? And when we open the playlist we only get the song preview!! It doesn't feel like it's my app on my phone. Please change this.,Positive

Except that, this is my permanent music streamer now.",Positive
61,62,Spotify,Caerid Lock,5,2,"Overall a great program. customer service has always been great, the few issues I've had over the years have always been addressed quickly and successfully. I've been a user since 2012. I do pay for the premium because the incessant ads for the free version drive me crazy. So I would say 5 stars for premium, 3 stars for the free version. Forr me this is a daily, essential program.",Positive
62,63,Spotify,Anth T.,5,5,"Love this app, totally worth the monthly subscription. The only thing I wish it had is a seek bar for the lock screen. Updated 4/12 I'm still hoping for a ""Seek Bar"" for the lock screen. I was also messing around with the equalizer and now I'm trying to figure out how to fully disable it. Still love the app.... the only music app that I need!",Positive
63,64,Spotify,Craig Gibson,5,4179,"i have over 170 songs on only one of my playlists! and you can make many playlists, and find any songs you want! if apps could tell you how many hours you have spent on an app, i would probably have about 100+. Premium is the best to have while using this app. if yiu dont want to spend $10 a month on an app, then you could use the free version, which is the one you use when you first download the app. I use premium though. which is worth it 100 percent, every pennie! Like music? then download!",Positive
64,65,Spotify,John Chevillot,5,1,"When Amazon Prime music cut a huge percentage of their choices available to me, Spotify became the obvious choice.

65,66,Spotify,Tavish Gupta,1,4,"Where's my play queue? Shuffle button? Liked songs in random order? Very un-intuitive UI. The old one looked better. Edited - multiple updates later, and the issue still exists. With these issues and no Warner Bros songs, it's hard to subscribe to premium.",Positive
66,67,Spotify,Prasanna A,5,37,After waiting for years. Spotify finally launched in India. from it already long list of playlist to ever growing list of new songs in each genre. with regional hits as well. with spotify connect it works seamless with all my device. essentially acting as a remote. even though Premium seems a bit pricy it is totally worth the features it offers. I recommend it to anyone who has a taste for music.,Positive

Though I have been able to upgrade smoothly, I know one person who couldn't upgrade to Premium. He wanted to upgrade so bad, but he couldn't. Spotify offers 3 months for just 149, and you could pay with mobile load, it only supports the carriers Smart, and Globe (in PH). This is the plan he wanted to get.

I can make my own play lists without people knowing about it so it isa great way to have privacy. I think it would be nice if you could make some explicit songs and get rid of the explicit words.

4850,4851,AmazonMusic,John Engels,4,0,"It is a good app but not perfect. Some albums have the same songs 2 or even 3 times listed so while you want to listen to an album you might hear the same song over and over again before the next track. Also if songs are not available anymore in your music and you want to delete the album, if there are more than 2 or 3 of the same songs listed it might one delete the 10 out of 20 songs. Then you will have to go in and delete each of the 10 songs one at a time which becomes time consuming.",Negative

Started off really well but now frustrated and considering other options.,Negative
5338,5339,AmazonMusic,jeanette supinski,5,0,Love being able to listen to stations and marking songs thumbs up or down. It's like customizing your own station and not dealing with songs you dislike or commercials. Plus being able to just skip a song is great. Awesome app!,Positive

But compared to itunes/play music functionality/ui needs updating but the real killer is the unresponsive ui /stalls when starting music - downloading song/album onto device makes very little difference.

It rarely locks up or has problems and I listen to music almost exclusively thru the app now in my car or anywhere. Purchases can easily be made thru the app. I no longer buy CDs and I love that I can listen to an entire album release and oick and choose which songs to download to my device for off line listening.

The clarity of these old songs also have been improved upon, enhancing the listening pleasure. only couple of requests from my side: 1) add a timer option in the settings so that the app automatically shuts off; this is useful while listening at night, when one tends to doze off 2) allow for sorting ( alphabetical ) of songs within a personal playlist",Positive

6837,6838,AmazonMusic,Tara G,1,0,Certain songs just have problems with playback (maybe 3 out of 5 times) and then the whole thing freezes up. When that happens it takes forever to do anything. I really want to love the app. I'm so suprised this is still a problem.,Positive

6840,6841,AmazonMusic,Joe Powers,1,15,"I'm a prime member for years, so I expect this app to at least be average since it's touted as one of the membership benefits.  But it's poor.  How poor?  Well when I stream a station like I would on Pandora, it errors out on numerous songs included in the station.  So you have to stop what you are doing, skip that song, and hit play again to continue.  It's a jarring discontinuity.  Forget using it as background music at your party.  Like right now ANY Ed Sheeran song kills the stream.  Even worse, there is a button to report the problem.  If you fill that all out and hit send, after a few days you get an undeliverable message back on the email account you used to file to bug report that the recipient isn't valid (and it's auto filled in mind you).  So not only doesn't Amazon care that the app doesn't work, they also don't even care enough to make sure that they can receive your complaint so they can pretend they are looking at bugs.  And it's been this way for months.  I never write app reviews, but this one has ticked me off enough, for a service I'M PAYING FOR, that it really deserves to just be viciously roasted.  Thanks for listening.",Negative

But i like salsa, vallenatos, regue, soka and Rock in Spanish. I don't know if you see the difference but for us the difference is huge. Latin music have a lot of differents generous.

Amazon needs to fix this.",Positive
6843,6844,AmazonMusic,Richard Boer,5,62,"First time using the app was on a road trip. Not sure why I hadn't used it sooner. I just set the station like a radio station, and connect it to the cars Bluetooth. Using the buttons on the steering wheel to replay songs I like and skipping forward past the ones I didn't. No breaks in play, even through Kansas, so assume there's some buffering for when you don't have internet.",Positive

Right now you cant play any songs in your offline playlist if you've chosen to listen to music online. Surely you should be able to access ALL your music/playlists while you're online, because you're... online!

Any type, decade, soundtracks, genres. You can download any song, artist, similar music, or album. You can listen offline or stream online. The sound quality is amazing. I downloaded & tried nearly every music player, equalizer & mp3 bass booster apps in Google Play & APK & none could compare to Amazon music. It's my favorite app. Thanks to developer for perfect music app!!",Positive

9672,9673,AppleMusic,Lee Davis,4,0,"Fine selection, and it works every bit as well on Android as it does on IOS. It would be nice if there were a way to move downloaded music to expandable storage on Android devices so we could save space on our phones and tablets. I can see how this may seem redundant with the streaming of music but let's face it -not everybody has perfect reception everywhere and many people who go through non-contract service could very easily have a data cap that at best bottnecks their connection speeds. This can make Apple look bad due to their streaming service not streaming due to frequently buffering. And for those who have a data cap that shuts off their data once they've reached a small limit of data then the streaming service is useless because they cannot stream the content -again making Apple look bad. This can all be avoided by allowing the downloaded music to be saved on expandable storage improving the users experience with Apple services and there fore improving Apple's image. Do I actually expect the notion of Apple allowing the use of expandable storage? Not at all really. But this is my review and I do think that that the feature of allowing the downloaded content to be saved on expandable storage would vastly improve the experience especially for those having to use a lower end device.",Positive

But get this, songs will STILL BUFFER when I hit play. Even worse, viewing the downloaded album's song list page somehow requires connection to the cell network, so even when I want to browse my downloaded music, the screen won't load if I'm not connected to a cell network... I can't stand it. At times when I've run out of data, I can no longer listen to music. It instantly ruins my mood, even if I'm happy and pleasant beforehand. Apple, if you see this, FIX THIS ISSUE. I'm not the only one that encounters this, a lot of my friends experience the same issue or similar issues related to the app being so irrationally dependent on connection to a cell network. This issue makes hitting next a stressful endeavor, because I never know if the next song will buffer for 3 minutes instead of instantly playing LIKE A DOWNLOADED SONG SHOULD DO.

I've had some problems though, sometimes it gives me two ads in a row and I'm sure if its supposed to do that. I know that a function of Pandora is that it recommends songs for you based on what you listen to, but often it plays songs that are nothing like what I listen to, even if I click dislike on them similar songs keep showing up.

14485,14486,Pandora,A Google user,3,6,It's a good app. But all I wanna do is cancel my subscription and continue to use the free version and I'm getting the run around on how to do it because I changed phones from when I originally started to subscribe. I went from android to apple. It'd be great if there was an easier way to go about it instead of me looking for over an hour and counting on how to do this. Other than that this app would be great. Also it'd be nice to have a phone service that actually answers instead of a machine that says we don't help you over the phone you have to email us for support. What kind of business model is that. Pandora your great but you fall severally short on the customer service side of things. Also would it kill you to play a wider variety of music on certain channels. Just because I haven't specifically liked someone doesn't mean that I just wanna listen to the same 50 songs every time I go to that channel. I like the songs and I like the people and I wanna continue to listen to them but maybe put some lesser known artist in the mix and expand peoples music bases so they don't seem so one lined.,Positive

My only real drawback is that there is no queue feature. Spotify and Soundcloud, have it, so why can't they have it too?

It's more convenient than listening to my iPod, even though I'm aware of Apple music .Only thing I'd like so far is the ability to thumbs up tracks without having to go into Pandora whenever my phone is idle and shows only the current track and artist playing.

The last few times though that I went into an area that didn't have coverage, when I started Pandora, it kept trying to connect (showing the pulsing P) then when it couldn't connect, it would just give the option to retry or cancel (which exited the app). I get that there has to be some kind of periodic check that the license is updated, but I've been caught out by this enough times for it to become an aggravation. What's worse is that it's not always predictable when I'm going to a bad service area, so by the time I think to open Pandora to let it check the license, it's already too late.",Negative

Also, their algorithms are more than likely outdated at the time of this review; I have stand up comedy popping up on my classic rock station & Kendrick Lamar playing on my Blink 182.

Even the premium service in Pandora is a joke the number one feature I looked for when I used it was the ability to just listen to the songs that I liked but even that wasn't a feature that they actually offered when you went to do it it said some of these songs are only available through Radio play and didn't offer to just skip those songs outright didn't allow me to do it. It just repeats the same songs in the same order. Now I'm at my last straw when I start the application it just sits there it doesn't even do anything.

I have been a loyal customer for many years and listened all the time,  I recently experienced a hard drive crash and lost everything.

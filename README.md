Project Classification: Type II
Introduction:
This project aims to compare Music Applications such as Pandora, Spotify and Amazon music by using scrapped data (user reviews) from Google Playstore.
Application of sentiment analysis technique using Python on user reviews. Comparison of Music applications on the basis of four essential factors such as Cost, Collection, Stability of Application and Advertisement. 
Additionally, portraying a sentiment score on user in order to give the user a perception of their review on the Internet before they upload the review. 

Literature Review: 
Music apps have revolutionized the way people listen to music in this era. Music apps have provided artists and audiences with a platform to share content and  enjoy music
In this growing age of technology and music where there is cut throat competition and plenty of options for the  users to listen from, user reviews and their impact play a more significant role than ever. 
Our aim through this project is to see what user preferences are through an analysis of their reviews and see which app garners the maximum levels of satisfaction. 

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Website Scrapping: 
Performed Web Scrapping on User reviews from the Google play store using selenium package in order to automate web browser interaction from Python. Used ChromeDriver to launch and perform tasks on Google play store.  
Sentimental Analysis using VADER:
Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media. It uses a combination of  sentiment lexicon which is a list of lexical features (e.g., words) which are generally labelled according to their semantic orientation as either positive, negative or neutral. 

Aspect Based Analysis:
Analyzed each review to identify various aspects such as Cost, Collection, Advertisement and Stability of App and determined the corresponding sentiment for each of these factors. Customers are more vocal than ever. They love leaving feedback – good and bad – making them a valuable resource for businesses

Summary: 
Listening to music can affect people emotions. They can experience simultaneous feelings, such as happiness and hope, or sadness and angry, when a song is being played. However, inferring emotions that can be caused by a musical fragment is a complex task. To deduce relationships between feelings and music, we propose a sentiment analysis method based on data mining. In particular, different musical features are extracted and classified to analyze the influence of some music parameters on human emotions.

Hypothesis: 
1. Amazon music's low cost structure packaged with amazon prime membership would make it a popular app gaining higher public attention as compared to Pandora and Spotify. 
2. Pandora's free version gains more attention in the market within a certain age range although its advertisements can act as interruptions. 
3. Spotify's immense music playlist collection and diverse genres  with a very low subscription rate has gained competitive edge in the music industry.  

Results:
After running the code, we found that Pandora offers great and diverse music choices. This rejects our hypothesis as Pandora's immense music playlist collection and diverse genres with a very low subscription rate has gained competitive edge in the music industry.
Based on the cost factor, Amazon music and Pandora being free makes them popular gaining high attention in the market.
Pandora's free version gains more attention, but after analysing it on Advertisement scale, it offers a lot of interruptions which also proves our hypothesis true.

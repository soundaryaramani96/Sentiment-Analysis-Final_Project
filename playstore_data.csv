1,Spotify,RealTRG,5,2,Ich finde Spotify sehr gut. Die Lieder haben eine hohe QualitÃ¤t und das Design sieht sehr gut aus. Der Support war auch sehr hilfsbereit und hat mir bei meinen Problemen geholfen und sie auf gelÃ¶st. DankeschÃ¶n ^^
2,Spotify,Lokan,1,7,Fix the adaptive icon please ðŸ˜­
3,Spotify,Abhilash Ulahannan,2,1,"missing a lot of songs i like, not really a fan of indian content. i like alterbrigde, slipknot and led Zeppelin which is missing. i dont understand why i even bought the premium version. while i enjoyed US content in free version using vpn. I like everything about spotify except this. I understand rights issue, but it isnt going good enough for me."
4,Spotify,Michele LaBlanc,4,12,Overall great app. Love that I can have multiple playlists. Very few songs I've searched for have been unavailable. Only complaint: after the last update I can no longer scroll the song screen to share the song on FB or in text. Every time I try to scroll Spotify crashes. I miss that feature. Please fix. =)
5,Spotify,Makara Bedell,5,7,"it's good and all, but ur recent update is trash. Bc usually I'll put my playlist on shuffle and if I dont feel like listening to that song I'll just play a different one but now I can't do that."
6,Spotify,A Google user,5,116,"I love this app its the only thing that helps me get through my day! Now I do have the paid verson, but it's worth it. Spotify is so far the best music app I ever had. #TeamSpotify"
7,Spotify,Dat Vu,4,21,"Spotify is a great streaming service, but for gods sake please bring back the old icon. This new icon is blacked around the edge and looks unbalanced with other icons."
8,Spotify,Morroq TrÃ©pas,5,14,"I really love this app, it's super convenient and I have a ton of music always available. I'd say the one thing I'd really like to be able to do is close the app and still have my music run in the background (like the default music player does.)"
9,Spotify,Elisha Fernandes,2,7,Lots of more artists to be added missing out out on a lot of songs ðŸ™„
10,Spotify,Jordan Mitchell,1,2,why cant all my saved music be automatically grouped together in one playist so i can just shuffle all of my music when i want to? if i want all my music in one playist i have to like each individual song which is really inconvenient considering all the music i listen to is around 10000 songs and im not about to go through every single song and like them so i can have them in one playist together to be able to just shuffle all of my music. step back from previous UI in my opinion.
11,Spotify,leto B,3,61,Very unstable and has far too many bugs for the amount we pay!
12,Spotify,Firdous Alam,5,2,awesome app... Just need a debit card payment option for yearly plans...since not everyone in india has credit cards.
13,Spotify,Antony Larrick,4,1,"Great, but every once in a while there are obnoxious updates."
14,Spotify,Rajat Rao,3,3,"A lot of music is missing from the Indian library, fix it!"
15,Spotify,Juan Magana,5,1,great app highly recommend
16,Spotify,Vaibhav singhwal,5,5,Best music streaming app
17,Spotify,dzudud bdjdjr,1,5,Hate the new icon.
18,Spotify,Juanda Ramirez,5,8,Solo puedo decir que es la mejor app que hay.
19,Spotify,chxrlieb,4,1,good but my premium doesn't work when I'm offline. the songs don't play.

35,Spotify,Elias Bader,5,0,Awesome
36,Spotify,the fusion gamer v2,1,11,Bad
37,Spotify,Discord,3,1,it's good but we need to be able to play all the songs like the old times
38,Spotify,Shinnosuke Delacruz,5,34,"Loved it, it's a much modern and unique UI and still packs all the music that I love. It's a smooth experience and I'm loving every second of it. For those who are having issues with your playlist--not playing any songs after listening to all the songs (songs not included in the playlist itself) Go to your settings then enable auto-play. If there's a big change to an app, check the settings if there's something that the developers changed or ""improved."" Just take a look and check everything."
39,Spotify,maverick mamaghani,2,1,"disclaimer: 2-star rating is for Android. I rate Spotify experience on iPhone at 4.5 stars. Here's why: â€¢ Left Swipe option to Queue, only works on iOS â€¢â€¢ Earphone Triple Click to rewind or go to the previous track, right? No. only available on iOS version. Why make such a basic feature exclusive to iPhone? Spotify Premium worth it if you own an iPhone, but if you own a Pixel or a Galaxy you might wanna consider saving your buck$$ YouTube Music."
40,Spotify,Michael Mercier,3,0,"cool, I gave five stars to a group who has so screwed up their platform that I am investigating Pandora. I appreciate that all my podcast downloads just don't. I appreciate losing functionality on my WiFi headphones. stuff I listened to last night as a downloaded is not downloaded this morning. I need to go to work, why do I have to restart and reload... took the battery out of my frigging phone... still, my downloads that were there yesterday are gone... I will decide to cancel."
41,Spotify,Rokas Krivaitis,4,24,"Awesome app and service, especially with the student discount and recent redesign. But there are things that I would change. I can't seem to find the entire song list in the artist page. Also the theming between live and static album covers is quite different. A single consistent theme would look more pleasing in my opinion. Other than that the sound quality is great and the multiple platform support is phenomenal. Keep up the good work."
42,Spotify,Garv Banerji,5,0,"I love how the app generally works. The quality of music streaming using this service is amazing. The integration with my Android phone and Waze is amazing. The user interface is simple and easy to use, which is a pro for me. Apple Music didn't make anything easy to get with my old iPhone. Over all the integration, convenience, and quality all check of as a 10/10. I haven't experienced any bugs with the app at all. I can even download music so I can listen to my music peacefully."
43,Spotify,Clement Trotman,1,4,"Eq Sucks!!! It dampers sound, doesn't expand or enhance it. Many tunes are missing and that you would expect to be found. The ads: claim they will provide you 30 mins of free listen. Which is a ""LIE""!! Also they freeze your device, from time to time. Where your going too, have to reset your device. Now the hands-free wont connect via Bluetooth, to the car kenwood deck. cant use remote or deck commands, to NO LONG operate!!!"
44,Spotify,josh rathbun,2,3,This app is slowly going downhill. Every update changes the way songs are alphabetized and it's slowly becoming less user friendly. Why can't I search by my downloaded artist anymore? Why when I select a song from my library does the shuffle turn off? I miss the spotify I had a year ago when it was easy to use and didn't change every month
45,Spotify,Nandhu Krishnan,2,0,"finally after releasing in India, loved the app except the fact that I can't play a song which is in my language. I could accept if that was for a song from other countries but what about the one from my own? does buying premium membership set that off?? Is that why its like not playable? I'd rather stick to SoundCloud or Saavn! thanks( only reason losing 3 stars is this. Not much use when a music app cannot play music ðŸ¤·ðŸ»â€â™‚)"
46,Spotify,Chawakorn Chaichanawirote,1,1,"this used to be the best paid music streaming service for me, now Spotify Premium is indistinguishable from the free version. They removed the all songs option which I used quite often. Now in offline mode I can't see any playlist or albums since I haven't downloaded complete albums or playlists yet, even though I have 16 gb of music on my device. Why would you remove features like this? I'm going back to apple music if this doesn't change."
47,Spotify,FREDDY ROCK,1,1,"you know it would be a good music app, but when you go to search half the time even with a good internet connection it takes 15 to 30 seconds to even load anything. it's 2019 and this thing acts like it just got released and 1998. fix your app.just because you're becoming a big name brand like Netflix and Hulu doesn't mean you have to make your customers suffer now due to your lazy techs. this is not worth $10 a month."
48,Spotify,andrew bush,3,2,"I absolutely love spotify. 100 percent. but as a chef and a chef that has a staff that uses pandora. id love to be able to make ""stations"" of our favorite artist like pandora does in a way. otherwise spotify is the goat for bringing you the latest music at your fingertip. to elaborate. with pandora my staff can add artist to pandora station and it will cycle in music from and like the artist. thats the only ""complaint"" i have if Spotify does this. i wanna know how"
49,Spotify,ronyoshii,1,33,"Pretty good selection of music. Even some pretty niche videogame and chip tune music. Even still, the algorithm will more often recommend under tale. Gotta chill that. (edit: new update took away the ability to store music etc on sd card. would give more stars if features weren't taken away.) (edit 2: now i no longer have the ability to use a sleep timer which is howi fall asleep to podcasts without it playing indefinitely. why are features bring removed instead of improved?)"
50,Spotify,Jean Rivera,2,8,"Why did you removed the filter bar from the top of the playlists? It was so easy to quickly filter my huge list of songs. The added step is completely unnecessary as it worked perfectly before, please change it back. Also, im not sure how i feel about the song menu taking the entire screen. You guys can can do a better job with it."
51,Spotify,Nate Zittnan,5,25,"Great UI, all the music you could ever want, and they reccomend music that you might like through the Discover Weekly playlist. By the way, this is not a paid review, I just love this app. If you don't have it, get it. Hulu is also included with Spotify Premium, which is great and adds even more value to the $10 monthly subscription."
52,Spotify,Ashe Odinson,4,9,"Right out the gate, I was impressed with the intuitive system for adding liked artists. I don't know how many showed up after picking a similar artist, making me repeatedly say ""I forgot about that band!"" I've rediscovered plenty of old favorites this way. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is the shortness of the playlists. I was a loyal user of Pandora since shortly after they launched. I've officially been converted. It seems the hype wasn't unfounded."
53,Spotify,ViCO C.,2,88,It stopped playing after screen was off for couple minutes on Samsung S10. Need to allow background activity in phone setting in order to work properly. Background data usage also needs to be on for non-premium account/not downloaded contents. But it drains battery much faster than previous versions. Facewidget 95% time not working on always on display. Probably 50% chance works on locked screen now but it worked fine on my previous Samsung phone. Quite disappointed.
54,Spotify,summer jane,4,1,"Spotify is my music app. I have premium and use it daily. I love it! The colors, easy to use features, customizable options, etc flows so smoothly and by far makes the app different than any other. Alas, today I noticed my first glitch after YEARS of using Spotify. It did p!nk dirty and wouldnt play the first half of a song (""Better Life"" </3)but I hope this is resolved soon! much love, :)"
55,Spotify,Tom Woerner,1,64,"I use Spotify all day, the new update is trash though. Like many other people I have to constantly log in and out to get the controls on my lock screen/notification bar, or have the music stop when I use ok Google. Normally love this app and have no issue with the $10 per month. Will gladly change to 5 stars when this is fixed."
56,Spotify,Fred Aghaby,3,8,"Used to be a 5-star app for me, until recently. The app re-downloads my playlists every other day since I moved my library to external storage. Not only do I have to move it back to external every time, but it doesn't overwrite the previously saved data. TL;DR: Spotify takes about twice the amount of storage it should on my device because reasons."
57,Spotify,Gacha Wolf Lya,2,4,"i would have vote it a 5 if i can download the music without paying or the shuffle buttons isnt present. Whenever i want to start a song, i would always have to click the shuffle button. and also i always can't go back on the song i wanted when i accidentally click the next song button. i also wish that we can listen to the songs at aby time (aka like youtube)"
58,Spotify,Mo oj,2,9,"I'm sorry, Spotify, but I have to knock your apps rating from 5 stars to 2. Let me preface by saying the service is great and you have pretty much any music I am ever looking for. However, your most recent updates have gotten rid of one of my most used features: ""New Releases"". No reason to get rid of this. Sure, your Playlist are good, but I can get that for free with Pandora. But sometimes I want to see what's new and I don't always know what's new. I know others have argued this too."
59,Spotify,Rucha Deshmukh,4,4,I love this app. Loads of songs. But I don't know why you changed the playlist section in the update. Earlier I was able to play any song I wished from my playlist. Now Spotify wants me to listen to a song I want to skip. In one hr 6 skips are available!! Why!?? And when we open the playlist we only get the song preview!! It doesn't feel like it's my app on my phone. Please change this.
60,Spotify,Henry Paradiz,3,0,The continued advertising of services I do not use and will never use (Hulu) in a paid music app will eventually get me to cancel and go back to pirating. Considering that I already listen to a lot of free music outside of Spotify the value proposition that Spotify offers is becoming less and less worthwhile. You're already on thin ice as is.
61,Spotify,GODS O TECH,5,2,"it's been a good experience till now. It just got released in India and I'm happy it did. It has good features even in the freemium version. There's actually no requirement of the premium. The only thing is some songs aren't available to play in my country. Any help with this. Except that, this is my permanent music streamer now."
62,Spotify,Caerid Lock,5,2,"Overall a great program. customer service has always been great, the few issues I've had over the years have always been addressed quickly and successfully. I've been a user since 2012. I do pay for the premium because the incessant ads for the free version drive me crazy. So I would say 5 stars for premium, 3 stars for the free version. Forr me this is a daily, essential program."
63,Spotify,Anth T.,5,5,"Love this app, totally worth the monthly subscription. The only thing I wish it had is a seek bar for the lock screen. Updated 4/12 I'm still hoping for a ""Seek Bar"" for the lock screen. I was also messing around with the equalizer and now I'm trying to figure out how to fully disable it. Still love the app.... the only music app that I need!"
64,Spotify,Craig Gibson,5,4179,"i have over 170 songs on only one of my playlists! and you can make many playlists, and find any songs you want! if apps could tell you how many hours you have spent on an app, i would probably have about 100+. Premium is the best to have while using this app. if yiu dont want to spend $10 a month on an app, then you could use the free version, which is the one you use when you first download the app. I use premium though. which is worth it 100 percent, every pennie! Like music? then download!"
65,Spotify,John Chevillot,5,1,"When Amazon Prime music cut a huge percentage of their choices available to me, Spotify became the obvious choice. With the family plan it's very reasonable, sound quality is excellent, and despite having very wide ranging and diverse music tastes, Spotify gets me far better than any other streaming experience."
66,Spotify,Tavish Gupta,1,4,"Where's my play queue? Shuffle button? Liked songs in random order? Very un-intuitive UI. The old one looked better. Edited - multiple updates later, and the issue still exists. With these issues and no Warner Bros songs, it's hard to subscribe to premium."
67,Spotify,Prasanna A,5,37,After waiting for years. Spotify finally launched in India. from it already long list of playlist to ever growing list of new songs in each genre. with regional hits as well. with spotify connect it works seamless with all my device. essentially acting as a remote. even though Premium seems a bit pricy it is totally worth the features it offers. I recommend it to anyone who has a taste for music.
68,Spotify,Jocelyn Ramirez,3,0,"I really like using Spotify, but with the recent update it has not worked the same. The music stops playing after a few songs, so I have to go back into the app for it to start playing again. I have tried clearing the cache, deleting and downloading again, and restarting my phone. Nothing seems to be working, so I might just switch to another app."
69,Spotify,Alex Oss.,5,1,Great service. Need refining after last few updates. Haven't had any issues for years then 2 updates ago all Bluetooth and even lock screen control stops working. Most recent update hardly fixed the issue. I can now pause music through Bluetooth but have to unlock my phone and manually resume music. Please fix this quick. Edit: after the April 9th update everything works great! Best service out there!
70,Spotify,Kyle McBride,1,3,"phone, service or app? Since the update in December my spotify has three different versions. some collapsed screen thing. Doesn't work during lock screen. Then the quick version with 3 big buttons and the song name. Third version the normal app can't be controlled from anything out of having it open on your screen."
71,Spotify,Nlemchukwu Innocent,4,0,"love this app... its given me every song I've thot of, and more! however if those ads that pop up every 10 mins or so cud be cut to just the ones that pop up before the first song plays? it wud be a 5 star rating from me. keep up the good work guys!"
72,Spotify,Bianca Evaristo,4,0,"I've been using Spotify for quite some time now, and I have upgraded to Spotify Premium. Though I have been able to upgrade smoothly, I know one person who couldn't upgrade to Premium. He wanted to upgrade so bad, but he couldn't. Spotify offers 3 months for just 149, and you could pay with mobile load, it only supports the carriers Smart, and Globe (in PH). This is the plan he wanted to get. But his carrier is different, I just wanted to suggest to support other carriers as well, to be fair."
73,Spotify,Caitlin Stewart,5,9,For a long time I was downloading music and tracks that didn't work off of the Internet and putting them on my phone just to find out they didn't work. Used multiple music apps such as music paradise and still finding it hard to get great tracks. Spotify has not let me down yet and I make and manage all my Playlists straight from my phone. It's so simple to use
74,Spotify,Shane G,2,0,"So i downloaded almost 200 songs so far. 3 or 4 times the app downloads the songs all over again and that's a big hit on my ""unlimited"" limited data plan. So what gives? Why does the app continue to download songs I've already downloaded a few times? Am i missing something here? Aside from this issue, i absolutely love Spotify."
75,Spotify,Sagar Bansal,5,0,"i love this app and have been using it from the last 3 years. But after it's india launch, I am able to listen my favourite bands. Content is too shifted towards hindi music and bollywood as compare to the past. I really want to switch back location to the US instead of US"
76,Spotify,Marisa Milner,2,162,"I have a Galaxy S9 and I have to unlock my phone every single time I want to skip a song. As you can imagine, this is quite annoying. Also, when I filter an artist in a specific playlist, after the first song it goes back to the rest of the playlist instead of what is filtered. Why give the option if I'm going to have to keep going back in and selecting a song? I added specific songs from specific artists because not everyone likes every song. please fix the former. It's irritating and I pay."
77,Spotify,Abbey Tan,1,1,"Spotify all of a sudden logged me out of my account so I tried to sign back in but I forgot my passward. I simply just chose the reset password option but every time I click on the button given to me through the email, it says the link is expired. So now I can't even use my spotify account."
78,Spotify,Gideon Peine,5,1,I love it because it recommend songs to me that I actually like now and download songs and be able to listen WITHOUT wifi! I can make my own play lists without people knowing about it so it isa great way to have privacy. I think it would be nice if you could make some explicit songs and get rid of the explicit words. I also think it would be nice to be able to see the words that they sing. I would rate this a 8 from 1 to 5. I have many more reasons why I LOVE Spotify!!!
79,Spotify,David Thompson,5,2,"I've tried other music apps and this is the best one about listening to an entire album in order. it might sound funny, but it's important in classical music. I was afraid to ""like"", let's say, an aria from an opera. If I did, i would get recommendations/suggested playlists of 32 other people singing the same aria. No thanks, I'll stick with my Spitufy."
80,Spotify,A Google user,5,0,"thank you guys so much for this blessing of an app. my life was so dull without this. i can't imagine that it's about 3 years now since i first used this app. spotify helped me find the most WONDERFUL broadway musicals and got me so into theater and y'all basically the reason of who i am now. spotify and all of your wonderful staff, ya'll amazing. â™¡"
81,Spotify,Keith Giberson,5,1,"EDIT for 2019: the app has come a long way from it's rough beginning. device connectivity works fine, app presentation and navigation is great. Music library is unmatched by any competitor. original review: This apps ability to integrate via spotify connect is laughable. It's just easier to use an RDP client. But it's spotify, why fix finicky connect issues"
82,Spotify,Dustin Grogan,5,0,"I missed you, Spotify. Tried Tidal and YouTube Music for the past few months and YIKES... it's nice using an app that feels feature rich and has literally every song on the planet. Thanks for all the great work, dev team! I'll never leave you again!"
83,Spotify,Dingle D. Dingus,1,2,"I watched the ad to get 30 minutes of no ads. I listened to ONE SONG and immediately got an ad. This isn't the first time this has happened just the first time I've decided to leave a review about it. The ads in general are dumb. Sometimes I get to listen to two songs and get SIX ads afterwards. Please fix your app, Spotify. I love the playlists, I love the easy music finding, I love being recommended new music. I just hate the constant ads."
84,Spotify,Steven Woodard,5,0,have to say spotify has gotten better over the years. been requesting album from sonique song name it feels so good for years and they finally added it. they also have so many other albums I love and never deleted them. hands down spotify is my forever music app hands down.
85,Spotify,Denver Johnson,5,0,This is the best music app there is. Hands down the other major apps do not come close. My spotify account has been active for 10 years and it has broaded my horizons musicaly. It suggest things based off of your tastes. Which have almost aleays been spot on. So if you want to listen for free choose spotify. If want to have axcess to the coolest music collection in the world go pro. With spotify pro its commercail free interruption free. i recomend this app to all my friends. so hit install^.
86,Spotify,Kris Lin,3,0,"Switching from Apple to Android is tough considering the fact that you can't swipe left to queue songs or swipe right to download them for offline listening. I've been a longtime spotify listener and, seeing this change in the next update or so would be great!"
87,Spotify,Kevin Morales,5,0,"I use it everyday, but sometimes it can be REALLY slow. Plus I'd appreciate a quicker access to my downloaded music (Spotify Premium) without needing the Internet to access music I downloaded for offline use. Other than that, Spotify is great and I love making playlists with this service! EDIT: I got a faster device now. This app is oerfect."
88,Spotify,A Google user,3,2,New update is garbage this used to be a 5 star app. Now I give it 3. I got excited for the new UI and see new things but you took away the ability shuffle all the music I have save. I can no longer store my music. My library is gone. And my daily play lists are now all over the place with genres. I never used Amazon music or Google music becuse I didn't like the ui. But I'm about to switch if this dosnt get resolved. Ps. My music stops when my screen is locked. I am a extreamly dissatisfied cust
89,Spotify,Justin LaChapelle,2,10,"was great until an update two months ago. Now the app keeps stopping in the middle of songs and I have to go back into the app to press play, and the song resets. It's very inconvenient and frustrating. I'm a premium member, and I'm one more frustrating day from asking for my money back from the last three months."
90,Spotify,Christian Julianto,5,0,"damnit its a really good app. you get what you pay for. damn u dont even have to pay if you can handle several ads. 320kbps, easy access to most artist album. customized playlist, daily music recommendation (well its not that accurate but its enough), offline download, and you can open it to several device, making long distance control easier."
91,Spotify,Kaio Henrique,5,998,"I love Spotify, been using it for years, but it's cost me one SD Card. They can't read the songs on my SD if I remove it and put it back, but it keeps taking up space on it. Now I have a bug that I can't see the songs in an artist folder, I have to look for it somewhere else like albuns, (I have this on some artists, some not). The quality is amazing and the app is great (dark mode), but the now playing screen for non-payers looks better than for payers. Can't find some great songs on it, too."
92,Spotify,Vita-Kyte,1,1,"i'm paying 100+ bucks a year to listen to music, but i still cant listen to music while others are listening to music, which makes sense. but on android there is an option to set spotify to offline mode so i can only listen to songs i have downloads but i can listen even when others aren't, which isn't that bad of a trade of to be honest, but in the most recent update, the app still checks to see if someone else is listening to music so i can't listen in turn. this needs to come back. 1 star"
93,Spotify,caleb kaas,5,0,"I've used a ton of music apps but Spotify won me over. With its selection of music, the user interface, and the functionality come together and make this amazing product that puts a smile on your face and joy in your heart every time you open it."
94,Spotify,Mack van Rossem,2,0,"App is quite buggy. Not nearly as polished as expected for an industry standard. Great selection obviously, but playback controls leave me wanting. Why can't they just mimic VLC? I wish it had the ability to queue songs to both next and end of the playlist (play next vs play later). I am currently reinstalling it, and having to re download my entire library, because it was bugging out and giving me a ""you discovered a premium feature!"" message when I was clearly already premium and logged in."
95,Spotify,Vishvak,5,0,"Spotify is the most used music player not because of the wide variety of songs or podcasts, it is because of the generic playlists and the mood it composes. if you are stressed out try listening to ""Calm Down"" playlist on your way home. Thank me later ;)"
96,Spotify,Robert Popescu,2,0,Could you please optimize it better? Lately it stops working constantly.. Like for instance i d play a song and i couldnt it wouldnt pause no matter what i do and i wouldnt be able to open any other page on it to see or play other songs it just keeps loading even if i close the app the song keeps playing
97,Spotify,stewart miller,1,1,"I've been a customer ' that means I pay' for a very long time, always been happy, until now. apparently the latest version of the app which has been running for about 3 weeks now, has a problem. doesn't work correctly ,has lost some of its features, and tech support really seems to be doing anything about it. I have spent a lot of hours communicating with them only to finally be told- yes it's an issue, and that's about it. attention Spotify please fix please fix please fix please fix."
98,Spotify,Wez,2,1,There isn't a day goes by I don't listen to my favourites or find new music on here. *update* Don't know what has gone on lately with the app. Become so delayed in its response. When selecting a song it takes forever to play. Sometimes pausing a song also doesn't work until the 10th time of pressing pause.
99,Spotify,Jay Maharaul,1,11,been using Spotify for years now. but in the last few updates every update has broken one thing or another. in the most recent update either by design or by error the app no longer displays in landscape when on the post screen. really frustrating that this is a problem in 2019. I've subscribed to Google Play music if i get used to it in the next few months I'm going to cut Spotify. can't deal with the broken updates.
100,Spotify,Elizabeth Bouma,1,4,I'm disappointed by this app. It is rated high but doesn't live up to the rating. I would really like to shuffle all the songs I downloaded as opposed to adding songs individually to a playlist. I think the interface isn't as user friendly as Google Play Music and that the designers should reconsider their design.
101,Spotify,pawan Rajput,4,1,"no doubts, Spotify hold a good grip on music quality and best suggestions in music then other apps, but theres i little problem that i feel is music updates is not so quickly. I songs that released is not appears and some artists playlist don't have all songs. please fix this . in the end its an awesome music streaming app"
102,Spotify,Jesse Clanton,1,25,this app used to be amazing. and they have made it borderline unusable. i have close to 2000 songs saved as a premium user and used to be able to listen to music i had saved by artist. now my only option is a playlist with all of my saved songs (inconvenient) or by whole albums and only whole albums (also inconvenient) or go to the artist page and scroll till i find the song i want to hear (guess what? also inconvenient) make spotify great again and make the music library work like it used to!
103,Spotify,Klutzy Dragon,1,4,"Used to be great. but the new update makes most of my favorite songs not even show up on mobile devices. I'm looking for an alternative that actually let's me play my songs when and where I want, as Spotify claims to do with Premium, but is falling way short."
104,Spotify,TheeRoyal Goat,1,5,"This new update sucks. I use Spotify because it lets me listen to the artists that I like and only play their songs. Now there are all these artists in my library that I don't like but they show up anyway becauss Spotify updated. It needs to go back to the way it was before because this is stupid, there are now like 30+ new artists in my library that I don't listen to or even like."
105,Spotify,John Ray,5,0,"Spotify in any of its incarnations is my all time favorite source for streaming music. The only complaint I would admit is the forced ""shuffle"" setting in the mobile app for the free version. i realize this is ti encourage premium upgrades but, why is it ONLY the mobile app and not the PC version?"
106,Spotify,Sean M,4,1,"After 2 years, STILL WAITING TO BE ABLE TO DUMP RAP CAVIAR FROM MY HOME PAGE. I used to love Pandora, and then two years ago, my kids talked me into trying out Spotify. I've never looked back! I wish Spotify allowed the grading of the things it puts on your home or browse pages so I don't have to see Rap Caviar or R&B which I never listen to and don't want to listen to, but Spotify doesn't seem to want to listen to paying customers."
107,Spotify,Vixsixon XD,2,0,"The only reason I give this two stars is the fact that every time, and I mean every time, I go to play my playlist, it plays a song that I don't even have liked, nevermind it being on my playlist. I added songs so that the ""we added"" songs didn't pop up, but STILL added songs that I don't have added came up. And I can't even skip them or hide them with out getting premium."
108,Spotify,Lukas Kasticky,3,20,Most popular music streaming for a reason. Two thing tho: When viewing the currently playing song I want to be able to swipe down instead of pressing the small chevron. And please be consistent with the UI. Either let me use the redesign or the old one and don't switch around every tine I open the app.
109,Spotify,Travis Bass,1,2,"broken app, can't pause/skip music from lock screen and inline remote on earphones and headphones don't work with spotify while phone is locked. this issue has been happening since I updated to android 9 pie on my Samsung Galaxy s8. this is garbage I pay for a subscription and the app doesn't properly work. please fix issue so I can enjoy using the app again."
110,Spotify,Mark Moss,5,8,"You can't just simply press play on a song. It's Stuck on shuffle. You only get a couple skips per day. Terrible. Groove Music CRUSHESSSS this. Unlimited plays. Download ans play offline. Play whatever song you want, phone, Xbox, etc. Tons of music + lyrics + music videos. Spotify Cant keep up."
111,Spotify,A Google user,1,7,"i am a paying account ...Dropped to 1 star since Christmas eve 2018.... keeps randomly moving my 4gb of songs from sd card to phone memory and choke phone memory (at least once a week) Spotify can be greater if 1) it makes ""easy to reach"" buttons to toggle data on-off especially when roaming 2) intuitively stop streaming recommended songs that are not downloaded...... horrific traumatic hit on endless data streaming. 3) Sorting of albums by genres would help. 4)listening to feedback"
112,Spotify,Jericho Smith,3,0,"Wish they add their own built-in EQ setting for this app rather than using an EQ that is built-in from your phone. I have a Galaxy J7 (2015 Model) running on Android Lollipop and the built-in EQ in my phone just temporarily stops working everytime i click the previous track button until i skip or play another song. I tried installing different EQ apps but none of them seems to work for me. Please developers, add a built-in EQ for this app and I will be very happy to use this."
113,Spotify,Ryan Arbuckle,5,18,"Not sure why people complain so much. The app works perfectly, and is even better for $10/month ($5 if student). All functions work. As a Network Administrator I can tell you that the reason people have problems with navigating the app is either because of settings or network quality (searching). People will always complain... Offer a solution for a change and the developers night listen to you."
114,Spotify,Xristos Tre,5,1,"ok, it's perfect especially if you have premium. my only complaint is that the new UI sometimes, and it happens quite ofter unfortunately, gets stuck and i can't see the buttons anymore because the tab below is stuck on top of the buttons"
115,Spotify,Yoh Shiro,3,5,I only have 1 concern. It is really inconvenient that the app just logs out spontaneously and deletes all the downloaded songs and podcasts. I am subscribed for a year but I only listen to this like once in a while. It really makes me sad that I have to download everything again everytime I use the app. Sorry for the long rant. Edit 1: Apparently complaining makes the problem worse. I use the app regularly now and it logs me out automatically everytime I use it? Is this a new security feature?
116,Spotify,Justin Shell,2,79,"I've been a huge fan of spotify for about 6 years now, but here over the last 3 or 5 months the app has been terrible. Songs and podcasts randomly stop playing (with very good cellular service). You have to force close the app numerous times for songs and podcasts to play. It's really frustrating and making me want to cancel my 6+ year membership."
117,Spotify,Chelsea Lewis,1,2,"With the new update, I can no longer view all my songs that I have saved. I can only see my playlists that I have created but I had over 500 songs that I can no longer see on my list. When I look up a song , it still says it is saved onto my library. I pay for a subscription just to look up the song every single time seems like a waste of money. Time to find a new music app."
118,Spotify,Damon Sim,1,3,"There is a very annoying bug. I've tried using your app on android auto on my cars head unit. I've used two different phones and head units but the same problem happens. Whilst playing music, when Google assistant reads out my texts or I use it to search for a song on spotify, when the music resumes the quality isn't as good as before. You have to pause and click play again for the sound quality to come back. Also playback controls on my s10's lock screen also do not work."
119,Spotify,Kavya Sree Kante,5,0,thank you so much for adding K Pop. I tried a few other apps but none of them had korean songs. Thank you so much. I can't put into words how happy I am after finding spotify. Keep up the good work. #SpotifyIsDope
120,Spotify,KCP,1,11,"Since the update I can no longer control my music via. bluetooth unless the app is completely open. The music also randomly stops every 10-15 mins of use and I would have to restart the song to get it back on.I also noticed that I can no longer pause or skip songs on my locked screen, like I used to be able to. I used to love this app so much!"
121,Spotify,dhananjay verma,5,12,"I paid for premium, set streaming quality to super high yet there seems no change in sound quality. that's disgusting. Previewing songs while adding them to Playlist have better sound quality but none of other have. Truly disgusting ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜¡"
122,Spotify,Divya Kabra,1,0,I at first enjoyed the app very much but then realised I can't repeat a single song. I can do this on my laptop easily but when I go to the app I can't see the feature anywhere. I tried looking online for a solution on the community page but it's only people reporting the problem. I have seen at various places to press the three dots but that doesn't work in my case. I'll improve my review once I find the repeat one song option. Until then stay at 1 star
123,Spotify,Xander Cinderey,4,0,Spotify is an excellent service. The playlists and AI curated playlists are vry well made and seem to always to get the right mood. the quality of the tracks are superb for digital copies. The UI is complete garbage however and seems to get progressively less intuitive. This is easily fixed and would make the experience a 5/5 one at that.
124,Spotify,Mauricio Garcia,4,2,"My spotify never works, it always says its offline. i checked offline mode and it was off. only way i get it to work is to restart my phone and i only get a minute or two of online before it goes back to offline. Everything is good now (new phone) but I am still sad that Spotify didn't work with my old phone so Thats why i give 4 stars. I also wish this platform was more friendly towards new artists because there are AMAZING artist on SoundCloud that I wish were on Spotify."
125,Spotify,Trash Can,4,1,the only problem I have is that sometimes when I'm trying to get back to the home page an add will pop up and I'll try to get it off my screen and it would take me back to my song each time i tried. other than that it's a great app
126,Spotify,A Birds,3,0,"I love the Spotify app. However, since the last update, my volume increases on it's own to full volume. I had thought I found a fix by turning on the Dolby Atmos feature in the equalizer in Spotify. That seems to keep the volume at one level when it stays on. The Dolby Atmos feature turns itself off on it's own from time to time and the volume jumps to full volume again. Right now, I can't get the Dolby Atmos to turn back on so my volume keeps jumping to full blast. ugh!"
127,Spotify,pranith,5,49,I used saavn before this and wow there's so much difference in quality. The integration between phone and pc is something new for me and there has been only 1 time the software acted weird in pc but the phone app seems perfect. Music selection seems good too. For me the quality of the app mattered as saavn crashed way too often and was poorly optimised for both android and pc.
128,Spotify,Josh Rivera,5,0,"Not a damn thing that I could ask for. I've been using Spotify for a while now and I always give them props and tell friends and family about it. Now if you're reading this, get it, buy the premium and ENJOY! ITS THE BEEZ KNEES. Not paid to even say it."
129,Spotify,Philip Robinson,1,7,"With new update no longer can see individually liked songs except for in one large playlist. Very frustrating, please go back to the old layout so I can actually listen to my music and not just whatever is popular for an artist."
130,Spotify,Daruthman Abrie,3,0,"great overall app with huge library of music. however, they should allow us to change our usernames, edit profile pic and playlist pic and description within the mobile app itself. allow us to know who is following our playlist so that we can discover similar music with people with similar music taste. music library is not exhaustive, several songs from well-known artists are not available."
131,Spotify,Hans-JÃ¸rgen Walvig,5,0,"After the last update I have to keep the screen on, otherwise the song stops after 30-60 seconds. Please fix asap....WRITTEN TWO DAYS LATER: SORRY, not your fault Spotify. I went to settings and made sure the app's not put to sleep when not in use."
132,Spotify,LINDSAY Robideau,3,1,I love spotify and being able to listen to whatever music I want. Since the new update though its continuously stopping my music for no reason. It's becoming quite frustrating that I can't just leave my phone to play music and have to remain close to it so I can't do other things
133,Spotify,Alex Acosta,4,0,"2016: I've only been using it for a week, but I'm loving it so far! EDIT 2019: Three years later and I'm still pretty happy. The only thing I wish is that we could still add shortcuts for playlists and albums to the homescreen."
134,Spotify,Weronika Badach,4,3,"Great app, but sadly 3 of the songs off of Eminem's encore album are unplayable, online and offline. The song titles appear greyed out and nothing plays when they are selected, though the versions on the censored album work fine (the songs are: ""love you more"" , ""we as Americans"" and ""Ricky ticky toc"")"
135,Spotify,Lin Yiu Yeung,3,9,"To whom it might be concern, I've been using spotify for almost one year, and the ads had never bothered me until recently an horror movie ad. I seriously don't think anyone will feel comfortable when they were enjoying their music one second before and get such scary ad a second after.... Please fix it"
136,Spotify,N A,5,0,"Spotify is the best! I don't think anyone has the music selection they have, and even the free version is has a fair amount of features, without having to ""watch"" two ads for every song. YouTube and iTunes wish they were this good."
137,Spotify,Ellie B,1,0,"I, most of the time, like Spotify. It's good for listening to music on the train and I use it almost every day. But one thing ruins it and I have to give it a 1 star. Premium. When I use a music streaming app, I expect basic features such as skipping multiple songs I don't like, making playlists with my own choice of songs and listening to podcasts in the CORRECT order and not in shuffle. But this is too much for Spotify to deliver so you must pay an outrageous Â£10 a month!!! Not worth it."
138,Spotify,Alejandra Sanchez,2,1,"after a couple of updates my spotify keep stops playing music when the screen turn off, I try differents configurations on my samsung galagy s9 but dosnt work. please help. I pay premiun and I really like the app when its works"
139,Spotify,Matt Brown,4,0,"I really enjoy the recommendation systems and the bundle deal with Hulu is also very nice. However I do not like losing access to some albums due to region locking, so I need to take a star off of a full five star review for that."
140,Spotify,Adam Woods,2,2,"Consistenly has bugs. After unlocking the app, previous menu doesnt load. Lock screen music control buttons dont work on the new samsung ui. Slow loading time. Bluetooth controls work 50% of the time. Occasionally bugs are fixed but then return in subsequent updates!"
141,Spotify,Tiffany Byram,3,1,I've used and loved Spotify Premium for quite a while now. Didn't seem to actually get Hulu but didn't persue it. Update meant no more landscape view which I can't have and will likely have to use a different app unless remedied.
142,Spotify,gavin kwi,4,0,"Spotify tends to not work right or at all when a new update comes out making you have to update it. It's going to be 4 stars because although you are the best music app there is, not having a premium spotify account can have obnoxious adds."
143,Spotify,Thushan senanayake,4,1,ok you guys somehow fixed my sd card glitch. Thanks for fixing it. Also can you please for the love of god make favourite albums and favourite songs separate. When I save my albums. It should only be saved on the Album section rather than messing up my songs library. Only my favourite songs should be saved on songs library. Please let this happen or at least let me search for a playlist when adding the song(s).
144,Spotify,Surya King,5,1,I have been using this app for a while now so here are some pros and cons pros:- 1. Good Suggestions 2. Good Audio Quality Cons 1. No Option To Loop The Song These Are The Things I Feel Will Update Soon
145,Spotify,Krishna Kumar,4,0,"Spotify has been great until very recent times. Don't get me wrong, the selection is still great. My issue is related to the player stopping during playback. It resumes after a few seconds most of the times. But it's nevertheless a great annoyance. Hope this issue will be resolved soon."
146,Spotify,miika17,2,0,The last two releases do not display the song titles through Bluetooth in the BMW 5-series iDrive (2015). I have tested three different Nokia Andoid phones. The older versions still work. Very annoying. Applications like YouTube do not have the same issue.
147,Spotify,Geo Gou,4,14,"Different song showing on widget, different or none on lock screen and different in the app, than what I hear. It's ridiculous So many bugs that even a junior developer would not make... Not to mention the app does not know when I'm online and cannot search for songs.. It's a shame of an app.. I'll stop paying and suggest people to use better alternatives"
148,Spotify,barry wakenshaw,1,0,Did you ever want to hear a dozen bad cover versions of the song you're looking for? This is the app for you! Like the functionality of every other media playing system since 1995? Too bad! This mess makes realplayer look futuristic.
149,Spotify,Nathon Webber,2,0,Spotify have listended and improved the user experience of the app and its load times however I can't change my startl rating yet. since the latest updateusic wont play properly on my galaxy s9 the audio keeps stopping now and against especially when the screen goes off. there isn't anything wrong with my internet connection and o haven't restricted the apps background data or put it to sleep.
150,Spotify,Daeng Merah,3,3,"Been using the app with no problem at all, however just recently updated the app, music stops randomly, and had to get back to the phone to get songs playing again. One song randomly stops 3-4 times. It's annoying. I'm a paying customer."
151,Spotify,John Hanken,5,188,"Spotify is like Oxygen! i know musicians have a hate/hate relationship, or many of them do, but I'd we can get the compensation model right, Spotify is what we have all been waiting for. i work so much, but know i can afford to discover new music from a time perspective. and I can share it! like Netflix, you'll have to pry it from my cold, dead fingers."
152,Spotify,Dara Rogers,1,1,I am a premium member. It's been working fine until recently. Now everytime I use it Spotify will stop playing unless I turn on my phone screen. Idk if this is because of the galaxy update ðŸ¤·ðŸ½â€â™€ï¸ but it's super annoying.
153,Spotify,Liyah Hilton,5,0,"I'll love it. You're able listen to any song or podcast at anytime and everywhere. It isn't slow even if your wifi is bad. Also you can hook it up to a speaker, computer, TV, phone, even a gaming console. In all I think it's a great app and thank you so much for making it a thing."
154,Spotify,Sean Reynolds,4,0,"Terrible with Android Pie, crashes all the time. Music stops playing, says songs are unavailable when they are in playlists... Needs work updated to 4 stars, by far my favorite music service and much better after recent update. lacking a star for not Including hulu with family plans."
155,Spotify,Lily Christenson,3,7,"It used to be so easy to filter a playlist, now I have to go thru several unneccessary steps to search for specific artists in my playlists. It used to be so easy, please bring back the swipe-down filter feature!! I notice it is still available in select staff curated playlists, so I cannot imagine why it was removed from user-created playlists. I use this feature alot and it is a major irrtiation when using the app nowadays, please fix!"
156,Spotify,Timothy Chua,1,2,"My offline downloaded songs has disappeared after I turn off and turn on my phone, mainly happen the Spotify data saved into internal storage before my phone detect SD card. Please resolve this immediately."
157,Spotify,Monika Light,3,2,The pc version of Spotify is great. But this is just dissapointing. And please PLEASE stop putting extra songs to my playlists it's extremely annoying. Maybe I want to litsen to some sad music and boom an extremely jumpy go lucky songs starts to play only because the person who made the sad song also made a really happy song. Its really REALLY annoying. And I've tried looking into the settings and found nothing. Please just give us the option to turn it off. Thank you
158,Spotify,Brett Slack,2,0,It worked good for about 1 week. Now it doesn't automatically start playing when I connect to my car. I have to open the app and click play. This is why I canceled my membership to the last company I used. I get in and out of my car about 20 or more time a day and it is nice to have it start playing automatically. Using Galaxy s10+
159,Spotify,pretty girls and cloud swirls,4,2,"The home screen has just disappeared??? Like, it's just blank but the rest of the app works completely fine? I think it was the newest update that messed it up but like, fix it. Music still works fine but I use the home screen a lot for daily mixes and such so please sort it."
160,Spotify,Christina Young,5,0,"I had pandora for years it is ok but I uninstalled it after installing spotify. I love it so much! I listen to a very wide selection of music and they have any song I want without listening to ""other artists like this"" if I choose. Wish I installed it sooner."
161,Spotify,Aspen,3,0,"The music volume gets louder and softer, and that's really annoying. I have the volume set at a certain percentage for a reason, not for an app to fluxuate because it damn well feels it wants to. Also, don't add songs to a playlist because you feel like it. I'll put what songs I want in my playlist, not you."
162,Spotify,Hope Show,1,0,love this app but recently has started randomly stopping in the middle of play. Its very annoying and I'm considering cancelling my premium service. UPDATE: Still cuts off randomly and really annoying as I'm paying for premium and not enjoying this.
163,Spotify,William Walden,2,0,Some one Hispanic hijacked my account for over a year and they could never fix it. no I'm not racist. The app would literally start playing that type of music through another phone.
164,Spotify,Jay Shaw,3,0,"Everything was smooth before since they updated it. Lock screen issue, can't skip songs from lock screen. tried uninstalling/reinstalling and everything that I could find online but nothing works please fix this otherwise I'll have to cancel my spotify membership."
165,Spotify,Eithan Schuler,4,0,Samsung watch remote control -- please bring back remote control so I can change the song while I'm at work. I dont have bluetooth headphones and Samsung watches dont have a lot of storage so this is really annoying. I want to be able to listen to music connected to my phone without taking my phone out of my pocket.
166,Spotify,Spencer Murphy,2,0,"Losing Faith Quickly Why is this program more and more buggy each day? Buttons on lock screen no longer work. Widget kills the program. My Samsung Watch can't connect. A year ago on my S8 this program was near flawless. Then one by one each feature began to fail. Now on a fresh install on a S10, newer watch (same series) and nothing works. Even the app randomly fails. Daily mixes stop playing after a couple songs. Repeatable on various networks, play lists, and even off-line listening."
167,Spotify,Leah Scheevel,2,1,"I have loved Spotify for years. Unfortunately, for the last 6 months or so, it will no longer function on my Samsung Galaxy. My connection is fine but nothing will load. It works fine on my computer. But won't play anything on my phone anymore. Very disappointed."
168,Spotify,Jason McKay,1,5,I'm being over charged for a family pack and no one can be bothered to answer my emails. very disappointed to see Â£15 lifted out of my bank account every month. you have also changed to the way I store my playlists. lately I have saved new music and it's no where to be found on my lists.
169,Spotify,Keyla Contreras,1,4,The new updates are alright but I HATE that you guys took out the search function in playlists. Before I could swipe down and search now I have to go to the Playlist menu and scroll down. Prefer it the way it uses to be.
170,Spotify,Christina Strouse,1,4,The app randomly stops playing songs when I'm listening and using other apps. Started about a week ago after some update you guys released. highly disappointing. been a spotify prem member since 2012. close to uninstalling until it gets fixed.
171,Spotify,jason vincent,4,13,"Would give 5 but current updates almost got me in a car wreck. for years ive been adding to the same playlists i created when i started and i knew exactly where each playlist was without looking. now playlist appear in order of most listened to, and i have to look to change my songs now if i want a different playlist. please add option to turn that off."
172,Spotify,Daniel Epling,1,0,"landscape mode gone?? I am a premium user, This was a 5 star app until last couple updates. why is landscape mode gone? I mirror this app from my galexy s8+ to my car and use the screen to control the app. now it is in Perminent vertical mode very hard to use on my touch screen while driving. So I have to pick up the phone and use it that way.Please fix this. thank you"
173,Spotify,k k,3,4,"ok i just have one problem with this. it would be nice if u would add like a player tab. where you can adjust stuff. like if you want to play the same song it play everything in the queue or just play one song and stop. with this version I can't even listen properly, I'll have to go and click play all the time after the song ends! so if you could add that option at least it would be nicer to use the app."
174,Spotify,benji,3,0,"i love this app! i even have the spotify premium subscription! but since the last update i keep getting this bug where the app will just, stop coming up in my toolbar or on my lockscreen. so i have to unlock my phone/navigate to the app to pause, play, and skip my songs, which can be kinda annoying when im busy jogging, walking my dog, working, etc. other than this bug, it's fine! pls fix soon i'm dying"
175,Spotify,Nathan Rice,1,0,I'm so tired of artists i hate coming up in my daily mixes and recent releases. I can't block them until they come up in the playlists and i don't always have the time to do more than skip. if they ever implement a feature to block artists I'll give 5 stars but until then I'm considering canceling my subscription.
176,Spotify,Amber K,2,0,"This used to be my favorite music radio app, not anymore. The music keeps stopping as soon as my screen times out. I've updated twice since it started, and nothing has changed. Please fix"
177,Spotify,Alec McElroy,2,0,"The most recent update makes it almost unusable on my phone. The moment the screen times out, the music stops playing, and I'm unable to find a fix in the settings. I never had this problem before. As a paying member, I'm not happy at all"
178,Spotify,Calum Mackintosh,5,3,Smashing! A great application which offers a wide variety whatever your listening pleasure. The premium is tops and best to go with. I have found the amount charged on a monthly basis affordable even for someone like me on a prudent budget. I could not do without it now.
179,Spotify,Katie Heffner,2,0,Used to be my favorite streaming app. Now I can barely listen to anything without it freaking out. Pauses between songs/podcast episodes and I have to open the app to make it play again. Pauses in the middle of streaming and I have to completely close out of the app for it to start playing again. There's been a couple updates since this started and still no fixes. Would easily get 5 starts if this was ever finally addressed.
180,Spotify,Christina humphrey,4,0,"I love Spotify, it is my go to music app. i love how easy it is to find songs I love, and discover new songs. My only issue is, the six skips per hour, that just doesn't seem like enough for someone not paying for Premium, maybe raise it to 10? Per playlist/station. Overall a great app though."
181,Spotify,Dreaming Days,2,1,This app was great until I got a Samsung Galaxy S9. Now the app pops up as a bubble for the app and another bubble for whatever song is playing (annoying). It also randomly just stops playing often now. Seriously considering cancelling my membership and going back to Pandora. I want to be able to get rid of the bubble and still play music. Pandora didnt do this weird thing where it stops often either.
182,Spotify,Alexa Mara,3,0,"Please enable hands free fast forward for podcasts. I just switched from an iPhone and whenever I listened to Podcasts in the car, I would use the forward button (on my car radio) to fast forward or rewind 15 seconds. With android this is not possible; when I press forward, it changes the podcast I'm playing! This bug is so dangerous because now when I drive and listen to a Podcast I need to navigate to the button on the app to f forward or rewind. Please, please fix!"
183,Spotify,David Stephenson,2,0,"Since the last update I can no longer access my liked songs by Artist, album etc... The app doesn't show songs liked, in an easy and findable way if I haven't downloaded the whole album. Basically the way the music library now works is terrible. Go back to how it used to work."
184,Spotify,Joe Leon,5,1,"Fantastic music app, love being able to listen to basically anything I want. Can't fault it at the minute, not encountering any bugs or problems. I'd maybe like it to be more customisable, and easier to add songs to different playlists and create playlists."
185,Spotify,Lucas Vanvoorden,4,1,"A must have app. Listen to all your albums ( vinyl or cd) - or discover new music and take them with you in Premium. Type in a song and float away on similar music. A few minor flaws though, occasionally some tracks are grayed out for no apparent reason and can't be played. Also in order to connect to my Chromecast Audio I need to pass via my cellphone."
186,Spotify,David Sanchez,1,0,"the app was great until today. the app started acting glitchy. everytime I pressed a button (play, pause, a different song, home key, ANYTHING!) the music stop for a split second. its annoying. I pay for the service and it has bugs. I don't know what to do. I haven't changed any settings."
187,Spotify,Paul Kubajak,3,0,"I like how Spotify chooses music. And the more you give it feedback, the better it gets. However, the options to ""like"" or ""dislike"" a song doesn't show up when playing through a lot of devices, most importantly, a car stereo. I had the buttons when I played it on a Kenwood stereo through Apple Carplay, but not on Android Auto. And on a Subaru stock stereo, those options don't show up for either phone. If I play my account through my smart tv, I can't like or dislike a song there either."
188,Spotify,Noah Baxter,2,4,When can I block artists from playlists and radio options on Android? I never want to hear Drab Majesty again. Oh and I see uou messed with the UI again and it SUCKS. AGAIN. LEAVE IT ALONE. WHERE DID MY RECENTLY PLAYED GO? L A M E
189,Spotify,tbh,1,7,"Give us back our personalized radio stations!! I can't create a radio station anymore, and I can't add any stations to my stations tab. Now, whenever I come across a new station, it shows as a playlist that I can follow. I don't want another playlist. I want a radio station that changes as I rate the songs. Just like it used to be. This is ridiculous!"
190,Spotify,Alvin Chitena,1,33,"Samsung S10+: After the Android Pi update, Spotify is now bad. Lock screen music controls don't work at all. The music player widget controls lag sometimes. The app is just buggy overall. It seems like the Android team wasn't fully ready for Android Pi. As a paying customer, I expect better."
191,Spotify,Ljubica Prusac,4,0,"I love Spotify but what is missing for the fifth star is audio books in the language that I select. I live in Germany but unfortunately I'm not a fluent German speaker so I'm using the app in English, however, the content that I'm provided is still in German and without option to be changed to another language. There is no obvious reason for things to be that way, especially for premium users."
192,Spotify,Gadsden Rothbard,5,0,"Glitch with saving downloaded songs to SD Card. THIS ISSUE WAS FIXED WITH THE NEW UPDATE. KUDOS, SPOTIFY. GOOD, GOOD. THANKS. 5 STARS. WORTH THE MONEY. pandora still has the next music selection, but that's ok, both apps complement each other nicely"
193,Spotify,LeoLaredo,5,11,"Love the app! It's my daily music player. And upgrading to premium was totally worth it! But the only thing I do not like, is the widget. Whenever I want to play/pause/skip a song on the widget it pauses my music, making me have to open the app itself and resume my music. It gets annoying sometimes. Would love to keep using the widget, so please look into this minor bug. Thank you for reading!"
194,Spotify,Common Sense-Zen,2,10,"Dont see what all the hype is about would've expected it to be more clean and not as cluttered it has so much going on dont even know where to start. one thing I dont like is that you can only ""like"" a song but you cant dislike to not hear that song anymore. shouldn't it be tuning it to your own taste and not just forcing songs on you? I would like to see a more refined version."
195,Spotify,Charles Deveau,1,0,Deleted the app the first second it decided to play whatever it wanted without my permission. may as well just put your own music on your phone if you don't have premium
196,Spotify,Muffbedazzled piggy,2,0,better than pandora and iheart but that's not saying much. I have over 200 songs in one playlist (but more playlists) which is awesome but no choice but to shuffle play. Not only that everytime I get an ad the same exact songs get played after. I don't have any that are loved and can't fix in settings. bout to uninstall just for this reason.
197,Spotify,Chad mindy,2,0,annoying f!@king ads way to frequently. especially the spotify ad itself plays back to back when your right in the middle of a good workout. it's like everything else they will annoy you till you pay.
198,Spotify,Drew James,2,1,Shuffle play should shuffle the songs completely randomly. Not some specific order. App should remember where I last played in the Playlist so I won't start again. There was a problem also of crashing when phone is in sleep. Music just stops. Skipping is delayed. You press skip several times thinking there was a problem. But there you go you spent your free 6 skips.
199,Spotify,Grayyylmao TM,1,0,The app would play 2 songs and stop after that and id have to restart the whole thing just to get another 2 songs. I pay for premium because this app used to be good but for the past month this has been happening
200,Spotify,V Mang,1,2,STILL HATE the update App keeps failing Search is wack. Was once able to like songs from a station now i have to add them? I dont want to pull over and select or create a playlist for EVERY song. I want to like it and hear it later on my for you list. I hate to see developers justify job security w stupid a!! SLIGHT changes! just FIX it and work on somethin ELSE/ UPDATED again; app keeps crashing!
201,Spotify,Sjur Svenning,2,3,"Tge drake spam was too much for me. Additionally developers have been removing or moving functionality buttons in the app that me and many others have loved. Other annoying changes have been made. Usually a dependable app. Spotify is basically an institution in my life and I'd give the app 4 stars if it wasn't for the drake spam, that happened last year."
202,Spotify,Fallen Reaper,4,3,I give it a 4-star because the app sometimes shuts off while I'm trying to do other apps and that's really annoying when I have to go back and then hit play all over again. Aside from that is a pretty decent app. enjoy listening to music while I play games and so far when this app works it's ideal for what I need. enjoy the music is free and it has a wide range a has a wide range of choices. It is ideal for anyone who is looking for something different that doesn't cost an arm or a leg.
203,Spotify,Wolf Girl,3,0,"please stop adding songs to the playlists I make. It's really annoying. and please have the option to just listen to the song rather than having shuffle play. have both idc, just let us be able to listen to a song."
204,Spotify,Jim Lahey,3,0,Not a fan of the button placement for casting to another device. It was fine in the middle where it was. Also having to press on the band name to go to there page isn't the best. Again getting a little list to go to that particular album etc was much better. Please take on board
205,Spotify,Hannah Le Fondre,3,0,"This app use to be great but I updated my payment method and now the app wont even load, all I get when i open is a black screen for 2-5 seconds then taken back to my home screen. This is ver annoying especially when I'm paying premium for this app. Please fix ASAP!!!"
206,Spotify,Jeff Simpson,3,0,"Not liking the new interface. I can't find anything now... Seems like my artist view is ""curated"" or something. Where did all songs go, etc? Been a subscriber for years but now looking at alternatives."
207,Spotify,Kenneth Roussell,3,1,"Update 2: Had to lower my rating from 5 stars to 3. Still love the music, layout, control etc. My problem is storage. When I restart my phone the app changes my storage preference from SD to Internal Storage, starts downloading songs I have previously downloaded. Fix the storage problem and the 5 stars return."
208,Spotify,Jonathan M,1,4,"Super duper, eurodance! UPDATE: REDUCED TO 3 STARS: the app freezes so much, constantly either waiting for it to respond or closing the app. I will delete this soon if it continues for much longer. UPDATE: REDUCED TO 1 STAR. Freezes with one button press, android notification that tells me spotify is running wont go away, android notification that Spotify is using battery wont go away, freezes and crashes if you try to use any functions of the app, it behaves like a VIRUS, uninstalled."
209,Spotify,A Google user,1,1,"when i create playlists itdoes a terrible job shuffling songs, it plays thesame songs by the same bands on the ones i create, and what is the deal ofyou having tohave premium just to download songs? deezer is better. on Spotify i can'tscroll down andit says it's not responding when i haveperfect internet. wthell THANKS ALL YOU LIARS, THIS APP IS A DISCRACE AND I'M TIRED OF IT SAYING IT ISN'T RESPONDING, whydoes my music stop after advertisement, BEST MUSIC APP, HA!!ðŸ˜¡ YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED F*** U"
210,Spotify,Lily Ferguson,2,43,"I've had spotify free services for years now. I did a trial at one time. My suggestion is that if you want me to want to pay for the services, it's gotta stop glitching. In my car, and with my bluetooth at work, which are the main times that I use it, the app will play a song, and then not go to the next. I have to open my phone and pause and play or close out the app and reopen it to get it to work again. it's aggravating in both situations. Often I have to wait till I'm stopped in my car to fix"
211,Spotify,Casey Cox,3,0,"Usually Spotify is pretty good, but since the last update it stops randomly until I unlock my phone and push the play button again. If this doesn't get fixed soon, I'm definitely cancelling my subscription."
212,Spotify,Sarah Mihuc,2,123,"Not happy with the new update, as it has made the app much harder to use without providing anything new. I would rather have a library of songs which I can browse by artist, album, etc. than just a ""liked"" playlist. If I wanted to only listen to playlists I would just use the free version of Spotify. Also, you removed the ability to see how many songs are in a playlist, which I used frequently when it was there. Lastly, it's harder to access and manage my downloaded songs now than it was before."
213,Spotify,Jonathan James,4,0,Good service as I've been using it for about 6 years now. Only thing I find difficult is the certain songs from other parts of the world are faded out. I understand that some songs aren't released over in the UK. But if Spotify are already paying for licence on the tracks to artists I find it confusing as to why this still happens.
214,Spotify,Benjamin Jones,2,0,"Due to recent update, causes app to redownload song data to internal hard drive instead of external, which was designated by the user. this causes the app to crash and possibly tour device. strongly suggest not downloading until this is corrected."
215,Spotify,Daniel Buch,2,5,"I like spotify's service but the app has lately become terrible. It's slow when it doesn't need to be (e.g. loading offline playlists when on a weak internet connection), generally laggy (e.g. on startup, when showing the three-dot context menu). The interface has constantly become less intuitive, e.g. the queue is no longer directly accessible from the current track screen. The playlist search that has been moved to a context menu. All this used to be better in an earlier version - but WHY??"
216,Spotify,Temi T,2,0,"App keeps stopping when a song is playing, and I will have to go back into the app and press play, but then it starts the track over. Very frustrating, especially when trying to entertain guest"
217,Spotify,Tracey DeLos Santos,4,7,"Loving the app. Just a couple issues though: I wish it'd let me change the theme color. I've gotten used to the black, but sometimes it bothers my eyes, makes it harder to see in daylight when I don't wanna turn my screen brightness. Also, there are plenty of songs I couldn't listen to. I find artists and albums there that oftentimes have some, or even all of the songs unplayable...just gray."
218,Spotify,Gabagooosh,1,0,The redesign to the UI is absolutely awful. No longer can single songs be added for them to show up to in your library. The entire album now needs to be added. Now there are plenty of songs in my library I don't intend on listening to. It's a cluttered mess.
219,Spotify,Kevin Shin,5,4,"Fantastic app for listening on the go. I personally do not know any of the popular music and I often feel left out not knowing what songs everyone else listens to. However, spotify has their own playlists that you can even download for offline use (with premium). I use this app daily, while on the bus, at home or even at school. Would rate 6 stars if I could."
220,Spotify,Elena Conner,2,1,"Quite disappointing bugged updates recently : 1. Can't stop or fast forward a song from a locked screen ; 2. Complete bs about commercials- they repeat themselves even after ""30 minutes of uninterrupted listening"" and repeat the commercials few times in a row 3. Visual commercials block an option of going back to a list of songs in a playlist. Started looking for a replacement app"
221,Spotify,Dana Messeguer,5,0,"It's a really convenient and very easy to use app for music and/or podcast lovers. I really appreciate that you're able to download podcast tracks even if you're not premium. The only kind of let down for the free version is the amount of repetitive commercials about premium features, but even those can be handled in a somewhat friendly way."
222,Spotify,Rayan Chellali,1,0,Horrible. You cant skip songs you have to pay for some bloody Spotify platinum plus they add some random songs to ur playlist sorry but ist a delete for me
223,Spotify,Kayla Fairfield,3,0,The shuffle option on playlists is awful. It shuffles but still in relative order of the playlist. So if your playlist is long then prepare to never hear 75% of the songs
224,Spotify,ZX Ho,4,5,"For the This Is:Twice spotify playlist, it writes that there are 27 songs in the playlist but Im only able to play 5 of them. On my tablet, I can see the rest of the songs but Im unable to play them, on my phone, Im unable to see those songs and unable to play it.. even tho the playlist writes that there are 27 songs and I expect to be able to play all 27 songs.."
225,Spotify,A Google user,3,0,Why would you take out raidio based on playlist? I used to get new music recommendations based on my taste. featured music on Spotify is so not my taste. Pandora is somehow better at finding new songs i like then add them to my playlist on Spotify.
226,Spotify,sophie arnold,1,676,"I don't know what the bloody hell you've done, but I can't even log in to my Spotify account. I put in my login details and it goes blank and returns to the login screen! Not happy at all, I'll give it until the weekend and then I'll cancel my subscription. No point keeping something that no longer works. Honestly there was nothing wrong with it before, why fix something that ain't broke!"
227,Spotify,place holdef,1,0,"Hate it. it won't let me chose the song I want in my playlist,I click the 'more' button but when a click a song on it it gives me the stupid preview part. worst app I've downloaded and a waste of space"
228,Spotify,Amanda Maclean,1,0,"App is stopping randomly during song play. It now will not allow you to control the music play from your lock screen on your phone or via bluetooth in your car. please fix this, I have tried all recommended fixes and nothing has changed."
229,Spotify,disappointment as a form,3,0,"I really like the app, and it's great for finding music I want to listen to. But i hate that I can't even get skips back after using them up. It's just annoying to me.."
230,Spotify,JonatÃ¡n RÅ‘thi,5,0,"The Android app is getting worse and worse. Sometimes it deletes my downloaded music library, sometimes it says I'm offline even though I'm connected to WiFi or mobile data. Loading screens everywhere. I'm considering switching to another premium music service if this keeps going on. Edit: since my review they fixed up almost everything. Great new layout too."
231,Spotify,Jackie,1,0,"This new update us horrible! Spotify used to be great! Now it crashes, will not go to the next song, takes the longest to bring up an artist! go back 2 the old version or i may just cancel my subscription!!! ðŸ˜¡"
232,Spotify,Ramzesso Marconi,1,12,"Scammers They promised 6 months of free music, if I buy Samsung S10+ . After 1 month they disconnected and said. ""Upon checking, since the 6 months offer did not show up on your device when you checked on the Premium tab, I'm afraid that the offer is per device and had been used already. It seems that you've already taken advantage of a 30 day trial on March 11."" Meaning, you had a Premium subscription before. Unfortunately, that means youâ€™re ineligible for this offer."
233,Spotify,G,1,0,Since last update I have lost Bluetooth connection to head unit. When checking online this seems to be a common issue. Was happy before but won't continue with premium service if not resolved shortly
234,Spotify,Hunter Henson,2,0,was good. now it's a pain. every 10 damn minutes the app crashed when I'm playing music. it's really getting to the point I'm about to unsubscribe unless you fix this issue. android os. most recent on galaxy s9
235,Spotify,Sam Arbon,2,0,The description misleads you into believing you can download and play music offline for free using this app. unfortunately that is too good to be true. uninstalled as the description is misleading and there are other free methods! Otherwise the app seems decent. shame they feel the need to dupe people into downloading though. my review reflects this disappointment
236,Spotify,boost323_ _,2,0,"update sucks, 2 stars simple because of this last update. offline mode I can't access all my liked songs, and will only play the same song, I literally have to go in and manually change to the next song (no repeat is not on). recieving phone calls my music will not stop now either, also have to go in and manually stop the song. lastly the new layout sucks!"
237,Spotify,Joshua Bennett,1,31,"So not that anyone seems to read these, the app still doesn't auto connect to my cars bluetooth like it used to. And even when I'm in the app itself, it just stops everything at random moments!!! Please get your shiz together and give me my spotify app back!!!!!"
238,Spotify,Joseph Haslam,2,0,there is this bug where when I go to see what's new at the home nothing appears and I've restarted my phone twice. maybe it's the update that screwed it up I like the app but ya know it's still kinda buggy
239,Spotify,Jake Hopkins,1,1,"I loved this app before this most recent update. I absolutely loathe how artists are only followed now rather than having individual songs saved. I do not like having to navigate the artists' page everytime I have one song stuck in my head or typing it out to search for it (especially when I can't remember the song name). Sure, all of my saved songs are in the ""Liked"" Playlist, but that is even more inconvenient since you can only sort Alphabetically and by 'Recently Added'."
240,Spotify,Khalid Shaaili,1,27,"I love and enjoy all the ways to explore and find music. I also love that this update added the artists at least that i have added (saved) songs from in the 'your music' section. I just wish that I can see the same implementation under albums. Plus, if there's a section on the artists page that houses the songs that I liked (saved) from them. This app is not really that good at browsing your own saved music (that you pay a subscription to keep). The desktop app though, is PERFECTION!"
241,Spotify,Rafael Segnini,4,0,"You got to love the new bugs on the latest releases of the app! Are you listening to a good song but you want to go forward to the next without unlocking your phone? The automatic lock screen widget provided by the app will surely give you a headache, since it doesn't work anymore. You press the forward and nothing happens. Cool! Now, if you're listening a playlist of your own, certain songs will start from the middle and sometimes will reset the shuffle. It's like a Russian roulette - exciting! If you're connected via Bluetooth, sometimes a play from the widget won't work either... so...   But, you know, it's still the best app for streaming music. Music variety is virtually infinite, so give it a shot."
242,Spotify,Pravin Pratap,4,0,"The only thing wrong with the app is the fact that a lot of songs are unavailable in India, and that the sound engine lowers the volume considerably. Other than that, it's the best music app ever!"
243,Spotify,Piketchup,1,33,"This app has so much locked behind a paywall nowadays. The free version of Spotify is now missing a lot of basic music player functions, especially for mobile users. Skipping songs is nearly exclusive to Premium. Playing a playlist straight through without shuffle is now only a Premium feature. The ads for Premium are annoying as well, basically dangling over the user's head they don't have a feature. Not everyone wants to pay the $10/mo for Premium. Please stop trying to make it mandatory."
244,Spotify,YaÄŸmur Oymak,4,0,"Occasionally my downloads disappear. When that happens, settings do not show storage in the device (shows only an empty bar). I have to delete all data to work around the bug. So I have to redownload everything again. Used to work flawlessly."
245,Spotify,Geordon Worley,1,0,"Spotify removed its most useful feature: custom radios. Now when you play a radio, you cannot remove songs from the radio if they are in your library because the heart button is selected. They also play songs based on your library and the playlist a radio is based on, not just the playlist. This means if you want to listen to a new kind of music, you can't, it just wont let you. I was loyal to Spotify for 4 years. Beware, spotify is no longer useful for finding new music. Just use Pandora."
246,Spotify,Carly Pratt,1,1,"Use to absolutely love this app, for the past few months every time my phone (galaxy s9+) lock screens the music will randomly pause and then take about 10 seconds to replay, unless I unlock my phone. Which is annoying while driving and trying to listen to my music without interruption. Was hoping it would be fixed in the new update but it's still happening. Very close to cancelling my premium subscription. Have tried uninstalling and reinstalling to no avail."
247,Spotify,dane heinemann,1,0,i love this app however since the last update the songs will stop playing. i have to go into my phone and press play. after awhile it will stop playing again. i am a paying customer please can you fix this problem?
248,Spotify,Sam Russell,1,64,"Been a month now, app is still horrible, it looked like they tried to fix it once and it helped the skip/rewind functions a bit, but now they updated it so it's broken again. Functionality from the lock screen is completely gone so that needs to be fixed. They need to bring back the ability to sort your library by artist and album, it was everyone's favorite feature, its bizarre that Spotify decided to get rid of it, don't they know why people use this app? To *easily* store/retrieve music."
249,Spotify,Elsa Gonzalez,2,1,"the app doesnt crash ONLY if you listen to music you've downloaded. Any other music makes the app crash after 30 seconds. even if you leave the app and your screen open, it crashes"
250,Spotify,Beast Gaming,4,6,I'll be listening to music while my screen is off and it just stops. turning my phone to the lock screen fixes it and then it stops when my screen goes off for a while. deleting then reinstalling helps for a few days. but it returns to its state of uselessness. I would love a more permanent solution. app used to work.
251,Spotify,Daniel Jaeger,1,293,"Worse monetization than EA. Constantly bombarding you with popups and paywalls. You can only skip 6 songs for free before they make you pay for the privelage of hitting the next button. And probably the worst and most infuriating thing about it. on the PC and PS4, it's absolutely fine, it works perfectly, just as well as everything else without needing to gouge my wallet."
252,Spotify,Nichol Davids,3,0,"The most annoying thing selecting ""available devices"" from your phone! It gives you the tutorial of how to rather than making the option available to you to select the device from your phone! Kinda pointless to go back to pc to select device!!!"
253,Spotify,Krystyna Dixon,5,0,"I absolutely love this app! I use to have Pandora, they messed up my downloads & we're too hard to work with & never fixed it. I got Spotify & haven't looked back."
254,Spotify,doge meme,1,0,"there is a bug when you listen to radio you can't click on anything or the app crashes. it's higly inconvenient please fix it.

255,Spotify,Prerna Pradhan,5,0,"I really really loved this app a lot..I'm a free user.but I do plan on getting premium when I start earning my own money..but being a free user is also very very good ,not all the app provides this not the ones I've tried yet. But there is one thing that I would really request spotify to think and that is to add one thing - lyrics, anyone would love to have lyrics in app itself rather than googling the lyrics and then snapshoting and all. I hope Spotify would take a look on that. thank you ðŸ˜Š"
256,Spotify,Mayur Jagtap,5,0,"Tough competition for indian competitors now. One of best music app Pros: Best app to discover new music or artist. This Gaana and Saavan app too have big music library, but discovering your type of music is very difficult on those app. but I don't know how, but next song suggestion by Spotify matches my choice. great app. â¤ï¸ from India.."
257,Spotify,Marcel Whitehead Tyson,5,0,This is the BEST MUSIC APP OF ALL TIME!!! I canceled iMusic for this app. I love the daily mixes the most. Every morning Spotify puts the songs you've downloaded in a daily mix with other songs you haven't downloaded but are similar or in the same realm. New artist and songs discovered EVERYDAY!!!
258,Spotify,bbyhobi _,4,0,"this app is a really good way to listen to music for free and by not using a ton of my data, but sometimes the songs will just pause in the middle of it or befotr it even starts playing. it gets annotong really fast."
259,Spotify,Yati Chauhan,5,0,What a Wonderful App ...Evry song and Evry artist is just a click away ...Best part is we can share our playlist with our friend without even bothering that we will miss any song while sharing it. I would like to experience the premium version too but thats not affordable .
260,Spotify,megan muller,4,1,Love the app but have a few improvements for the app to make it the best music app on play store. I suggest that you should scrap the whole six skips per hour thing as this is just stupid because people might not be in the mood for certain songs. You should also allow people to download songs so they can listen offline and not always use data or wifi. And the final improvement is that you should allow people to listen to the songs that they tap on because they may only want to listen to them.
261,Spotify,Joshua Chicoine,2,0,playlist pauses after every song. I have to go in and manually press pause then play to start again. which is so annoying that I want to use a different service. I would have given 1 star but spotify use to be good
262,Spotify,Spencer Moore,3,0,"I've been using Spotify for years, always been five stars. The most recent upgrade appears to have partially disabled forward and reverse controls from my Bluetooth device. Any chance of fixing that?"
263,Spotify,Lou Cashews,1,1,"why can't i just listen to to song I want to listen to? that's horrible! fix the issue, please. it makes this app frustrating. and why does it add other music that you don't like? geez..."
264,Spotify,Thabang Lekgetho,3,0,"The app and service are amazing, no doubt, I love that indie and alternative artists that i like get to shine. But I hate that you guys are lacking some mainstream albums, like Dr Dre's Compton, and Jay-Z's 4:44, to nane a few. Please add them, 'cause im kinda considering changing to google music because of this."
265,Spotify,A Google user,3,1,"Spotify is an awesome service. The app works fine in general but crashes very often when I'm downloading big playlists for offline usage. It goes back to the home screen and I have to restart the app to continue downloading. Please look into this issue as I have lots of storage on my phone that I would like to fill with lots of offline music. Due to this issue I'm giving this app 3 stars, if Spotify fixes the continuous crashing then I will gladly give this app 5 stars."
266,Spotify,"Steven Michael Anderson, MBA",4,1,"Great app, access to much music, and good value for the Premium membership. Less one star because as of the latest update, I cannot clear the queue. As my mood changes i like to be able to clear out those tunes I lined up prior. Speaking of queues, it sure would be keen to be able to save a queue as a playlist. So there are two options for devs, should they choose to pursue."
267,Spotify,Michael Wolf,1,0,"I'm premium user I like the music available, but the GUI is absolutely horrible and gets more complicated with evey update. Motto: KEEP IT SIMPLE"
268,Spotify,Fiona Okeefe,1,1,"If your looking for free music, i wouldn't recommend this. When you make a playlist without premium, it just adds about 20 random songs which you cannot remove. Also without premium, you cannot shuffle play. This is a very annoying app."
269,Spotify,Bryan Unrau,3,0,"Really like the app and would recommend it to anyone who likes music and podcasts. One thing that would make it better, please bring back the ability to go into landscape when the device is on its side while on the currently playing page. It had done this at one point and it was nice, and either the last update or the one before took it away."
270,Spotify,Josh the Happy,4,0,"Notification WILL NOT go away. This app keeps showing as if it is running taking up space in my notifications. It comes right back a few minutes after clearing it or closing the app. I see many people have this same problem how can such a premium app have this issue ongoing for so many people? No trouble shooting steps have cleared tbis issue from my device, I'm thinking of going back to Pandora."
271,Spotify,Robin Nelson,2,3,"4/22/19... Spotify, y'all messing w/me. Why can't I play music from an ENTIRE album, instead of going back to what was playing prior after 1 song. It's been doing this for several days and I dont like it. I pay for this, I'm not getting it free, so I expect better. You all need to fix this mess 3/12/19...whatever you guys did with this new update, ughhh... now my equalizers (incl. Dolby) aren't working with it. Why? Why? Aren't updates supposed to improve a user's experience, not frustrate it."
272,Spotify,Robert Cox,1,4,"This latest update broke the app and is unintuitive. Spotify running in the background causes my phone to slow down now when it didn't before the update, there a noticeable delay when switching between apps and opening music. If I try to pause or play spotify from the pulldown menu it doesn't register until i open the app and then it typically plays and pauses the music a couple times because I tried to hit the button a couple times, the same thing happens when I'm using my Bose wireless earbuds"
273,Spotify,Calean Sixes,1,1,"So many friggin ads it's gotten ridiculous. You have 6 skips per hour xD You are forced to watch 3 minutes of ads every 30 minutes. You have to pay for everything it's NOT a free music streaming app. Having to pay to do basic functions is Hilarious, hence why I download music instead."
274,Spotify,Piyush Kohli,1,0,"ã€‹A lot of good music is missing from their catalog. ã€‹The app is not stable, they keep changing the design with every update. ã€‹Toggling a setting don't seem to work at all. ã€‹I have disabled lyrics but they still show up. ã€‹I have enabled download via cellular yet it always takes a wifi connection to download newly added songs to library."
275,Spotify,Jeremy Norton,2,2,"Used to be my favorite app. Ever since the beginning off this month,I have had nothing but headaches from this. - stops playback on my phone every third song and randomly skips songs and has start up issues on my tv."
276,Spotify,Aiden Dutton,4,2,"I only have two issues with Spotify; one being that some songs are only available in specific countries (Theres some Japanese songs Id like to listen to which are only available in Japan), and the other being that it doesnt have every artist I like, or it has only 2 of their many songs (im referring to Goatbed). Other than that, very good streaming service."
277,Spotify,Dr Sunny B,2,0,"premium price for a small library. I love the feature of spotify recommendations hence the 2 stars. but without my complete library , I cannot recommend Spotify to anyone .They should have sorted out the nonsense with Warner before releasing in India. more than half of my favourite tracks aren't there. Although I hate apple music interface , I'm forced to stick to it because YT music is garbage"
278,Spotify,Paul Farrell,1,0,"This app is rubbish. Don't get me wrong, I like Spotify just not the app. How can they get it so wrong, a five year old could design a more user friendly app. Too much wrong to describe. As a majour international entity Spotify should be a leader in app development but instead we get rubbish. You can have all the content in the world but it's pointless if customers can't easily access it."
279,Spotify,A Google user,1,0,"Was good. Lost all my downloads while travelling. And ""help"" did not help at all to look for causes. From googling I noticed it's a very common problem that Spotify does nothing about."
280,Spotify,Nishan Panag,1,0,"Newest UI update completely ruined this app for me. I now can't shuffle through all my played songs without manually going through each album and ""liking"" each song first. No idea why anybody thought this was a good direction for the app"
281,Spotify,Jantina 99,5,0,"I love my spotify, but for the last couple of days it will cut out. I have to keep the app plus my phone on and open for the music to play, and as soon as my phone goes into rest mode the music stops. please fix it!!!ðŸ˜Š"
282,Spotify,Jonathan De Los Santos,1,9,After the last two updated the app its getting worse... As soon as I block my phone the song stop playing! And I cannot control properly the music properly from my headphones and even from the phone! FIX IT! So F**King annoying... I can't listen anything... This is a really shame
283,Spotify,Elisa Araujo,1,16,"I'm a premium user and I have just switched from an iPhone to a Galaxy S9 (obviously both really good cell phones). However, since I switchedy phone EVERY SINGLE TIME the phone screen blocks the song stops playing. What's the use of the app if I can't put on a song and let it play on a Playlist if I have to unlock the phone every 2 minutes? It's in fact really annoying and imagine the amount of battery it spends... It has to be fixed!!"
284,Spotify,Mizzy Fizzle,3,0,I love being able to create my own playlists and download them.so they can be played offline. I have noticed though that the music quality is not as good as it was. At the moment it's like having a dodgy discman. The music skips a lot which is annoying. I thought it might have been my old phone (S5) that was the issue but I have recently updated to an S9 and I'm still having issues.
285,Spotify,jose pagan,3,0,It's been rough lately. Music stops randomly and landscape and portrait views are not working. I love the app but I'm having issues on my note 9 which I don't think I should be having seeing they partnered up. I was not having these issues before pie update. Hope it gets fixed soon.
286,Spotify,Kaileigh Lowry,2,0,GET PANDORA! I'm tired of spotify adding songs to my playlists and it playing songs that aren't on my playlists before it's even over. It's extremely annoying and there's nothing in the settings to turn it off. Please add the option to turn that off on the free version or stop it alltogether. I don't see why I should have to pay to be able to listen to a playlist without any extra songs. This is why I deleted it in the 1st place. I downloaded it again to give it another chance and it's failed.ðŸ˜¡
287,Spotify,Gayatri Kapur,5,0,amazing daily playlists... takes away tge need of flippinh songs and jolting ones own memory go figure out what to play next! its almost as if they exactly know your taste and whats on your mind next! also very well optimized for low network speeds. super job guys!
288,Spotify,Avalon Morris,1,0,"Randomly stops playing now? Considering I pay for premium, that's Super helpful for when I'm driving to work and it only plays 2 songs. Will give 5 stars again when this issues is fixed."
289,Spotify,Marlene Bell,5,12,Being using Spotify for like 5 years. Love the Home Page. It has good similar stuff based on my pass listening experiences etc. Great alogrithims. Spotify is like having my very own personal DJ or its likes having a certain special person who knows exactly my music taste and what I mostly likely to listen to and they are manually creating I mean putting together stuff on here for me listen to like albums etc eventhough it all just alogrithims mostly. But l enjoy this service alot.
290,Spotify,Valerie Rivera,3,2,Ever since I installed the last update my music does not continue to play. If phone locks music stops completely and I have to unlock screen in order for the music to play. I also can't pause or forward when the screen is lock. I did not have this issue prior to the update. this is so annoying
291,Spotify,Ryan Loftus,1,0,good luck trying to pair this with a Samsung watch. it requires you to pay for the upgraded $10 month version which is a total joke! deleting this app right now and will never use it again
292,Spotify,{TxX} reVoltzZ,1,0,"Really bad, thought it was good but you have to shuffle play 20 songs to get the song you want. Im not willing to pay 20$ for spotify premium just to listen to 3 songs i like , dont reccomend in fact, i reccomend SoundCloud. PLEASE MAKE SPOTIFY BETTER. i hate to say it but its true..."
293,Spotify,Paige Snow,1,0,The update is horrible. I have premium and now it doesn't come up with the download option. It won't let you listen to a whole somg it will only let you listen to previews.
294,Spotify,Shawn Winowski,5,0,I have a playlist od 9 songs and spotify needs to add 3 unwanted songs that i dont want to listen. Can i listen to my playlist without added trash?
295,Spotify,Sherica Sutton,5,0,"I love spotify, especially spotify premium. What I don't like is when you don't pay for premium u can only play random songs. I have a lot of songs in one playlist. Out of 100 songs the same 10 songs will play. So very annoying. Please fix this. Other than that I love it. Also I cant find a few artists. I have to go elsewhere to find some unpopular artists. Overall, love the app and now Hulu is a feature. Not a fan of Hulu but its free with my subscription so why not."
296,Spotify,Somak Bhattacharya,1,0,"why the hell can't I access my songs on the mobile app?!? The whole point of Spotify is to save and play songs! Completely unacceptable especially considering the monthly rate. The UI's pretty but kinda sucks too. For example, the click range for a song's menu is tiny. If I have a queue and miss the menu dots, the song plays and the whole queue gets wiped out!"
297,Spotify,Vic Val,3,0,"Ads play louder than music, which is super annoying. Sometimes starts playing music from a totally different playlist. sometimes shuffle play works and sometimes there's no option to shuffle. All these annoying things seem to exist to push people to the paid platform."
298,Spotify,Benjamin Little,1,7,"I find this app invaluable, and a month ago would have rated 5 star. But not as it currently is! Over the last month, the app consistently stops playing a song, after my phones screen has timed out. As soon as i turn screen back on, it instantly starts playing again! its making the app unworkable. i have had spotify premium for around 4 years, and this is first time it has failed me. i have tried to contact spotify, on twitter & limited advice has not helped. i have an s8, and latest app version"
299,Spotify,Levi,1,0,"I Can't even Log In anymore and i tride to send an email verification but the program not recognise any of my email. i want to cancel my subscribtio and i don't want to pay Â£9.99 per month as i don't use it anymore the this app. i jus checked my balance and it took down the money from my account...is unfair for paying for something that is no used i can even "" log in "" so besicaly you taking my money without my permision !!!!"
300,Spotify,Randson Cunha,2,0,"this app is stop what I'm listening and starting to play musics that doesn't have nothing to do with what I use to listen. also, it starts to play some random bullslhit music from no where that i don't like at all. all these behaviors are very inconvenient."
301,Spotify,Bashkim Ukshini,1,0,"over a year usage, still cant learn my taste. worst song suggestions than free apps. why do all song suggestions must be sad, graveyard songs? in youtube, you can plan one song, hit the playlist button and you'll be send places, for hours!"
302,Spotify,A Google user,1,0,"Oh it's great except for the part where it doesn't play the song you want! I tap on a song, it gives me details about the song, it will shuffle other songs, but for some reason I can't seem to play the song I want. what am I doing wrong?"
303,Spotify,Bee Bee,3,0,"I used to love this app... now it's pissing me off because it keeps losing connection, and will not play the entire song. Fix the bugs pls so I can back to liking this app. Plus I'm paying for it."
304,Spotify,Chris Alford,1,0,was listening to the podcast relatable by Allie Beth stuckey and then all of a sudden it was removed. I'm tired of conservatives being censored by far-left organizations. my account will be cancelled soon.
305,Spotify,Snarky Darky,2,4,"premium is 5 stars- spotify is a great music service, however the free version is obnoxious. i understand that you need to make money, but adds should be enough. you dont have to actively fight against the person using by putting music in their playlist that they never added, or not letting you chose your own song. I remember when you would pay just to get rid of adds instead of getting an interface that doesnt actively fight against you."
306,Spotify,Shashank Nerurkar,4,0,The free version has far too many adverts. You guys gotta understand some of us can't put the money and just want some sort of music. Its incredibly annoying to have an ad every 3 songs that is as far as 40 seconds long and is unskipable.
307,Spotify,Sreejith T Das,5,0,Spotify premium gives perfect song recommendations as daily mix. It also acts like a remote when you play on other devices. Playlist resumes when you play it again. Spotify is miles ahead of its competitors. Spotify has a playlists for almost every genre and mood.
308,Spotify,William Borrill,1,0,"upgraded to premium for 3 months, only to have so many technical issues, even after I upgraded to a new phone, had the same issues. back to the free version and I have none of these issues. I was unable to skip songs without actually opening the app, constantly froze and went to a black screen with a play and skip button, would not close properly and drain my battery. To top it off, it's near impossible to contact Spotify for support or complaints, so here I am."
309,Spotify,Otsile Modiselle,2,0,"Bewildered by how awkward the queue system is. I hear the shuffle button is for playlists only. But why the heck is it there still after adding random albums to the queue? And what's this sub queue (up next) within the queue thing? Inception queuing? It's confusing and annoying. Sometimes, most times in fact, I don't want to create playlists. I just want to and to queue and shuffle. The heavy focus on playlisting's a little ritualistic"
310,Spotify,Blessel Latina,5,1,"It used to be an awesome app, this is my escape app everyday. But lately 
I'm not able to use it. It stops and closes automatically. I have strong 
internet connection but tells me ""Connection failed"" and does not load any 
icon (home, search, library etc) which makes it useless for me. The widget 
also disappeared. Please fix. Thanks."
311,Spotify,Sean McClellan,1,18,"They still haven't put recently played back in the library, It comes up on the home page in a different spot every time and only shows like five albums. The recently played list was the most used feature for me. Now I have to search the artist or go through my entire library and there's a five second delay every time you try and open an album or artist. Spotify clearly doesn't care about the customers or our feedback. I don't pay for a family plan to have features removed and the app run badly."
312,Spotify,ragan protzman,3,0,Not being able to add a cover picture or a description without a macbook is... come se dice... dumb. I've never seen another app have so many discrete versions of the same thing.
313,Spotify,WillWilson Dev,3,0,"With Spotify being as big as it is I'm still suprised there is no sleep timer. Additionally I feel I am being jipped when it comes to discovering new songs as the weekly ""recommendations"" channel repeats many songs I disliked and has not nearly as many songs that would last a week of music listening. Make a daily discover Playlist and add a sleep sumer for 5 stars"
314,Spotify,Megan Montgomery,1,0,"the last update sucks, i cant find my songs, i dont want to use the stupid playlist feature that doesn't work half the time for saving whole albums. why ""update"" a app if it wasn't broken to begin with. fix this s*it"
315,Spotify,FurFourSTUDIOS ORIGINAL,1,1,"1. Before the update, it was SO NICE. Now? It just adds random songs i dont like, i dont know, etc. to my playlists. 2. Even if I try to hide the random songs in my playlists, it just doesnt work. I. Hate it."
316,Spotify,A Google user,2,3,I really love using this app but there are issues like when my screen is off it sounds like a scratched disk. I cannot use the widget on screen saver mode. I hope this can be improved and made better. I waited for this app for so long here in DXB. I hope the wait and the subcription is still practical and worth it.
317,Spotify,Phillip Brasfield,1,0,Worthless trash. You must have good service to use this trash. No real offline mode. Worked awesome until new interface! Now it cries about me being offline.  11$ pain in the... just use Google it's 5 stars better.
318,Spotify,A Google user,4,25,"It should have lyrics as amazon music has. It should allow us to see the number of times a song has been played. It should show songs that almost match the search after mistyping, as YouTube does... A bunch of my favorite songs are not available"
319,Spotify,Mali Rowe,3,7,"can someone help? i am only able to download an entire podcast if i press the little download button on every single episode. i looked up the question on google and found: ""To save an artist's entire discography you would have to click the ""+"" next to every song to save it to your ""songs"" section which also will save it under Avicii in the artists section. Or you can add every song to a playlist."" this seems really unreasonable, especially considering i signed up for the paid plan."
320,Spotify,joceyln b,3,0,The app is good but they need to calm down with ads. Every three songs I get an ad not joking. It's do annoying and I'm not going premium. So please fix this spotify.
321,Spotify,Mark Defew,5,1,"Since late February the app either crashes or music cuts out making it almost impossible to listen to. Bluetooth controls no longer work either, on earphones or in car. Broken app for me at the moment on Samsung S9 Pie. Until last month the app was great."
322,Spotify,Todd Payne,4,0,Spotify has 99% of the music I love and I can make Playlists of only the songs I want to listen to. Update: 4/12/19 - Chromebook App has stopped loading and just puts up a blank screen. Tried upadating and reinstalling but to no avail. Browser Web player seems to work fine on the Cromebook. Phone App and Desktop site still are my favorite way to listen to music.
323,Spotify,Rendi PW,5,17,"Nice app, nice song, nice playlist! Finally, you fix artist tab problems. Thanks for hearing us. Gonna be premium user again. Nb: please don't change anything that no need to be changed."
324,Spotify,Marv Vasquez,4,0,"4/20/19 FIXED! For Android devices 1. Settings 2. Apps 3. Spotify 4. Storage 5. Clear Data 6. uninstall 7. re-install 8. enjoy 3/18/19 - Songs stop abruptly or won't play the next song in queue. When I check the app, it relaunches so it seems to be crashing every so often. Galaxy Note9"
325,Spotify,Nefi Feliz,1,1,"I've loved everything about Spotify all up until the last update. after updating the app, I have noticed my music pauses unexpectedly while locked and the music won't resume playing unless I physically press one of the button of my Glaxy S10+. The music plays for like a minute or two, it pauses, the songs looks like it's still playing but nothing is being heard. I'm a Premium Family Plan owner, so please fix ASAP or I'm taking my money elsewhere!"
326,Spotify,Scott McQuade,2,1669,"Buggy app that crashes immediately, even after reimstalling and deleting the cache. I can't cancel my account without logging in and there is no way to contact Spotify. No answers on their help system, but plenty of complaints in the community - since at least 2012. ""We're always making improvements"" they say but it looks like they lack the competence to get the basics right."
327,Spotify,Gretchen,5,0,"I love this app so much, however, I have a suggestion! Being able to personalize the looks of spotify instead of having a black and green default would be so cool and more aesthetically pleasing. Having a cluttered library and a dark default is not very appealing so making some adjustments in order to make the app brighter and add the ability to personalize would be very cool! Again, I love this app and it will always be my go-to, however some adjustments may be beneficial."
328,Spotify,Danilo Figueroa,1,68,"New update automatically says i have every song i listen ""liked"". Not only that, now in the Daily Mixes, artists and songs I don't like cannot be removed. On top of that, if i remove the ""heart"" on songs i have downloaded, it removes the download! Spotify, quit changing those functions on the app! If I like a song, its so your algorithm will play more songs like it. The songs I downloaded, doesn't mean I automatically like them, quit forcing downloads based off of likes!"
329,Spotify,Deion B,1,1,"I love Spotify. EDIT: Updating this review since 16MAY2017. I'm glad I've had this the past year and a half. I can never go back to Google Play Music where all my downloads randomly disappeared and never had to worry about that with Spotify. EDIT (18APR2019): My account was signed out and asked me to switch from offline, but it wouldn't let me through. Had to reinstall Spotify and redownload my music. Reviews from last year express the same issue. Changed from 5 stars to 1 star. Disappointing."
330,Spotify,JAPlayz Games,5,0,"Great app, almost perfect! My minor complaint is that the search bar for finding songs in your playlist is in with the other options. Why not put the search bar to the top of the playlist? It will be a lot easier, in my opinion."
331,Spotify,Samuel,4,11,"I love Spotify, it's better than YouTube Music, Apple Music, Google play music, or whatever Samsung/Sony uses I know it's better. The only I problem I have is the ability no to slide to queue like iPhones. Please add slide to queue, it makes things so much faster. And, WHEN I TURN OFF AUTOPLAY IT SHOULDN'T COME BACK ON! Its so annoying, I hate autoplay and just wish I could leave it off. Overall, this app is the best ever created music app ever. trash layout, bring the old one back."
332,Spotify,Daniel H.,1,1,"Okay, it's really time to get your act together. Infinite loading results with a perfect connection, having to close the app multiple times to return results, almost minute long delays to play a damn song. Galaxy S8. Do you care or are you incompetent? I pay for this and am so sick of this amateur application that should be far better. Actions speak louder than words, and for your company I hope to finally see action. You don't even post changelogs on here anymore. Seriously, come on."
333,Spotify,Flor1k,1,2,"Very annoying user experience, (at least for free version). I search for a song, tap shuffle play, something else starts playing. No way to play the song I want. Video adds pop up very often, a notification of my ""daily mix"" that I can't dismiss always there... Intrusive and I always have the feeling I can't control what music is playing. I'm just better off with plain free youtube than this for music.Edit: 2 stars to 1, playlist takes a few minutes to load lately."
334,Spotify,Julie Ann McSweeney,2,25,Update this app again it's gone slow and it keeps telling me that I have no Internet connection. Also songs that I have in my play list are saying not available when I click on them even though they are in my play list fix this problem please
335,Spotify,Flip Chriceol,5,0,"Pandora killer. This app is seamless. It also connects easily to your home theater through your PlayStation or most other smart devices. Use it everyday. No other music app needed. New albums on release day. Choose your songs, Playlist, and even find new music really easily."
336,Spotify,Michael Timmerman,2,0,"Was good in 2018 but as of 2019 this app is glitchy and has issues even playing music, home screen widget does not work. does not work properly when connecting to mobile devices like Galaxy Watch. I have a paid Premium account and the app says I'm not a premium subscriber and blocks access to features. I think it's time to jump ship cause this app is sinking!!!!"
337,Spotify,Dan Spaghetti Master,5,19,"Works very well, I would like an option to download an entire artists work with a simple button but it's still good without it. I would definitely recommend. one big problem I've noticed is that when you close the app it stops playing music, I know that sounds dumb but the default music player keeps playing music despite closing the app. I like to close apps when I'm finished with them and I usually hit clear all for ease, it's just a little bit frustrating to have to go back into the app."
338,Spotify,Luiza Nacif Coelho,4,9,"look don't get me wrong, i love Spotify. but its definitely missing some essencial features. First of all, a ""Merge with other Playlist"" button should be implemented. I ended up being a playlist hoarder, cause whenever i try to organize, it takes me forever Second, it would be nice to have a symbol near the playlists that already have the song youre trying to add to a playlist. lastly, it would be nice if, whenim trying to put songs on a playlist, it shows up on top of the playlist page."
339,Spotify,Zachary Gamer,4,92,"I personally hate the 'We Added' thing because during shuffle play, I want to listen to only the songs I added to it. People add songs to the playlist just to listen to those hand-picked songs. If the purpose of it is to show new songs to users, then you can put the songs on the home page instead of a playlist so the function doesn't get removed, but relocated. I would definitely give Spotify a 5 star rating if this is changed. The feature just feels useless in the playlists."
340,Spotify,Lex Nunez,2,0,"This app was my life... Now it's slow and when it finally works, it crashes over time. I don't know what's going on but this needs to be fixed."
341,Spotify,Donte' Scarlette,5,0,Amazing App literally use it everyday of every hours and having the premium subscription really adds to the whole experience. However even without premium its still an amazing app. The spotify library is filled with all the things you would and wouldn't expect it's all around a solid app and i just love it.
342,Spotify,Melissa N,1,1,"Paid user, last update is garbage, songs stop midway through then refuse to play or restart. Cleared cache, cleared memory, reinstalled, nothing helps. Doesn't matter if it's bluetooth, data or wifi, still having the same issue. I used to brag about how Spotify was the best and never had any issues, I'm over it and on the verge of canceling my account."
343,Spotify,Carlos Lopez,2,26,"It was good until last update. Now It won't let me use the bluetooth controls in my car, it won't let me go back to start a song, if I'm listening to a song and go back to a different song, when the song I was listening to starts again it starts half way through the song. Please fix, its becoming annoying."
344,Spotify,Nic Strugnell,1,0,Still the worst app around! Now it won't log back in if I have it set to offline mode. oh i need to go online to open the app? Really! how exactly do I do that if i have to be logged in to turn off offline mode!! Ever heard of a logic loop? Spotify app has been a real disappointment for years now ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬
345,Spotify,Alfredo Reyes,4,0,i love the app but there's one thing that bothers me. i really wish we could have a setting that blocks any song that has anything to do with romance. just for when people are going through things. thank you for reading this
346,Spotify,Demi Tyla Photography,5,0,Customer service spot on! I was so close to writing a 1 star as I've been having technical issues lately.. decided to do a contact form on the website but knew with it being Easter Sunday that I wouldn't get a response for a few days.. then I realise someone via online chat had answered my question and helped me through the process to fix my technical issue. extremely fast response so I'm really happy!
347,Spotify,little cats,1,0,i hate that when i put a spasific song on and then when it done i have no controle over witch song i want to put on i want to lisen to ONE song then i hear another song that a. i dont like b. i have no controll over witch song i hear and c. if i take the song off the play list another song takes its place so i dont like this app
348,Spotify,Dean Wilson,1,0,"I recently switched my family plan from Google Play Music to Spotify and this app absolutely sucks! There is no functionality from the lock screen. You can press the buttons all day long and they won't work. This is a pain during a workout, as I have to unlock screen to change songs. I still haven't figured out how to like or dislike songs. I'm going to wait a few days to see if they fix the bugs. If not, I'll be switching back to Google Play music."
349,Spotify,Mugdha Soni,2,0,"Really disappointed with spotify. Not providing a lot of content which is available in other countries to india . Otherwise a really good app with good quality songs and podcasts . But please provide artists like coldplay, ed sheeran etc ."
350,Spotify,J Cai,1,1,"Bad user experience. Suck that pay-user interface is totally different than free user interface. Subscribe plan not worth and attract. Spotify Should take a look at Xiami Music. Spotify always change my search taste , no animation/ACG albums. Tired for the Recommend playlist and cover repeat again and again nothing new /excited. Never gets to know my favorite artist release new song/album. More than 3 steps to search new release with limited fliter options (by country, by album/Single/ost)."
351,Spotify,Jonas Kersulis,1,6,"With a strong connection to a fast WiFi network, I still have to stare at a spinning circle all the time. When the app updates, the downloads get deleted and have to be downloaded again. When I switch songs or pause, the app can take several seconds to stop playing the current song. The app frequently freezes up and must be closed before it will work again."
352,Spotify,Nikhil Dass,5,0,The app is superb but please add shuffle and repeat options in the app for mobile .... i am currently using an android samsung device and i do get the option for shuffle or repeat while using the app... see to it ... it might bother a lot of people like me
353,Spotify,Jason Barton,4,0,"I love the service and have been using for years now as a premium member. However this last update (April 9) keeps dropping out mid songs; its infrequent, it pauses for some seconds, like its been turned off, then resumes."
354,Spotify,Myriah Pugh,1,7,"Don't wanna say I hate it but I rather pay for Tidal than use this app at all. ""Shuffle play"" then u add random songs that don't even relate to the playlist. How those that convince me to want to use your app at all when you have all the control over MY music. Not to mention the ads but anyway I'm done ranting, 1 star."
355,Spotify,Taylor,1,3,"Used to love this app but for the last few months it's been nothing but a pain to use, constantly sluggish, often freezes and crashes, but the worst problem is the app changes the storage location from my sd card to internal storage without permission!! ðŸ¤¬ I have to redownload my entire library of 4000 songs which can take up to 2 days. Might have to give Apple Music a try, has to be better than this trash."
356,Spotify,Rod Moten,1,0,The Spotify app shouldn't require the internet to browse artists. It should allow users to browse downloaded music by artist. The only way to retrieve music by artist when not connected to the internet is by search using the artist's name. But search doesn't group the somgs by album. To search you have to explicitly put the app in offline mode. The app should automatically go into offline mode when not connected to the internet.
357,Spotify,Sara Sparrow,2,0,"having to sit through 7 adverts one after another just to listen to 1 song is ridiculous. then after the 1 song back to adverts. if this carrys on I will delete this. this was a good app. now like everything else, unless you pay your bombarded with adverts"
358,Spotify,Shiv chauhan,4,0,although they charged me thrice. still music quality is slightly better than apple music(at least that's what i think). surely better in discovering music. many songs are not available for no reason. I'd suggest you go for apple music. apple music is also cheaper so it's better.
359,Spotify,Ragnorak's Hope,4,0,"Spotify was good until they added the last 3 updates.. Music stops randomly and the notification bar for Spotify is super glitchy. It annoys me to have to go back to Spotify to unpause the music every 10 minutes. Overall, the app is great. I used this app for about 3 or 4 years and I really like the experience this app gives. If Spotify fixes the glitches, I would appreciate it and the rest of the community that are experiencing the glitches to would too."
360,Spotify,LotusStudiO,3,1,"I like most things about this app, But there is a little problem. that problem is that, Whenever I type a song name. A song comes, but when I press on it, a playlist comes and has some unwanted songs. So what I am saying is that to fix that tiny problem, Overall the app is amazing to use I suggest this app, If you are looking for a 'music playing' app"
361,Spotify,Lindsey Hanley,1,3,With the most recent update I can no longer set my phone on it's side and have it rotate. I don't understand why they would take that feature away. I used it daily and now I'm frustrated almost every time I'm listening to music.
362,Spotify,Jeffrey Stewart,4,0,"I'm a paying premium user. This version of the app has missing features compared to other versions. Where is the RADIO feature??!! And do not send me to read the support article about ""why has the app changed?"" testing new features..."
363,Spotify,Adam Fontaine,1,0,0 stars. This app is unbelievably slow and at times unresponsive. The app has never worked seamlessly on my device. Very frustrating. Doesn't maintain internet connection. No customer service.
364,Spotify,Daniel Olson,4,1,"well I'm going to wait for another good deal to upgrade, but I find it amusing that the only commercial interruptions are to market the premium version of the app. I have noticed on occasion that the desktop version will just stall out between commercials. also... unless I'm missing something, the mobile app free version gives you a shuffle play option ONLY.. you can't listen to anything in original order"
365,Spotify,six,3,0,"disappointing compared to the spotify app i have on my computer. i dont see why i can play individual songs on loop on my computer, but i can't listen to individual songs or loop on my phone? i just want to be able to play the song i'm in the mood for instead of having to use a whole ass playlist."
366,Spotify,Damien Fry,1,0,the new update is AWFUL! I can no longer view all my downloaded songs or even the artists! All I can do is go to playlists and albums or search artists online! I pay for premium but it feels and looks like a cheap and nasty free version. If they don't fix soon I'm cancelling!
367,Spotify,Christie Krzesinski,5,0,Gives me access to the music i â™¡. living in GA our music stations are conservative. Although Atlanta has amazing venues with all my favorite artists. Spotify thank you for giving me the opportunity to listen to artists i enjoy 24/7.
368,Spotify,Vinit Nair,3,0,"Whenever I try to pay for premium via UPI, the app says my pin code isn't valid for the country, but it very much is. Please look into the matter, I'd love to subscribe to the premium account."
369,Spotify,Rahul Rana,4,4,"Almost every song i like is there except one.. ""In the Heat of the moment by Noel gallaghar"". please add this song and you can have my 5 stars. Otherwise i will come down to 1 star."
370,Spotify,lexus jacobs,4,0,"awesome app. though of lately the shuffle algorithm is bit irritating. songs are played twice in a row before skipping to the next track. and on shuffle tendency is to only or mostly play artist's most recent and popular tracks. an option for ""proper shuffling "" would be awesome."
371,Spotify,Cj Packard,5,3,"Unfortunately I have to complain again... I can't skip songs from the lock screen on my S9+ even though I have premium. Please fix this, it's really important for me to have that opportunity."
372,Spotify,David Marshall,5,2,The app works but has become slow to load when opening. There is some work needed to make load times quicker than what is 1 or 2 minutes sometimes. Still the best streaming service overall.
373,Spotify,Linda Saliba,1,20,It seems that Spotify had a recent update and it is not going well on my phone (Galaxy S9+). The app now randomly crashes and will literally just stop playing the song/podcast I'm listening. The most disappointing thing is that i can no longer control my music from my lock screen or through the bluetooth in my car. I've had spotify premium for YEARS and absolutely LOVED it before these issues started. UPDATE: its been over a month and things have only gotten worse. Considering cancelling v. soon
374,Spotify,Nollaig Johansen,3,0,I use Spotify a lot but have some issues. Why aren't podcasts integrated properly into the app? The downloaded episodes are 'hidden' in the interface. The app should prioritise podcasts 'for me' in all views as i use them a lot.
375,Spotify,Morgana Mercer,4,1,"the best music app I've had so far, a few little bugs(like not being able to connect my Facebook at all on it) other than that, its brilliant, and I'm satisfied with the student discount too which is very cost effective if you're in college"
376,Spotify,Christina Daugherty,5,0,"I love the fact that if you get premium you can download the songs for when you dont have service, works amazing for road trips. Also even without premium I love the playlists they have made especially for me from the songs I save, and they organize them by genre! The ads are bad without premium, all you go to do while your listening is watch the ads for 30 mins with no ads. I've been using spotify for 2 years now and I absolutely love it."
377,Spotify,Isaac Zephyr,3,0,"I really like the app, even if it doesn't have everything I listen to (mainly game tracks missing, but eh). Larger issue though, a recent update made it so liked songs and albums are separated. I used to like just listening to everything on shuffle, but now I either need to choose between singles and albums (you also can't like individual songs on an album if you like the whole album...) or else make a playlist. Not too pleased with that new infrastructure."
378,Spotify,Airman Zim,2,0,"Your service is great, your app App automatically loads and pmays when connecting yo my car by itself. But also randomly pauses when uses headphones while on a run. Please fix"
379,Spotify,Abigayle Chartier,3,0,"a really good music app if you're looking for a wide range of music, but theres so many adds. I get like 3 adds every second song and Spotify premium is so expensive. 11$ for a month? it used to be cheaper and there were less adds. might as well listen on your computer so you can at least choose what songs you can listen to before you get another add"
380,Spotify,Olivia Peters,2,0,"I've been using spotify since forever and I used to like it, but recently its been terrible. The ads are so bad like today it started out with the ""30 seconds of ads"" notice, then a 30 second ad, then another ad to get me to get spotify premium and then i got another ad and this was one after another. Like at this point everyone should know what spotify premium is so stop giving me ads about it. The recent update also sucks if anything it makes the app harder to use rather than easier."
381,Spotify,first last,1,0,"Instead of running normal commercials, Spotify insists on reminding on that I'm listening to Spotify and I should buy premium. That will not make people buy premium, its just annoying. Spotify appears to make their business to annoy users instead of selling commercial time to other companies. That sucks."
382,Spotify,Stephen W,5,0,"Are you dumb? Its unlimited streaming or local music for 10 bucks a month and is supported in Amazon, Google, and car interfaces. Just get it already."
383,Spotify,Erik Moore,1,0,"This app sucks & I'm uninstalling it right after posting this. A big issue is when I try to play from a particular album, it might play 1 or 2 songs from that album, then goes to other songs from the same artist (or sometimes even other artists, some I've never heard of) without finishing the album I selected. I don't care at all about playing songs in order, but if I select an artist or album, it should stick to it & I refuse to upgrade to premium just for that. What a waste of time & energy."
384,Spotify,Ty de la Cruz,3,0,spotify worked fine on my galaxy s8 until I upgraded to the galaxy s10. music cuts out randomly and I have to double tap the screen for it to continue playing while screen is off. don't know if it is the app or my bluetooth.
385,Spotify,Noor Zeffry,1,0,Can't download the music. Stops everytime after each song. Fix this fast or will change to different apps. Paid for premium but useless now.
386,Spotify,Ravi Vardhan,4,0,"Extensive collections spanning everything from from classical to hip hop, oldies to latest and retro and in Indian, Punjabi, Western- just about everything. Streams seamlessly. Only irritants are the too frequent ads and spiels to push the paid version."
387,Spotify,Vikaytee 95,2,0,i dont know what the hell happened but id rly appreciate if someone fixes this. i was using spotify for a while and i turned it off. when i turned it back on i went back to the app and it was logged out for no reason and so i logged in and i see that all my downloads are gone pls help me i downloaded like 4000+ songs
388,Spotify,Lara Marshall-Roberts,2,0,"It has great music, but I cant listen to my playlist on my Amazon Echo as this is a premium feature, which I think is a scam. I think this as I purchased my Alexa with the hope of listening to anything on it, only to have Spotify ruin that. It also adds random music that I dont like to my playlists which I find extremely inconvenient and it automatically shuffles the playlists. You cant download music unless you have a premium account but I dont want to waste a lot of money on this."
389,Spotify,Adam Fryberger,4,13,LOVE Spotify over all other music apps. Easy interface and great music recommendations based on you're interests. Highly recommend! Would give 5 stars but having issues lately with connecting to other devices.
390,Spotify,Joshua Hahn,2,0,"ummm... is there a reason why your decade-old, subscription-based, billion-dollar music streaming company produced an app that is an unstable buggy mess? Did you feel that you had too many customers?"
391,Spotify,Hunter Wardman,1,0,My app keeps on randomly pausing. The widget in my notifications when I swipe down from the top says that it is still playing music but it isnt... this happens literally every 10 minutes and whether I'm online or listening to downloaded tunes offline.... Needs fixing!!!! Will edit review when fixed. 16 April 2019
392,Spotify,Canyon Tek,1,4,"Absolutely abysmal to use. A service that I am paying for should not be this slow. Give me an option to turn off song animations, actually play the song I select when I select it, and start paying artists more money to put they're music on your platform"
393,Spotify,Boz D,2,8,"I'm paying for a service and you're force feeding me content I would rather not listen to. If I don't want to listen to an artist, I should be able to block them. IOS has it... Android doesn't. I pay the same money as the other guys. I want the same service. Or maybe Apple Music?"
394,Spotify,A Google user,1,84,"since the last update , the app has been stopping in the middle of the song. it happens more frequently that it comes to the point of me putting this harsh comment. I have a premium account and is considering of terminating it, if this still continues. i use to love Spotify when it first started but terrible app"
395,Spotify,Keith Smith,2,31,"Awful since the last update. Crashing, or taking forever to load. Spotify customer service told me to restore my phone to factory settings to fix ðŸ¤£. They need to look at all the comments on here and quickly realise it's the app that's the problem. Does anyone have a recommendation for a music streaming service because if it's not fixed soon I'm going somewhere else."
396,Spotify,mckinley xie,2,0,"The app is designed with features that make life worse... there's no reason you shouldn't be able to listen to a single song on its own, and yet... No problems with podcasts, though... In the end, I ntink Coogle Play Music is much better."
397,Spotify,Karina Vasquez,2,0,Ever since the new update it just doesn't load and is very laggy. I used to love this app and always use it but now it barely works. I would say not to download it unless they fix this problem.
398,Spotify,Lyric Alex-Alizye Lamoore,2,10,Spotify still freezes and has load issues. This has been going on for months no matter how much you troubleshoot. It makes your music experience frustrating with the app which makes me gives Spotify 2 stars.
399,Spotify,Sander De Gelder,3,0,"Geweldig aanbod aan muziek, helemaal top. Offline-modus is echt heel fijn. Alleen jammer dat de app zelf ontzettend traag is. Door muziek navigeren gaat heel traag, zelfde met navigeren door menu's. Zo irritant dat als je de opties van een nummer wilt openen vaak een melding krijgt dat je online moet zijn terwijl ik dat ben. De dienst is dus helemaal super. De app zelf kan nog zeker verbeteren."
400,Spotify,A Google user,5,0,Enjoy making my playlists and have discovered so much music since I got this app stuff I missed out from years ago. Good value for money and have saved so much on not buying cds many which when I bought and there was only a few tracks I really liked. Now I can be selective. Love this app.
401,Spotify,Cotopaxi,2,0,"If you have a slow connection then the app is basically unusable. Yet other music apps work just fine just slowly. The app will also randomly delete all downloaded music you have yet still take up the space as if you had it downloaded. Considering how big spotify is, I don't understand how this has never been fixed. Spotify also automatically opens in the background if you connect to bluetooth when someone else is using it and it doesn't close until you force stop it. So many broken things."
402,Spotify,Goutham Kumar,1,5,"The offline mode is pathetic, takes ages to find the desired song. Half the artists are not present, no Coldplay, charlie puth and to top it all off i lose my downloads stored on my sd card every time i restart my phone..I regret subscribing for a year, pathetic pathetic interface, offline mode... Wish i could rate it 0"
403,Spotify,Adam Freeman,2,3,"i am a premium user and love the music experience on Spotify, BUT these stability issues on android 9 (ðŸ¥§) have to be fixed. i have been putting up with extemely slow page load times for nearly a month. im talking about 15 sec + makes it pretty much un usable. I can no longer recommed spotify to my friends with confidence. Came here to see if i could revert to a previous build. Looks like i cant. maybe time to look elsewhere"
404,Spotify,Shaun Mason,2,0,this app has been great since about a week ago... it's now has long silent pauses in songs at random points. I cant actually listen to a song now. This needs to be fixed asap before I leave
405,Spotify,Jen Jud,3,0,"I love Spotify, but not so much on Android. somehow this is just much easier to use on my iPad. android UI is especially bad in Offline mode. the home scren doesnt show your offline playlists."
406,Spotify,Magdalena Valdez,1,0,I hated it even with premium I didn't get my favorite songs. And they need more and better songs on Spotify. I try to do Voice Search and it keeps saying to say it again.
407,Spotify,Maya Zee,1,0,"They were offering a free Google Home Mini to premium customers who were paying $9.99/month and not to premium family members who were paying $14.99/month. How does that even work?? And when asked about it, the customer service representative said ""It's like visiting your favorite burger shack - you can order set meals that have different packages.""??? Poor marketing strategy and customer service."
408,Spotify,A Google user,5,0,This is the best app for music so i have suggested to many of my friends and we all love it! only problem i have is that sometimes random songs would play and its kinda annoying but still 5 stars!ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ŒðŸ˜€
409,Spotify,YOGESH PANDEY,5,8,"If you want a sound quality which is superior than that being provided by other music streaming platforms, Spotify is the app you should definitely go for. The Playlist and Song suggestions are highly accurate. Besides these, the Premium membership for Spotify is also great and comes under a broad spectrum of price range.Though some songs and artists are missing, yet we hope that Spotify will take this into account and recover from this situation. Hands Down for Spotify!!."
410,Spotify,Lee CC,2,0,"Okay, so for the new update, the mini videos are not available for the songs anymore, and some Genius annotations remain missing. I don't understand why? I still enjoy the Premium feature very much, but these new changes are a bit overboard."
411,Spotify,Den muterte dritt grisen! xD,3,145,"Cool app, but annoying you are ""forced"" to shuffle an album for a non-member. I understand the concept of earning money and the previlege of being member. But after hearing ads after each 3rd song, not being able to skip more 5 songs, a non-member should be allowed to play a particular song in a album. ^^ Also very annoying you can't play anything with the Spotify webplayer on both pc and phone. This was possible on computer before, but now you are forced to use the app. -,-"
412,Spotify,Marie Ymata,2,0,It goes well before but now it suddenly stopped after several songs. I don't see any problem with my wifi connection. Pls fix this. Can't even fully use my premium because of this unlike before. It's annoying.
413,Spotify,Tommy Anderson,4,4,"Spotify is a solid music player, and probably the best on the market as far as I can see. I feel as though the restrictions for non-paid users on mobile is a bit much, hence the 4 stars, but I suppose they do need to make money somehow."
414,Spotify,red calx,1,0,"Why on earth does a music streaming service need to know my gender and date of birth? And really, ""non-binary"". What the hell is that? You people really have gone quite mad. No matter, I shall take my custom elsewhere."
415,Spotify,Sam Bourgault,2,1,"I don't like the new search function, or the one before that. It's true the music randomly stops. So now the download button is a heart symbol? I can love a track without wanting it downloaded. We've gone from Starred Songs, to Plus, to now Heart that really means download. Just keep changing things.And I ""unloved"" a track and it's giving me quirky comments? ""let's pretend that never happened"". OMG Spotify are you a person? You have such a personality! I love spotify. The app is getting worse."
416,Spotify,Petar Radisic,2,0,"I have Samsung S10 Plus and when the screen is locked media controls do not work. They are visible and clickable on the lock screen, however when I click them nothing happens. Any solution for this?"
417,Spotify,Ajay Oraon,2,0,need alot of update. Am thankful for bringing Spotify to play store after my complaints. But update for song selection and alot of playlist is missing & even the songs are missing. it's never late but need to be quick fix.
418,Spotify,Troy Wojtaszek,2,3,"Constantly become slower and taking away awesome features. I used to be able to just swipe down in a playlist to search a song or reorder it, but now it makes you click a few more buttons before you can. Aren't you supposed to make things more user-friendly and easier as your progress not go backwards?"
419,Spotify,Ujjaval Agarwal,4,0,"I love the Spotify App. Thank you for bringing this to India I just have one complain against the App. As soon as I make a call or get a call if the song is playing through Spotify, it disappears after the call. I have to go the app through multi tasking again to start the song. Its a weird thing. The song should just start from where it was and should not disappear from the screen."
420,Spotify,Thor Odinson,2,6,With every update they seem to add something to piss me off... It doesn't crash anymore but now the playlist order is determined by when you last changed the playlist and not the way you set them. Downloads are still being forgotten and need to be redownloaded.
421,Spotify,Javair Johnson,1,2,you've ruined the app by tinkering with what wasn't broken to begin with. I want to be able to play my library without having to touch my phone every 2 minutes or going thru the stress of having to populate a playlist manually. Fix it now or you'll be losing a lot of premium members.
422,Spotify,Anubhav Bhowmick,3,1,"I was more than happy with the Spotify free version with all the exquisite playlists and music to choose for. But after the premium subscription, there was unavailability of music from various artists. Is there any way to fix this? Edit: In spite of the unavailability of various songs, it does make up with curated playlists. ðŸ’¯"
423,Spotify,Rodrigo Andrade,4,0,"i would give more stars if i could see the lyrics, even as a premium member i still can't see it. if someone knows how to enable that option please tell me"
424,Spotify,Miguel Herrera Lopez,1,0,Fix bug issues. As soon as my screen times out music always stops. Other than that no complaints will change rate once fixed.
425,Spotify,Justin Hubbard,1,0,"got premium, will play 1 or 2 songs, and then stop, will have to unlock phone to start again. or it will randomly pause during songs.. not happy especially while paying for the service"
426,Spotify,Cole Gibson,3,0,"I love spotify and have been using it for years, but I dont love when I try to queue up a song and it tells me ""go online to see menu."" I see this message no matter what internet I am using, and sometimes it pops up over and over again until it decides to work. Please fix this so I can easily queue up songs and ignore my coworkers again like I used to be able to do."
427,Spotify,Nick Badamo,3,11,"Spotify is great and some of the issues I've had with the app have been fixed, but some things still aren't working. Spotify has been crashing on me lately in the middle of a song, even while I'm not doing anything else on my phone. Also, the play/pause and forward/back functions have not been working from the widget or my lock screen. There are also other things I wish were added, like the ability to add a song to multiple playlists at once and bringing the search and sort bar back to playlists"
428,Spotify,A Google user,1,5,Every now and again Spotify will for some reason switch from saving my downloaded music to my 32 gig sd card too my phone and if course it won't let me switch back so i have to uninstall the app like once week then redownload it along with my entire library which takes about three hours. SUUUUUPER ANNOYING. Not only that but i pay for this service and i still have to deal with this. not cool Spotify not cool. After most recent update it's not allowing me to save my music to my SD card.
429,Spotify,aesthetics,3,0,The old version is much better than the latest update but the app is still good. The only thing I hate about it is that why can't we set our own usernames? 'lyx678eeeszzxuv' Most of the usernames looks like this and I don't find it pleasing. I hope you can fix it. I hope the next time you let us set our own username.
430,Spotify,Brandon Wirthwein,1,0,"I used to use this on my tablet and it worked great, I didn't But premium and all I had to do was listen to adds every once and awhile which was fine. Now I got a phone and I can't even manually pick what song I want to listen to! It's insane that I have to listen through a hundred other songs just to get to the one I want! Plus you only give six skips per hour!! Spotify really sucks on phone and I wish it would go back to just having adds. Stop being so greedy and just let me listen to music!!!"
431,Spotify,Steven Copeland,3,0,"It's a nice app, until it locks you out while you're in offline mode. Then you have to uninstall/reinstall it to make it function again. It's irritating enough for me to knock two stars off of it because it's done this so many times in places where I have no data. Which is sort of the whole reason I pay for it."
432,Spotify,Natalia Yegoiants,2,1,PLEASE FIX THE LOCK SCREEN CONTROLS. I have to unlock my phone and go into spotify everytime I need to pause or change a song because the controls on the lock screen no longer work. My phone registers that I hit the button but nothing happens. It really makes the experience so unpleasant and inconvenient.
433,Spotify,Aryn Ogilvie,1,0,"I use this app and pay for premium because I enjoy the easy access to multiple types of music. However recently I have been having an issue with the app where I get logged out of the app, and as I am always in offline mode to save data, it says I cannot login in offline mode and must go into online mode to login...but I need to login to do it. now I have to redownload the 10+GB of music on my phone and reinstall the app. this issue has me questioning this app and product"
434,Spotify,Gray James,1,0,"CONSTANTLY crashing. Nonstop, all the time, takes about 30 minutes before it'll actually play my music consistently, but I can hardly skip songs or change my playlist without it freezing up on me again. EDIT: I had a Samsung Galaxy S7. I recently switched phones and now have a Samsung Galaxy S10+. It is doing the EXACT SAME THING! PLEASE fix your app! I pay for premium and I am beyond frustrated, I just want my music. This has been going on since last year."
435,Spotify,Jon Fowler,1,0,"Started behaving like a virus app and keeps launching itself, being intrusive and using battery. These are changes made as part of its anti piracy drive so it can sell shares at a higher price and is totally unacceptable. Deleted and treated myself to Deezer premium instead, would advise others to do the same. Similar price and performance without the virus features. UPDATE: Since writing this review, Spotify have mysyeriously deleted my account ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤”"
436,Spotify,A Google user,5,2,"I love this app, it is much more personalized than a lot of other music apps. I understand the excessive ad use but I'm taking off one imaginary star for playing Christmas Ads in October."
437,Spotify,Michele M,2,1,What is up with the stopping of songs on every single one? I use the paid version and this is happening on songs in Spotify AND downloaded songs. This needs to be fixed. It has been happening for about a month. I thought it would be fixed by now but whatever update happened it was not fixed. I have tried reinstalling as well. I read the reviews and it is happening to others as well. I'm extremely disappointed lately and will cancel my service and go listen to Pandora if not fixed.
438,Spotify,A Google user,1,0,App keeps stopping in the middle of songs. I have never had a problem before now. So frustrating I want to cancel my subscription unless it gets fixed quickly. Noone is interested in listening to half a chorus!
439,Spotify,Esther JY Kim,4,0,i liked how i can listen to most of the song i want to. but it doesnt keep playing songs when i turn off the scree. it wouldve been way better if i could still listen musics whilst the screen is off.
440,Spotify,Bryce Lail,1,8,"Now I am free user of this app and i am okay with shuffle play but if you can just stop put song I think would like in my playlist and albums. I want to listen to one artist and his one album stop forcing me to listen to other artists its annoy. Allow people to listen to what they want with out buying premiums and the ""hide"" song doesn't matter just play the songs on the playlist and albums and if I want to add a song I will do it myself."
441,Spotify,Kiki .C,4,0,"I really love this app! It has so many songs, and playlist. It was kinda confusing at first, but I got the hang of it. I just wish that the controls were more clear. But I really do recommend this app for music."
442,Spotify,Jon Ladd,4,0,"What happened??? Used to be Great selection + Ease of Use! Then, annoying 'beeps' started interrupting songs! Recharging battery, 'beeps' stopped. Wondering if the 'beeps' were just signaling low battery."
443,Spotify,Sebastian Marwecki,2,0,"family account not working (members get thrown out even though we share the same address). nice app for single use I guess, but the account system is broken/ misleading."
444,Spotify,Deadeyez 013,3,1,Usually works amazingly well. Unfortunately no longer works with headphones? Tested with cord and Bluetooth. I can hear every noise my phone makes with headphones in EXCEPT Spotify. If this isn't fixed soon I will have to stop paying.
445,Spotify,Sonia Orozco,5,0,it's great when you pay! if it's free then add get super annoying. I'm currently paying for the subscription because I listen all day at work and no complaints so far!
446,Spotify,John Austin,2,0,Biggest issue is that I can not access the SD card on my HP X2 Chromebook. When playing any artist playlist is always the same. UI took a downturn recently. Would be 5 stars if the android app worked properly on my chromebook.
447,Spotify,Chris Price,3,0,I love the selection and sound quality but your playlists kind of suck. For whatever reason songs will repeat three or four times on occasion. I'll go through and select a bunch of music to put in an album and they won't show up. The sort function never works properly. Definitely have some bugs you need to work out.
448,Spotify,Joseph Noel,1,0,we swapped after years and the Google Home integration is seriously bad. on top of that the desktop ad is atrocious. how is such a successful app so awful? good Lord
449,Spotify,sanjÃ¨Ã¨v,5,0,Thanks for changing the interface. I said it in my earlier review im glad you took the initiative. I have one more suggestion. Is there a possibility of choosing database of other regions i.e accessing U.S database in India. Because even though im from India I don't prefer Indian music i like the U.S interface better. Hopw you would look info this.
450,Spotify,Paul The Painter,1,0,if you are going to bloat your app with so many bells and whistles that my old phone and old Bluetooth equipment won't work with it anymore perhaps you could offer a Spotify lite. its important to me to be able to control the music from my truck without taking my eyes off the road.
451,Spotify,A Google user,1,65,"Trash app. Considering Apple music. Doesn't work with Bluetooth device controls (i.e. car, headsets). App won't close and notification won't clear unless app is force stopped. Can't change songs from notification ""widget""."
452,Spotify,Lori Hunt,4,0,This is a relatively easy to use app. I didn't have any problems connecting my devices and it sounds good and a lot of choices. I use the free version on my Android and my Windows device. You listen to some repeative ads which could be a bit more entertaining ( lol ). Other than the boring ads I give it ðŸ‘ðŸ‘
453,Spotify,Walter Esese,4,4,"I lovr Spotify, tried swithcing to apple music for a whule but came back. i really appreciate the integration of Spotify and having the account sync accross devices and using it as a remote. the music discovery is also top notch."
454,Spotify,Katie Burnside,1,0,"Awful update, gonna switch to apple music if nothing changes. So disappointing because i loved Spotify so much before the update. Bring back the option to browse through atrists whos songs youve already downloaded offline, and the shuffle all feature NEEDS to come back also the new heart/favourite feature is just unnecessary and confusing."
455,Spotify,Aayush Srivastava,1,0,why always Ad banner pop-up and not dismissed. its super annoying it must be fixed. i can't use interface of this app its just disgusting super annoying atleast If you give option to dismiss below banner then it must be working but its not so please please please i humbly request you.
456,Spotify,Abigail Harless,3,0,"currently there seems to be a problem on my Samsung device. I cannot pause, skip, or back track from the lock screen. it still provides the buttons and what song is playing, but I cannot click."
457,Spotify,Ellah Mills,4,0,"YouTube has less ads. good sound quality I guess, although that might just be the mic the artists used during recording. I switch to YouTube when I run out of skips. like the options of browsing music"
458,Spotify,Kalyssa Barris,2,0,"Loving it until recently. Music stops randomly, app freezes, and now the music skips! No other apps on my phone have this issue, plz fix soon or I'll need to cancel my subscription."
459,Spotify,Brenn Lontok,1,7,"Just unlimited skips would be so much appreciated on wifi. Disregard the free downloads, just please make the skips unlimited. The Praise and Worship songs covered here aren't anywhere else :("
460,Spotify,Shaurya Mishr,3,0,"Hey spotify why are missing out the repeat song feature out there. To be a big hit in India you must know that Indian audience replays a single over and over again that hit their minds, yet you're missing this feature. It's quite annoying."
461,Spotify,Alexander Stavropoulos,4,0,"It's a good service but the app is problematic. Its really easy to add songs especially if you connect shazam with it. But the devs keep removing useful features like being able to Search for a song in your playlist. Tell me one reason why i have to go to the playlist tap the 3 dots then select ""find in playlist"" instead of having a Search bar on the top? Why remove that. Also it would be really useful to add a shuffle button on the ""notification controller"" to enable and disable it."
462,Spotify,Anthony Morales,1,0,i moved back to Spotify cause i wanted to try TIDAL... i missed Spotify so much i came back to this streaming service only to find out THE NEW UPDATES MADE THIS WORSE THAN TIDAL. IM GONNA ASK FOR MY MONEY BACK TIDAL IS FREE WITH SPRINT MIGHT AS WELL STRESS OVER SOMETHING THATS FREE RATHER THAN PAY. HAVE TO SAVE SONGS SEPARATELY NO TRACK LIST OF ALL MY SONGS ITS OUTRAGEOUS THIS IS NO DIFFERENT THAN TIDAL
463,Spotify,S10 Chugh,3,0,i've used plenty of music apps and this is so far average. major problem there are not all the songs and all artists only few. secondly youre not able to shuffle your own playlists? why? thirdly it has alot of bugs keeps on hanging up and for some reason crashes if not able to respond back. lastly uses more of battery and net when compared to playmusic. so please give me one good reason to go premium on spotify and not other applications?
464,Spotify,Maran,4,0,"The ad banner isn't going off, even after the ad is over please remove that bug.. its literally annoying, as I have to restart everytime after an ad is over!!!!"
465,Spotify,Genevieve Fuentes,4,19,"Great app, but I gave it 4 stars, because everytime I move my phone the music would skip to a different part in the song. Not sure if it is my phone or the app, but I believe it is the app because I have tried other apps and that doesn't happen. Otherwise, awesome app. I definetly would recommend this music app. Thank you! ðŸ’œ"
466,Spotify,Tim Colbeck,5,0,Had crashing issue and turned iut my SD card was corrupted. i ejected it and now back to working perfectly. hope this helps others with same issue.
467,Spotify,Mia,5,0,"Love it so much! My only issue is the ability to undownload songs. I had to delete the app and then reinstall it to reset all of the downloads, which was fine but felt unnecessary. Overall it has a great format with has tons of music and Podcasts. I recommend this to all my of friends."
468,Spotify,Russell,5,0,Totally worth the money! They even have obscure artists that you couldn't find hardly anywhere else.
469,Spotify,Jessica Briceno,2,0,"Always have loved Spotify. Though with the recent update, as I see others have been commenting, it stops unless your phone is unlocked. I'm getting very frustrated and hope theres a new one coming soon to help!"
470,Spotify,Lydia Ortega,2,0,I love using this app. However recently with the new update it just stops playing the music. It is very annoying. Please fix that bug soon.
471,Spotify,Daniel Souch,5,0,"Been using this app for ages and not really had any problems but since this 
morning I can't open the app as it says No Storage Area Found. I've 
unmounted and mounted my external drive and even completely uninstalled the 
app and it still won't work. Completely unusable now :/"
472,Spotify,Pawan Herpalani,4,0,"Good app overall, what its missing currently is lyrics which is a must have feature for a top music app. I look for lyrics all the time which isn't convenient if I have to look outside the app. hope it will be available soon."
473,Spotify,Gupta Ravi,1,0,"Always appears a slide ostentating features of ""Premium""; well, that's fine. But it doesn't disappear even after clicking on ""Dismiss"" numerous times, neither by sliding upward nor by downward, nothing works. Although it does all the stupid work besides the work it's supposed to do. So in order to dimiss I have to close the App and restart."
474,Spotify,Aayush Goyal,4,0,"Amazing collection of songs and playlists. There are two downsides for me though. one is that in order to download a single song, I need to download the complete playlist. The other one is that due their ongoing legal war with Warner Bros Music there are some basic artists like Linkin Park, Coldplay, Ed Sheeran, and etc. that are missing. I just wish these 2 problems are resolved. Still, I think it's the best music streaming app out there."
475,Spotify,Tyler Meyers,2,0,"Normally I'd give Spotify a higher review, but it seems to have some bugs lately. My main issue is listening to podcasts. If I'm listening to longer episodes, there's a high likelihood that I'll have to pause it at some point, which seems to cause the problem. After the episode is paused, occasionally Spotify will reset to the beginning and I lose my place. It's happened a lot over multiple months. You'd think a multi-billion dollar company could fix this simple problem, but apparently not."
476,Spotify,Charles Dugaw,5,0,"My music tastes are varied and eclectic. I find myself discovering new styles and bands and then rediscovering others I had long ago discarded. I figured I could spend the subscriptiom fee to buy one album per month or pay the subscription fee and have access to thousands of songs. Money well spent, IMO."
477,Spotify,Keith Sandstrom,2,0,I purchased for my family and it only allows me to join as a Premium. No WAY to contact customer support. Horrible help!
478,Spotify,Stuart McGathan,4,0,"Slowly getting used to the switch now thay Google Music is going AWOL. The recommendations are phenomenal. The app becomes way more intutive and easy to use once you actually subscribe to premium, and the higher quality audio is great!"
479,Spotify,Louis Shapcott,3,19,"A few issues with the new updates. When I go to save/download an album, it doesnt cone up in my saved songs like it used to. This is a big problem Also, it still takes far too long to load things that shouldnt require internet connection, even when there is perfect signal. When i go to my library, sometimes the ""Liked songs"" option takes a while to come up if at all. Bring back the Browse tab"
480,Spotify,Joseph Salazar,4,0,App is very user friendly. The amount of music you have access to for the price is amazing in itself. The only reason I would not rate it 5 stars is due to them hiding the search feature for playlists.
481,Spotify,TheSilentType,3,1,"Having many connection issues when using a mobile network, even with full bars, it can be quite temperamental... Otherwise, this app is one of the best on the play store, and I use it basically everyday, but the connection issues is a deal breaker. If I can find a solution, I will rate higher."
482,Spotify,Vicki Burge,5,29,"Love this app. I am quite a lover of the arts and music is up at the top for me. Spotify almost always has any song I wish to hear-even the occasional eclectic music that I cannot find elsewhere. While I wish it was a bit cheaper, it is worth the money each month. KEEP MUSIC EDUCATION IN SCHOOLS!! There are so many proven and documented benefits!! Sports are important AND SO IS MUSIC!! In fact, quite often music helps athletes to center and to focus on the task at hand."
483,Spotify,Parimal Pratyush,1,0,"I subscribed to the premium services with the view to not have to subscribe to any other music services. In fact, cancelled my YouTube premium bundled with YouTube music. I had absolutely no doubts that spotify would be free from general icky issues. But what do you know? Mainstream artists missing, sucky remixes of popular songs being offered instead. Coldplay, Charlie Puth and many other missing. I wanted an authentic music app not a sucky remix app."
484,Spotify,Tom Deverson,4,1,Best music app in the world at the moment imo. But on my Samsung s9 the lock screen controls just don't work with spotify. I don't know why. Tried a lot of different methods to fix it and nothings changed.
485,Spotify,Amit.s Shalat,1,0,Many songs are still not available in India. Now i feel why i subscribed to premium and wasted my money!!! Amazon music is way better....
486,Spotify,lucas daniel souza de medeiros,1,3,"Shuffle mode is turned ON always. The support was fast and great, but like a bot. told me: uninstall and reinstall bla bla. But the problem is on code of app. The default mode on any new playlist is shuffle."
487,Spotify,N Morris,1,8,"Please fix the rotation problem, it's been broken for months. It's very confusing the have scroll up and down instead of left and right. Also, because it keeps switching to portrait mode, so do the volume controls, so left up and right is down ðŸ¤” Spotify - helping to confuse drivers around the world, great job ðŸ‘"
488,Spotify,Sophie,2,12,"so I love spotify for what it is but there are some real problems with the functionality of the app. first of all it keeps taking ages to load things second the recent update changed the layout and it makes no sense, the recently played isn't as organised a history, playlists are hard to find-either have them alphabetical or in or in order of creation and I cant find saved music from artists I follow. I want to be able to see the specific albums I've saved not the artist page all the time"
489,Spotify,Erwin Anthony NaÃ±es,4,0,"still don't understand how I can place family members under my plan, so my wife and I are separately paying for Spotify, which sucks. all previous attempts to do this have failed. apart from that spotify is cool"
490,Spotify,Cecilia Cat,4,0,kills off all my data but I get guys need to make money. Overall good ðŸ‘
491,Spotify,Alison Vaz,4,0,quite a good music app dis 1 I found after a long while... it's refreshing and the background even is nicee.. only thing is it lags at times bt dats occasionally...
492,Spotify,Kris Hansen,4,0,great app! This app has broaden my music taste substantially! although I wish it was cheaper. if they could knock it down to 6$ or 7$ a month i would give 5 stars. Free hulu is a nice touch.
493,Spotify,Mario Navarro,4,0,"Spotify is great. Easy to use. Current problem is with the radio stations. I can not dislike songs that I do not like, and when i like a song they do not appear in my ""liked from Radio"" playlist. please help"
494,Spotify,Luke Frymire,4,0,Great when it works. There are some bugs on my Galaxy S9 - when I click on an artist it sometimes comes up blank until I press back and click again. Sometimes it takes multiple tries.
495,Spotify,Cap Shades,1,0,"Best music streaming app. But some guys like me hate to see hindi songs in our feed, so if you are kind to add a option to select music genera, it will be highly appreciated. It will give more room for personalisation."
496,Spotify,Maganjot Singh,2,11,"Spotify, why with every update I'm able to access lesser music. I'm unable to access the Music from Charlie Puth, Ed Sheeran, etc. what's the use of Spotify if we can't access it equally?"
497,Spotify,Jamie Troy,2,23,"I used to love this app, especially for my ride to work, but for the past week or so it's been absolutely terrible. It freezes in the middle of a song and plays songs I've deleted. It's becoming such a pain in my a** that I'm strongly considering deleting all together, which is a shame because it was my go-to for music and one of my favorite apps. Please get your s**t together."
498,Spotify,Justin King,1,0,I pay my bill and have unlimited data yet I still can't access songs. Isn't the point of paying for premium to have unlimited access?! F@(kin' C_nts!
499,Spotify,Abhay Chitta,5,4,"Best experience for music. Most if not all the songs are in this app which includes the less popular ones. You are easily able to use the many if already created playlist or create your own. Highly recommend to get premium-$9.99, especially if you are a heavy listener to music. You can download songs and choose your own song instead of shuffle play. In addition you have access to high quality (320 kbps) music."
500,Spotify,Zsombor Miszlai,1,0,"Thinking about canceling my subscription. The search function when you swipe up anywhere disappered! Now it's 2 clicks away and search is also not really efficient in finding anything in my music! This is very annoying. It's getting worse, the even if you search and go back, the initial search disappears. It keeps playing the same song on shuffle it keeps stopping while its clearly set not to, it keeps opening on windows although it's clearly set not to. I'd give 0 star if it would be possible."
501,Spotify,Andrew Mace,5,0,"newest update for some reason is crashing after a few seconds. cleared cache, removed and reinstalled...nothing....went the nuclear option and completely factory reset phone believing it was my phone and it was still not working....... turns out it's the sd card? i couldn't reformat or delete anything in it, looked fine .... took hours to figure it out.... ejected it, Spotify seems fine now?!"
502,Spotify,Ismaeel Ismaeel,1,1,I haven't and wouldn't ever use a more disgusting ðŸ˜¡ service!! It's just awful in every way! I only get 6 song skips! Shame on you!!
503,Spotify,Devansh Gupta,3,0,Why is there no 'repeat' button in the player?! How can you exclude something so basic? Disappointed. ðŸ˜•
504,Spotify,jack gibson,4,0,I love this app its brilliant but i wish there was a system where (on phone) they didnt put songs that they think i would like. Unless thats a thing and im dumb.
505,Spotify,Mark Ogles,4,0,"I have been real happy with Spotify. So there I just tooling along saving albums making playlists, etc. then i get this message telling me what an awesome collection i have made but if i want to save anything else I would have to delete something first. No other options, just that one choice. I mean come on folks. Isn't just a list after all. So just be aware that there are limitations to the service. Also they keep putting music I don't play in my hard rotation list and genres I don't listen to."
506,Spotify,ESCAPES ESCAPES,4,2,"there's no repeat button. please put it back again. also, there should be a timer button which would switch off the player automatically..people are ready to go premium but it should have the basic features of a music player. And want to thank Spotify for exposing me to some too good songs which i'd have never listened to otherwiseðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜‹"
507,Spotify,Jon Rebello,2,0,"seriously, as much as I used and love and also appreciate this app..... you could not make it more confusing or impossible how to pay ones subscription fee!!! why throw so many reminders to a subscriber's way and then make it so challenging to pay for said subscription? I click on my profile icon thing and it's like, do you want to share over Instagram or Facebook or messenger or blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah......"
508,Spotify,Phil McCartney,1,6,The new UI is not user friendly if you tend to download individual songs instead of entire albums. Contacted Spotify to explain this but they were less than interested in the feedback.
509,Spotify,Chris Norris,5,2,"What happened? Now the app constantly crashes and is always very buggy. 
Terrible. Switch to Tidal people. Spotify is quickly going down hill"
510,Spotify,Meli S.,1,0,not sure which update it was but I no longer have my artist list in alphabetical order. I have to now follow each artist and that ends up showing ALL there songs when I go to said artist versus going to said artist and listening to the few songs I like that I saved. very inconvenient.
511,Spotify,keegan hubler,1,7,Yall are so close. I can organize my music by the artist now but I'd still prefer a list of just artists. Dont ask me to give you 5 stars when your app is still broken.
512,Spotify,Danne Dittrich,5,1,just got Spotify yesterday and it worked great so I got premium and now app won't even open................ As a previous business owner I know there are alway glitches and catch that screw things up. What show a GOOD business is how you answer and fix these issues. Spotify responded very quickly and had a fix for my problem immediately. To me that shows a good business.
513,Spotify,edward leen,5,0,Taking too much time to load! Feels very glitchy! it's not issue of Internet or phone! I use Asus Zenfone max pro m1
514,Spotify,Garry Singh,5,2,"I've been using these music apps for the better part of the past decade and i also have been using apple music I must say , Spotify truly spoils you not just with its collection but also its playlists. The playlists are to good, u just don't have to worry about constantly remembering names for the next song as long as its from the same kinda music genre. I would strongly recommend everyone to just try it out once for themselves."
515,Spotify,Travel with Niruz,2,0,App crashes when using bluetooth headsets. Song plays and stops in the middle. Hope they provide a stable update for s10+
516,Spotify,Isabelle J.R,3,0,this app is ok but it plays songs that aren't in the playlist it plays inappropriate adds and you only get 6 skips an hour. I like that you can play your own music but it suggests songs that might not be appropriate and if your out of skips then you have to listen to them or swap playlists. It had has a good selection of songs and most bands are on there.
517,Spotify,Kasi M,3,0,"I love Spotify and I've been using it since I was in college about 5 years ago! I've never had problems with it but this a critical issue. Whatever the last update was, the music keeps stopping if I have my phone locked or the screen timeout activates. It's pretty annoying and now it's also affecting the Chromecast. It'll play a couple songs as normal but then it just stops like I stopped casting. Please fix this Spotify!"
518,Spotify,Matthew R,2,2,"Spotify is great but the app is trash. it locks and freezes up while other more demanding apps are fine. sometimes I need to wait 5 or more minutes before it decides to let me change what I'm listening to (or even play music) as a premium member i must say, the app is the biggest put off about Spotify."
519,Spotify,KiKi HNK,1,1,"cant skip over songs on playlist now. have to exit the app and try again and again befor it works... well that's old news. now it just wont work at all. I have to go into the app to skip, now the freaking volume is on the fritz with it. FIX THIS ALREADY!!!!!!!!! IVE HAD IT!!!!!!!"
520,Spotify,Martin Attwood,1,26,"I switched to Spotify after changing my car that has a native Spotify app. It's fine in the car but is not as good as Deezer at the basics. The auto volume leveling is not great with some songs being much louder than others, never had any problem with Deezer. The really annoying thing now is that the app has become completely unusable in that music stops shortly after my phone locks and judging by the comments on here, I'm not the only one. I shall be asking for a refund of charges until fixed"
521,Spotify,Office Marion,3,0,"dear developers: 1. allow for wider music taste and listen to all kinds of music styles not only one preference. 2. music taste preferences settings are so limited in paid version- why3. let me view lists not only album tiles. 4. let me see my saved lists, 5.let me customise what I want to see in home dashboard. 5. DONT give me music vocals when I search instrumental. 6. show me artists playlists, not personal users. 7. filter search music I want to hear only, based on my preference. thx. ðŸ˜€"

529,Spotify,samantha willis,5,0,Spotify premium is great for my long drives. I often drive between Vermont and Maine without a working radio in my car. Being able to create and download playlists that don't have ads is fantastic. It's nice to play music when I don't have service.
530,Spotify,Marley Juarez,4,0,Spotify is an amazing music app. all though I suggest the should fix the 6 skips per hour and to also fixed sedgestted songs from popping up on your playlist and when you skip that count on one of your 6 skips.ðŸ˜’

534,Spotify,Kristopher Juarez,4,0,"Been using since beta and currently have a premium family account. It's well worth paying for no ads, offline mode, and multiple members under one account. You can even log onto two devices and use one as a remote for the other. The app isn't perfect however. They make seemingly random changes that are hit or miss with users in general. Occasionally bugs pop up and they have a forums page on their website but it is lacking in searching for specific issues if the words don't match."

My playlists don't always start over and to get them to start over I have to restart my phone. the problems are getting worse every update is it gets any worse I'll just have to delete the app. honestly just get youtube music you can choose what you want to listen to with everything else you get from spotify
549,Spotify,Ryan,4,1,"I like Spotify though there is room for improvement.  For example, I think that that the service should offer info on the artists and albums we are listening to and discovering. Other than that I have no real issues with the service."
550,Spotify,Destiny Aikens,1,0,I had it connect to the speaker and now the speaker disappeared want be found at all. I tried to see if it will work few days later and still doesn't work
551,Spotify,kurianãƒ‰ãƒ‹ãƒ¼,2,0,"I love everything about this app, the UI, and its featutes and last fm scrobbling. But why do they have issues with record label for licencing in india when apple music, jio saven and other streaming service have no such issues"
552,Spotify,James Atlas,2,0,"music selection is good.. but sound quality isn't very good, app freezes and is at a crawling slow most of the time. Also no ability to create playlist out of podcast episodes"
553,Spotify,Jess Pletcher,2,0,"While I love spotify for its expansive library of music, the app itself is really poorly designed and maintained. I experience problems in the app on a regular basis, and have for years, across various devices. I wonder if, because they know they have (almost) a corner on the market being an app with this much music, they feel they don't have to make their product high quality. It's a big bummer."
554,Spotify,DarkDax12345,1,1,I love the app but these updates are taking away the things I like. I want to see how many songs are in my playlists and I want the quick add back. return these and I will give 5 stars
555,Spotify,Richard Job,1,752,The app sucks big time..! It is not allowing me to update my profile online and neither does it let's me login via app. Gives me this super stupid error message saying you can use the app abroad only for 14 days. I'm frigging from India and I'm very much here. If I log in via online mode I see that the country is set to France! And if I have to change the country it is not letting me update the profile. It says the email is already taken? What the heck is this?
556,Spotify,Lee Ludlam,4,0,"Just got a new phone, reinstalled app, app continuously paused, updated app, app still randomly pauses until you reopen and/or press play again. Great music selections! Please correct pausing issues!"
557,Spotify,Jacob Ball,5,1,Usually I love this apl but for some reason it won't let me open it. It keeps crashing as shutting down. I have restarted my phone and it's still not working.
558,Spotify,heartfelt fancy,1,0,"Fine until it gets pushy. When you use system notifications to advertise at me, fine. That's normal nowadays, and you need money. When you stop me from being able to dismiss those system notifications, you lose notification permissions. Any further, and you're uninstalled."
559,Spotify,Christian Morales,2,0,"My review was 5 stars, but had to change it because since last update the app crashes after every song, and I have to close the app and open it again. I tried clear cache, delete and reinstall the app, but didn't work at all. If this doesn't get fix I have no other option than deleting my account and finding a new app, which will be sad because i really like Spotify."
560,Spotify,Joseph Shipley,5,0,Best radio app yet! Great selection and sound quality!! I've cycled through all the apps and kept coming back to this! The only thing that could make it better is to introduce HiFi quality
561,Spotify,Marie S,5,0,The best music streaming app. You can download songs for offline use. The sound quality is top notch and they have a wide variety of artists. i listen to a lot of artists that arent well known and i have been able to find them all on spotify. the only upgrade i would ask is that you can customize the organization in your library. As in i'd like to listen to all of imagine dragons music based off of the order in which their albums were released.
562,Spotify,A Google user,1,1,"keep crashing all the time it's getting a bit boring now. premium user, worked fine until mid last year. will not pay for it again."
563,Spotify,Alexa Charmley,2,0,good app. lots of songs but it signs me out weekly now and I have to uninstall and reinstall and redownload my 800 song playlist. it's getting annoying now.
564,Spotify,Wacey Begay,3,0,"Okay. I f*cken love spotify & use it everyday. BUT, the recent update (Mar.2019) messed up the album display & I believe they just dumbed it down. I really liked it before & now when I see the new album display everytime I open it, im just like ""ugh"". lol AND would you please make an option to customize our playlist songs already?! (would be nice to move music around and customize it the way we please, because i have plenty of dope playlist but the way i added the songs are effed up.) lol"

566,Spotify,Jovan Wilson,5,1,"It don't get no better than Spotify musically. I wake up to it go to sleep to it, workout to it, and perfect for making babies...lol I also play soft sounds from the ocean to sleep"
567,Spotify,Marielys Delgado,3,4,I actually thought that by paying for this app would be better than regular but it really isn't. the only upside about it is that you can listen to music offline. thats it. I wonder that if the company actually reads this could take in consideration that whenever I download an album some songs download and others don't. which really bothers because I'm paying so I can receive the full package of what this app has to offer. nonetheless it's a good app I just wish it could work in a better format.
568,Spotify,Meowijuana 420x,3,0,Frustrating. Always interupts my music half way through for an ad. Or itll randomly skip songs. Better then Pandora but good lord does it leave something to be desired.
569,Spotify,Andrew Rodriguez,5,0,Spotify is the superior service plain and simple. customized playlists for you and the student plan is an amazing deal. I can't believs there are actually people out there that think apple music is better.
570,Spotify,adliya nindya,1,1,i can't share song to instagram story :( really disappointing. already try to uninstall-install both spotify and instagram but still no change. i paid for premium too but why can't i share the song which is basically the simplest thing ever :((
571,Spotify,William Fortier,2,0,"I love the ability to customize ad nauseum, but I'm having the same issue numerous others are right now. When using Bluetooth, songs pause unless you physically open the app (NOT safe to do while driving), and even then, it will probably get to the end of that song and then ""hang"" again. If this is what Premium will get me from now on, I'll be cancelling my subscription; I can get the same service elsewhere."
572,Spotify,Mo,2,0,Spotify keeps closing out and i have premium. I have the Google pixel 2 XL and I've never had this problem til now. No battery issues. I don't understand why its happening.
573,Spotify,Jaime Dahl,3,0,"They took away the swipe search bar in playlists again so two stars. The app would be 5 stars with it. The app is very intuitive, helpful for finding new music, and offers great quality streaming."
574,Spotify,Hannah Howard,1,0,You don't know what I want!! I do!!! So BACK OFF! Seriously. I understand that I'm not premium so go ahead and play some extra songs but don't play 2 songs from my playlist followed by 30 songs you picked. I put songs on a list for a reason.
575,Spotify,Aaron Davis,4,0,i love this app. the best thing to happen to me. but i have had some trouble recently with getting thown out after 20sec. i think you should have a customer service as well
576,Spotify,Victor Foschi,4,0,music is easy to download but I don't agree with having to pay money for listening to my music. the reason I don't listen to the radio id because there's too much talking and commercials. i just wanted to listen to music
577,Spotify,Bryan Wintermute,3,0,"Generally good, but the recent update makes it frustrating to use. I suddenly am unable to seek backwards anywhere but the app itself (i.e. Bluetooth controls or the lockscreen). Coupled with the annoying bug where it always resumes from your last position in a song (even when changing songs), the experience makes me want to throw my phone out the window. Other bugs also harm my ability to enjoy the app."
578,Spotify,Jeremiah Mcgrady,1,0,"No like or dislike button for premium users. If they bring that back I will come back to Spotify, but I want the option back.... help us out Spotify!"
579,Spotify,Rajarshi Biswas,4,0,"Excellent soundtracks, artist selections and daily mixes but you can't see your queue and you don't have complete control over it and you need to go premium (payed) for high quality sound and this app consumes outrageous amounts of data. It's one of the best music apps ( no doubt ) but it lacks in a few areas."
580,Spotify,ted m kamanzi,1,0,"you connect is very lacking. i can not connect to my tv, wich is sad. because i have been able to do it in the past. your update ""fixed"" something that wasn't broken and made it worse."
581,Spotify,John Smith,2,0,"Music spontaneously aborts and refuses to play + Lots of songs. + Some nice features -They are not adding much needed features like: Song Specific Listening History, Bin (to recover accidentally removed songs), Light theme option and many other useful features. -Sometimes the app sais there is no internet connection when there is and then refuses to search for songs, artists etc."
582,Spotify,Zach Evers,1,0,DOWNLOAD SOUNDCLOUD INSTEAD YOU WILL HAVE A BETTER EXPERIENCE. to start with was great. untill spotify stopped giving me premium and did not cancel payments. i am fuming... spotify please contact me. i do not recommend. DOWNLOAD SOUNDCLOUD INSTEAD
583,Spotify,jose valentin,1,0,"I have a galaxy s10+ and the appruns terrible. It's slow when searching and slow when playing songs when compared to other streaming services. I don't know what they did but I've never had this much trouble before with the app, it use to be fast and reliable, but now I can't stand it. It just takes forever to search or close the app. HELP"
584,Spotify,FortyFive,3,0,"Premium is super affordable, but the newest update made sorting playlists a pain by putting almost all options in the slow three dot menu. Also there needs to be an easier way to see if a song is already added in one of our playlists."
585,Spotify,Rebecca Jones,2,0,"If I'm paying at bit more than $10 for an app I would hope it wouldn't freeze and buffer so much! I'll open the app and try to play something but all I'll see is a black screen attempting to load the home screen. Once it's running I may get a few songs to play but then I'll lose connection, even though my internet connection is fine, and I'm greeted with silence. Why does Spotify run so badly on Android? I just got a Galaxy S10 and was hoping it would run better but nothing changed!"
586,Spotify,Samantha Laspe,1,0,"Since the the latest upgrade my music life has been shite. I now don't have a library, thinking of leaving spotify you really needed to think about your upgrade it's not helpful in the least. All my music I spent time downloading is gone. I am a premium member."
587,Spotify,Bear Run,5,2,"The best music app I have ever used. I have been using it for years on premium now and only have positives. non-premium does contain annoying ads, but honestly for only 10 bucks a month its worth every song you could ever imagine."
588,Spotify,Amber Smith,1,0,"The app used to be great, but now it constantly stops. I cannot even restart it to get it to work. So frustrating and I'm ready to cancel my subscription at this point."
589,Spotify,Fatema Akbar,5,0,A great music app! love it! i use apple music and consider switching my only problem is that i have over 2000 songs on my apple music subscription and downloading them all again would be a pain in the begind
590,Spotify,Sprink,4,0,only issue is when it hangs up and doesnt load anything. as though its frozen or crashed.
591,Spotify,A Google user,5,0,unable to access play queue view in the app. you can add to queue but no viewing or editing. button in bottom right of play screen is unresponsive.
592,Spotify,Orange Wrecker,1,23,"Ridiculous. I don't understand why younger people are so into it. This app completely ruins and demolishes good music with these ""Remastered"" versions that it tries to shovel into your ears. The application may be good for someone with mediocre taste in modern music. However, for those with good taste in classics, 50s, 80s, etc. We are out of luck. Half of the music is ""Remastered"" to sound like garbage. I'll step back and let teenagers swallow that junk."
593,Spotify,G B,5,0,paying customer here. after 2 or 3 months i started paying. i never listen to the radio. i listen to music i want to hear. i listen to some real off the wall stuff somtimes. and its always here. and whole albums. its siiiick. the app always works. i can pull out of my driveway from my wifi and it seamlessly switchs to data no problem. no contrats. easy. rock on!
594,Spotify,Jaden Steele,3,0,"The app is pretty good. It sometimes takes forever to load. Also, I don't care about the ""behind the lyrics,"" but I would like to see ONLY the lyrics for every song."
595,Spotify,Louise McDonell,2,1,Despite listening to constant ads about being able to skip ads - I cannot. The last two updates haven't fixed this issue. I haven't been able to skip ads in the app ever and now I can't skip on my BT headphones or in the car. Please fix this issue.
596,Spotify,krissy brewer,3,11,"haven't tried others, but this is limited. on my computer i can go through my play list however i want. on my tablet and phone i can only do shuffle. i haven't tried other music apps so i don't know if they're all like this but it's super annoying. but I'm kinda too lazy to refind all my music. and i use my phone more than my iPod."
597,Spotify,Peyton Stille,1,0,I love Spotify and have been using it for years. I got a new Chrome book and the app won't work. I open it up and it's just a plain black screen. I'm very disappointed.
598,Spotify,Avantika Rajeev,4,0,"lets be honest here, this app provides the best quality music. I am glad that it has been launched in India. However, some songs are not available. Please take care of this issue ... also please see to it that we can change our profile when needed. And this is surely a 5 star worth app if these issues are taken care of"
599,Spotify,Prateek Joshi,5,0,"It was so satisfying that always refresh your mood and gives you strength when you're broken.. Helps me to do work,sleep..i mean just.. I loved this app.. Using since 2011 on my first iphone ever!"
600,Spotify,Gimwell Young,4,1,"please make it easier to manage playlists, songs, filters, etc. Some inconsistencies exist as well-- there are times where downloading a playlist with a song from artist X, said song would not appear in the 'artist' section and more."
601,Spotify,Melody Alilin,1,0,i hate the new update. bring back the old one. why change what is not broken. so pointless
602,Spotify,Sarah Scott,5,0,"Spotify is one of my favorite music apps; but I have run into a recent issue- after I ended my free 60 day trial, spotify has been set to offline mode, and I can not find a way to turn it to online mode. I haven't been able to listen to music for almost a month now. and I miss it :("
603,Spotify,Nadine Nero,4,0,great range of songs. However would prefer better catering for family friendly options. E.g. not playing explicit songs when kids about or letting their music taste influence my discover weekly
604,Spotify,Christine Mae Avila,5,0,Spotify is one of the best apps ever invented. I don't think any another music app can live up to the great things this app offer its target users and the whole world.
605,Spotify,Jordan Kraubner,5,0,I use to love this app until recently. I can no longer skip or pause songs through any bluetooth device when my devices screen is off. Please fix. Problem has been fixed and is working great! Thanks.

607,Spotify,Kelly Grizzle,5,0,"Very good, easy to use, love that you can make playlist even using the free app. The list may not play in order but it still plays what you like."
608,Spotify,Matt Weber,4,0,"Spotify has it all... even super obscure artists. i love it. However, i wish they would incorporate full music controls for headphones like Google Music has."
609,Spotify,Shannon Woodrow,1,6,"Terrible updates - you can no longer see your song list sorted by artist through any applications (Android or PC). To see an artist in said tab, you must be following them. I hate that you can't sort your music like this! Spotify is disappointing me more and more these days!"
610,Spotify,Michael L,4,0,good quality and has all my favourite artists. any issues that I've haf while using the app customer services was right on top of things
611,Spotify,Panda Copyright,3,0,"EDIT: Spotify has changed a little since I wrote this review. As much as I loved Spotify back then I had to lower the rating to 3 from 5 stars. Not cause of the phone app istelf since that works flawlessly. Shuffle tends to play only 50 or so songs from the playlist and Spotify stopped working on my pc for no reason. (tried clean installs) ORIGINAL 5* REVIEW: If you are willing to pay for Spotify premium it'd 100% worth it. If not, then you need to see how much you value ads in your music."
612,Spotify,Brett Easment,1,2,keeps pausing for no reason ever since the latest update come on fix this already or you guys are gonna lose alot of customers i really like Spotify but if this problem does not get resolved soon I'm gonna cancel my account
613,Spotify,Joe Delisi,1,2,Automatically adds songs to ur playlist and cant turn off. Horrible app
614,Spotify,o k,3,4,its glitchy and they keep taking things away from the app and adding very little for example the removed the hidden songs thing now i cnat even see my hidden songs smh. they changed the layout even though there was no problems with it this app is usable nothing above that right now i honestlly would of given this app a 4 or 5 if i had a time machine to travel back to 2 or 3 years ago. the spotify devs dont care about reviews and never take any thing a reviewer says to heart so this way useless
615,Spotify,Jody Kirton,1,0,"I hate that it adds songs to your playlist! I added the songs I like, then it adds ones that it thinks I may like. If I liked them I would have added them, so annoying deleting the app and cancelling my account because of this"
616,Spotify,Charlie,4,0,This is a perfect way to listen to music whether it be walking or just chilling. If you don't have premium sometimes the ads can get a little distracting and annoying but apart from that music quality is superb
617,Spotify,Cmpound,2,0,"I've been using spotify for 2 years now, and for the past few months my spotify has been lagging, crashing, and not functioning well at all. I also have a premium account so this is very disappointing and acceptable."

619,Spotify,Enhaw Wu,4,0,"Good app provides nice family plan. For some reason, the UI seems a bit change. I have a bit difficulty finding new music I want and end up looping in the similar album and artists that I listen previously."
620,Spotify,Lyrically Faight,5,0,I have been using this app for over 5 years and I have loved every version and alteration. This app is great if you know what your music taste is and want to listen to just that. It also has a great radio function and Spotify and user made playlists if you're looking for new music.
621,Spotify,parshow jyoti Phukan,4,0,I wont give 5 stars because you don't have any playlist for Iron Maiden. like seriously you missed out iron maiden? you really missed out iron maiden?
622,Spotify,A Google user,4,4,"This app is great, but it's too difficult to edit playlists, find songs in search for songs in playlists, and when a podcast is tapped on, I often need to spend ages scrolling to find the episode that I'm up to because it will be stuck on an episode that it mistakenly thinks that I haven't finished yet."
623,Spotify,Neal Ryan Caballes,1,2,"After the recent updates, Spotify on Android is officially broken. This is obviously and annoyingly not optimized for Android! The loading time takes forever, and the transition from one page to another, most especially in the ""search page"" and in ""the recently played section"", has some major hiccups. What a waste!ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¤¬"

626,Spotify,Leea Raach,4,0,"The limitations for free version are not too bad and the Music recommendations are chosen very well. Sometimes your ""Made for you"" Playlists dissapear (I had 5 Daily Mixes and now only have 2, one of them is only accessible sometimes)"
627,Spotify,El Rey Del Mundo,3,2,"interface is overly simplistic and almost makes it seem as if theres nothing. also, they need to keep a consistent home screen, cus sometimes the ""your top podcasts"" section is the second row and then sometimes it's not even on the home screen and I have to search for it after scrolling all the way down. Then the your top podcasts section is half podcasts I've never listened to and the Joe Budden Podcast is pretty much 70% of my entire spotify listening experience yet sometimes it disappears."
628,Spotify,Logan Robinson,1,2,"I got signed out while in offline mode.. I tried to sign in but it said you must be online, which I cant change until i sign in.. its an endless loop. Fix this."
629,Spotify,Triston Gervais,1,3,"Still one-star. Refuses to load my library most of the time, constantly crashes, have to force close to reset and even then that doesn't work every time. Uninstalling/reinstalling doesn't help at all."
630,Spotify,Matthew Weathers,2,0,"Excessive Battery Drain I use this application daily while working. Recently the app has started to consume large amounts of battery life (23% just today after being off the charger for 6 hours, but only 1 hour of listening), much more than screen time. I have many playlists downloaded for offline use and am a Premium subscriber. It is hard to understand what is the culprit when nothing is downloading or streaming and the app is in offline mode."
631,Spotify,Ashley Taylor,1,56,"I can no longer rewind or fast forward 15 seconds via bluetooth no matter what device I use. Instead the entire podcast replays or skips to the next one. This is very inconvenient while driving because I used to be able to rewind 15 seconds from my steering wheel. Please fix this. And the podcasts take forever to load. Why would I pay ""premium"" for something that is so crappy and does not work?"
632,Spotify,Jillian Littlejohn,5,0,"Spotify is life. From beats to work to, podcasts to learn from, hype music for the gym, chill music for relaxing with friends.. there's a playlist for that. You'll find your new favorite music you wouldn't have found otherwise."

634,Spotify,mathew trevis,5,3,"It's gotten very annoying listening to explicit songs, as in you get to 
choose to play song that are explicit or not, but if you choose to listen 
they still cut it out pointless and very frustrating"
635,Spotify,Kushagra Verma,3,1,overall the app is good..music quality is very fine..but it has a drawback. It doesn't have the repeat option..kindly add the it in next update...and add option for lyrics too..
636,Spotify,Aoife Hughes,1,3,"Since updating on S10+, songs will not pause from lock screen buttons. Have to open and enter app to pause. Also songs pause sporadically when screen turns off on phone. APP DOES NOT WORK! It keeps stopping. not worth paying for at all."
637,Spotify,Bhavya Singh,4,0,Great song reccomendations and playlists but there are some issues which need to be dealt with if this service want to become a succes in india atleast i would not switch my premium primary music service from google to this yet as some of the latest and trending songs are unavailable. can't connect to home app as my default music service hence no support on my google home smart speakers
638,Spotify,Sinead McHutcheon,4,0,"Love it. Only gripe is that I can't access my account settings through the android app, I have to log in to my account through a browser to update account information, hence the 4/5. Fix that and it's a 5/5."
639,Spotify,Amia Arts,5,0,"Okay best music app. You can play any songs unlike certain apps, (*cough soundcloud cough*) but if you want to play offline you need premium, which is better than not being able to play songs at all with out premium lile on soundcloud. Which makes life easier if you can't get premium."
640,Spotify,_Dewey,3,0,"I love spotify, its got almost ever song you can think of, the price is great, but man the android app keeps getting worse and worse with new bugs to it. The latest one has made it nearly impossible to use, evertime i go to open it, it has to log me in, with smart lock for some reason, then will work for about 5 seconds before it freezes and loads again. The only way I can get it to not crash is by turning offline mode on before it freezes. Otherwise in offline mode it works fine."
641,Spotify,Cariston Standish,4,0,"So.... what happened? This last update is pretty bad Seems to have completely lost screen lock control functionality. Won't let me rewind or fast forward songs from my lock screen now, and it won't let that function work when I have it connected to my car's bluetooth so if I want to skip or rewind a song, I have to unlock my phone and then open the app. Completely defeats the hands free purpose of connecting to bluetooth. Also, y'all must want me to get in a car accident by doing that. sweet."
642,Spotify,Octavian Cristea,5,0,"Even though it is Spotify and all, still has issues and crashes. I was expecting more"
643,Spotify,A Google user,1,6,Lock screen controls on Verizon S9+ latest version stopped working again. I'm tired of reinstalling an app for paid premium subscription multiple times. FIX IT!!!
644,Spotify,Israel Ochoa,3,0,my spotify keeps pausing when the phone screen is off. plays fine when the screen is on. just did update. hopefully it stops the pausing problem.
645,Spotify,MossyFooxX,5,0,"The music selection & Quality is great. My only complaint would be the ads, but even then ads don't interrupt your music, they play in between songs and quite rarely. Pretty Great."
646,Spotify,Shardul,2,535,"To get this out of the way, yes it does have all the songs you'd need for free, my problems are: I can't clear my queue; I can't delete songs from the queue; and, a major problem, the app simply won't disable auto-play on mobile if the playlist is fairly small. I googled all these problems, fiddled with the settings, reinstalled the app, nothing. If there are solutions, please, please tell me."
647,Spotify,CaramelloUK UK,1,3,When I first instled this app to my mini car it worked fine and I could skip backwards or forwards to the next track. Now after having to delete my device Huawei P20 Pro and then having connected it back to my mini since the updates it doesn't skip either way to the next track unless I use a USB wire??? What the hell is the point of having Bluetooth if you can't make it compatible to my car like it once was before some numpty decided that this was a genius idea... NOT!!! Please fix the problem!
648,Spotify,Briant Ly,3,0,"The service itself if good, but without getting Spotify premium (which I don't have), they just shove ads down your throat in the least subtle way possible. Most of the time, they just play 3 ads about spotify premium every 30 minutes, so they aren't even making advertising money from it, thus making the constant interruptions even more meaningless."
649,Spotify,Liam Rashid Da Savage,5,0,This gets my mind off bad things. It is a really good music app!

652,Spotify,Josh Heighton,1,0,This app needs some improvments. It crashes way to often and does things that you dont tell it. This app needs an update to fix these bugs. update** The clearly crashes more often than not. It also has trouble recently with bluetooth devices including my car. The app also stops working until reopened. please fix. Dropped from 2 star to 1 star.
653,Spotify,Eddie amerongen,1,0,Annoying shuffle play. Paid for premium still got advertising. Must be nice to get money from both ends.
654,Spotify,Zachary Williams,1,0,"Screw you spotify, give me back the rest the Stuff You Should Know podcast! I need their ample library of mundane information to get to sleep EVERY night! Not only do you not have Jay-Z and Tool, now this! One star."
655,Spotify,Justin Hu,1,3,"Quite disappointing when I was switching from one family to another, not only there's so much hassle to switch to another family account, my account also got 'demoted' to Spotify free even when I have successfully joined the second family, as my address is not the same as the owner, which did not inform me via an email at all and my account just got downgraded. If the owner could not remember the address keyed in, does that mean he need to cancel subscription again? I find it absurd!"
656,Spotify,Tyler W,1,2,"did an update and now it won't even open anymore, this isn't the first time it's happened so I'll just leave it at a one star until they want to take things more seriously"
657,Spotify,Abby Zimmermann,5,0,"Get this app! I totally understand that some people just don't want to be a member. If you don't like paying, but love quality, this is the right app for you!"
658,Spotify,Tanmay Adhikary,4,0,It is really a great app. The quality of tracks is awesome. I made a playlist there called Tony's Mood Makers. The app is quite easy to use. The only thing I wish that could be improved is that many songs are not available now in India.
659,Spotify,SHEETAL YADAV,1,1,"what is the use of having premium subscription if you cant even play songs of all your favourite artists like anne marie ,bebe rexha and indian 60s,70s,80s and 90s hit any many more . i know regret having premium membership"
660,Spotify,Paul Chalmers,3,0,Adverts seem much louder than the actual music. Yes you can pay to get rid of them but is it really necessary to be blasted out by an advert for vagicill when listening to the works of Vivaldi?
661,Spotify,Nick Bertot,5,0,I dont even remember how I listened to music before spotify. Paying for premium subscription is worth every one of my pennies.
662,Spotify,Millz,5,0,"Do we need one? I mean the ultimate thing would be that you could cue a whole playlist after one is finished or after a song or something mike that. Love Spotify, keep doing what youre doing."
663,Spotify,Joseph Mercer,4,0,"Samsung Galaxy S10+ Love the service, worth the price imo. Reinstalling solved my issues with SYNC. Lock screen controls don't work at all however."
664,Spotify,Dalton Manring,5,0,The best music app... even if you don't pay you can still make your own playlist and shuffle play your songs.
665,Spotify,Micah Ackerman,5,1,"Should come standard on all phones. I imagine only those new to life haven't heard of it, dont even know why I'm leaving a review."
666,Spotify,mewithoutyou138,5,0,"I love the premium option for letting you actually download all of your music so you can listen seamlessly even if you are driving through a dead zone for mobile data. But no complaints, nothing but good to say about this app."
667,Spotify,Jakiah Sutton,2,0,Why don't we have unlimited skips on phones but on chromebooks and computers we have unlimited skips? That's dumb.
668,Spotify,Julia Warner,3,14,"I love it, except the new change for skipping songs. It used to be really easy from the now playing bar at the bottom. Now it goes to a full screen. I don't need to see a pic of the album. I just want a simple skip arrow like before. It even does it from my lock screen. Please make it how it was."
669,Spotify,Veronica King,3,0,"Very disappointed with whatever update pushed through that eliminated the 15-second skip while on a locked screen. I used that feature very regularly & it's an unnecessary inconvenience, especially as a paid subscriber."
670,Spotify,Arjun Chatterjee,3,0,"The home isn't loading after the recent update, no matter how fast the Internet is. Kindly fix this. Rating will surely go up after bug fixes."
671,Spotify,Shauna Chiesa,3,0,"I love this app but the last couple updates have been awful. Songs just stop playing and don't start back up until you open the phone. there's also and issue with skipping and pausing songs, you can't unless if your phone is unlocked. it's especially annoying while driving."
672,Spotify,thomas prout,1,1,"This last update....music stops and you can't forward, go back or clear it. Premium is awesome...well, was. I am unable to save stations, also."
673,Spotify,Dakota Syme,5,0,"my favorite app. i still gave it 5 stars but one small issue there use to be a search bar at the top of my playlists, but now you have to go into settings andgo to find in playlist and then the search bar comes up. the other way was v much better."
674,Spotify,Mark Richards,1,9,"Can't log in anymore - it immediately logs me out then tells me that passwords don't match. Tried password reset several times - each time it tells me that new password has expired. Been a member since beta testing but just when I really needed it (27 hour coach journey), it has let me down. Looking for an alternative."
675,Spotify,Mysti Fickas,5,1,I absolutely love spotify! I get hulu free with my premium membership and I get to listen to all my favorite songs whenever on multiple devices that all are in sync with each other so I can pause on one device and then resume on a different device. Plus they give suggestions based on your listening history. I love the jazz they recommended for me. It's now my go to every Sunday morning.
676,Spotify,Terry Kishbaugh,1,0,"no good, stops playing for no reason, crashes. doesn't work on my galaxy watch.... they need to update the device compatibility to include gs10 and galaxy watch...."
677,Spotify,Ryan Mullane,5,0,Has been great but now it says there's no internet connection when on WiFi!!! Very frustrating!!!
678,Spotify,Lee Deville,5,0,i love have the entire discography of bands i like to hear the whole album. this allows me to dive into my favorite bands in a way ive never been able to before.
679,Spotify,Abhay Anil,1,0,the new update is totally unnecessary. You ruined a perfectly good app by adding some stupid security check that locks me out of my own account on the only device i use Spotify on. PLEASE FIX IT BEFORE YOU LOOSE SUBSCRIBERS.
680,Spotify,Ian Sabarros,5,0,"On premium plan I love it, on regular I can of hated it, but it did get the message through though. Great diversity of songs, I'd love to have even more Japanese music though !"
681,Spotify,Efrain Enrique Jimenez Guzman,1,0,"I'm sorry but ever since the ""Music - Podcasts"" update the app it's almost unusable and has lost more than half the functionality it used to have. Now when I add a song to my library I need to add it to a Playlist otherwise I won't be able to play it. I want to be able to shuffle between all my downloaded song like I used to, simple and easy. I'm sorry but I think I'm going back to Google Play music for now"
682,Spotify,Blue Panda,5,0,"When I was having problems for purchasing premium. Their was a support team. Their service was the best, they will patiently wait for your reply. And they really helped allot."
683,Spotify,Josh Gamble,4,0,"Just rejoined Spotify today with a 30 day free trial. I absolutely love the new UI. Just one thing though, i would love for the filter feature to be added back in where if you have a lot of songs in a playlist. I used this feature a lot and found it really helpful. When i saw that this feature wasn't in the app, i was a bit disappointed. But overall again i really like the new UI."
684,Spotify,me,1,0,i would have rated it 5 stars a few months ago but the last 2 or 3 updates have destroyed this app. the interface is terrible now. i dont think ill be paying for it next month. i rather buy all of the music i listen to on here and bust out my ipod video
685,Spotify,lockboy91,1,10,"Used to be good. now you put in an artist, and maybe once in a while you will actually get to hear a song by that artist! In the meantime you get to listen to a bunch of other songs by different artists who sound maybe a little bit like the artist you chose. You can't pick any particular album anymore either. it's like Spotify wants to become Pandora. Goodbye Spotify! It was good while it lasted!"
686,Spotify,Veronica Chiasson,5,0,love this after ive been hating on it for not being free.. after using it a few time and loving it.. i had to buy it. So worth the $10 per month espacially if you got small kids. LOTS OF DISNEY SONGS TO NURSARY RYMS.
687,Spotify,Hector Lozoya,1,0,loved this app before but now all it does is crashes I've had 30 crashes this past week and uninstalling doesn't work. I'm also a premium member and not sure if all this app crashing is worth it
688,Spotify,hyuna_lipnhip,4,0,I love the music and everything. it's great to listen to music but I don't got money and I'm about to just delete the app because of the disgusting ads. I don't wanna imagine kissing a French poodle or imagine eating toe nails
689,Spotify,Richard Tilley,1,0,Does not work with Pixelbook. Great on my phone. Best music streaming app I have ever had. I am a Primium user. It would be nice if it worked on my Pixelbook. There is nothing but a black void.
690,Spotify,Chaotic Gaming,5,2,"I'm a huge fan of music. I love Spotify due to the unlimited playlists you can make, the limitlessness of the playlists is amazing and there's always something new to listen to. I've used Spotify for years and I have had little to no issues with the app, nor do I have any issues with the Spotify Premium. Well worth the price if you're into music. I'd recommend it to everyone versus competitor music apps. From online to offline, Spotify Premium is the way to go, since you can download the music."
691,Spotify,Rachel Soulek,2,0,"App keeps crashing with the new updates. Can barely get through a single song if I'm in more than just Spotify on my phone; will also crash after awhile even if it's the only app in use. Very disappointed, as this is the only music app I use."
692,Spotify,Khushal Trivedi,3,0,this thing has bugs. I use this app on Samsung galaxy s8 and the music controls like play pause next and previous do not work on lock screen. The ad pop up in the app is not being dismissed nor it opens a new window when I tap on Start trial. Wherever I tap on the ad pop up the window upon which it has popped that responds to the touch or selection on the ad pop up. Please Fix this issue it really pisses me off!!!
693,Spotify,Nick Carabetta,4,0,mostly a great music service but lately have been buggy and frustrating to use. music won't download to phone and stops playing songs midway through
694,Spotify,Enrico Tizzano,2,1,"The problem with SD cards needs to be fixed! it's been ongoing for such a long time now, where Spotify keeps defaulting back to internal storage after phone restarts and software upgrades. So many users are reporting this on the community forums, so please fix it"
695,Spotify,Kyle Damron,1,1,DONT DONLOAD used to be great but now the music cuts out for a good 10 seconds multiple times in a song so it just awkward silence and you just lost a paid subscriber cause of this bug/glitch
696,Spotify,aza Kausar,4,1,Its really good for listening to your favourite songs and albums! I loved it since the first day i am using it! I would recommend you guys to download it! But i will give it 5 stars if you make an update where you can install some songs or albums to your device. But this app is still amazing! It is only 4 stars for now. keep up the good work!
697,Spotify,A Google user,4,1,i listen to music and podcasts but lately ive had trouble with my app. it will randomly stop playing music and wont buffer or anything unless i unlock my phone and go to the app. once im on tje app it will start playing again. please fix this i cant always be on my phone. edit: im about to terminate my premium sub with spotify if they dont fix the glitch. its super inconvenient.
698,Spotify,potato club,1,2,it is terrible i dont know what you did but its so useless like You added a Shuffle!? No it plays random songs that is not what yoy want and it is very very annoying!! ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜¡
699,Spotify,Delia-Dee Longey,2,1,"The app is great works well, the issues start once you go to premium service if your having billing issues ex. double billing to a card you can't find customer service. They want you to ask the community for help on tech issues ect very bad service any phone number you find isn't working or sends you to a survey or is disconnected. The family plan sends a code to those you invite, that invite goes to your account page where it shows that ex. you used Mastercard and last 4 numbers on card $$"
700,Spotify,Artorias Abyssal,3,0,"Good app for listening to music, but sometimes its suddenly stop playing music when I exited the app. I hope they can fix tht. And also hope they can bring more japanese artists"
701,Spotify,Heather Pitt,5,0,"This app is a fantastic way to listen to music, podcasts, even old comedy gigs if you wanted! If you dont buy premium the adverts can be brutal but it's not essential. Would definitely recommend!"
702,Spotify,littlecreatures,5,0,This app is really good if you want to listen to artist or idols that are from another country. the song recommendations are also nice. It is really smooth too. It have all the idols or artist in there so it is nice to listen to for example somgs that are so old you can still find it in spotify music I recommend this to the people that liked music. GREAT JOB!!ðŸ’•ðŸ’•ðŸ’•ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ–’ðŸ–’
703,Spotify,Stefan Naydenov,4,0,The new forced PORTRAIT mode of the main window is such a pain!!! Why did you do that?!?!?!?!? Also there's often a normalisation or EQ gap for a second between the tracks that can blow your head on a calm midnight quietness...
704,Spotify,Elaina Barker,1,0,"Listen to it every day. since the latest update this app has had issues. Skip is glitchy, pause also. I pay for premium and feel I'm being ripped off, will cancel if this continues."
705,Spotify,Chris Milson,5,6,"so I love spotify very much, have had premium for a really long time, my ONLY complaint is the favorite artists addition to the format. I much rather prefer going through the songs I did like from an artists opposed to having to skip through the ones I didn't like. please add a way to switch back to the old version!"
706,Spotify,Rajeshwar Telang,1,0,This app forces you to buy it. The advertisement never leaves the screen and you'll have to close the app just to listen those songs again. it might be a bug but it's a shrewd bug.
707,Spotify,Raushan Kumar,5,1,"I have been using since last 2 months and now I'm used to it. It really have good playlist and for free user like me, it has been totally good experience. I hope you will reduce few adds and not make it like youtube. ðŸ˜‰ For free user like me... This become one of my best app and i suggested this app into my circle and they all love it and sharing its experience to others too. Hope you will be like this forever. Thank you developers and all the sponsors of Spotify. ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„"
708,Spotify,Felicia Smith,2,1,The latest updates have completely backfired for my Note 9. I am no longer able to control music from my lock screen. I have read every forum possible. Uninstalled and reinstalled the app. I have changed every setting possible. Please fix this.
709,Spotify,Billy Cox,1,0,Latest update removed artist list from my music. Makes Spotify practically unusable. I used to love Spotify but I'm going to another streaming service now.
710,Spotify,Paddy Farrelly,1,1,"since the update my controls in the car via Bluetooth have become completely unresponsive, its a brand new bmw 118i and i csnt even skip a song anymore, very close to deleting this app and my account and cancelling my payments."
711,Spotify,AEKTA BHOJAK,1,1,"STOP ASKING ME TO TRY PREMIUM. I JUST WANNA LISTEN TO SOME MUSIC. LET ME STREAM IN PEACE. ALSO,WHEN I DO CLICK ON THE 30 DAYS FREE TRIAL OPTION,Y'ALL DON'T EVEN LET ME HAVE THAT TOO. HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO STREAM MUSIC WITHOUT THAT 30 DAYS BOX COMING UP? IT WON'T GO AWAY."
712,Spotify,Mark Teese,5,0,"great selection, great personalised playlists, worth the subscription IMHO. the app works well switching between multiple echo output devices. larger playlist management is still clumsy on the app, much easier on PC. Still, highly recommended."
713,Spotify,Christopher Frederick,2,7,"From time to time it skips songs automatically and it does so to a completely different genre (country to rap). this absolutely pisses me off and totally negates how easy it is to find songs and plays them on demand. Sometimes all it takes is a simple force stop and it stops skipping, however, the once a month occurrence having to uninstall then reinstall is why I will not give anything higher than two stars."
714,Spotify,Medha Nidhi,1,1,STOP FORCING ME TO GET PREMIUM this app won't allow me to dismiss the Spotify premium ads and it's annoying
715,Spotify,yoe,4,0,this is a great app to use if u love music very much and want to support your favorite artists. tho premium is a bit expensive.
716,Spotify,Patrick Dougherty,1,1,This app CONSTANTLY reverts my music off my SD card and back onto my Internal Device Storage to the point where my phone does not function properly. I constantly have to re-transfer thousands of songs. This is highly annoying.
717,Spotify,Tino Urias,5,21,"This app in my opinion is just phenomenal. I have all thisusic at my fingertips. I don't have to pay extra for albums or songs like some other apps or phones. I have the new-new what's poppin and I have that bangin old school!!!!!!! I can usually find whatever it is that I'm lookin for. Love this app, really don't know what I would change."
718,Spotify,Kayla Collier,2,0,downloaded and paid premium because i read an article about its functionality. but with the new update it is anything but functional. no song library judt playlists you have to maneuver. love the simple ability to be able to see all of your downloaded songs in one spot. why take that away?
719,Spotify,Dave Harris,5,0,"Spotify is number 1. I would recommend they fix the bug that randomly deletes all my downloaded artists, however, I'm sticking to playlists now to combat it. So they can have the 5 stars."
720,Spotify,Abhishek Anand,5,0,Great collection of songs and great playlists...The algorithm for playlist selection is good. Some popular international artists are yet to feature all their songs possibly due to label disputes...
721,Spotify,Drope,3,0,what happen to landscape mode in the player view? no matter what i do its now in portrate mode in that view. it would be great if that was addressed so i can use it again in my motorcycle. thanks
722,Spotify,JStyles0069,5,0,Love it better then other music apps but there one thing i hate and its the ads yeah i know i can buy the premium but still... it also it skips some of the tracks of the music i like but still a awesome app.
723,Spotify,Edward Barham,2,0,"I thought my issue was singular, but coming here, I see that it isn't. I gave up Pandora 6 years ago for Spotify, I liked the UI better, finding songs were easier, and I was considering going premium. This isn't happening now, the fact that I listen to music as I sleep (it calms my PTSD) but unless the phone is unlocked, it will stop playing after a song or two. It doesn't seem to be a settings issue. Nothing so far has worked. For now, going back to Pandora."
724,Spotify,hagas fagas,1,0,When my phone screen is off it pauses the music every 20s. It's not a device issue because this is the only app that does it. If there is no fix I will be canceling my subscription and uninstalling.
725,Spotify,Savannah Johnson,5,0,"I have used Spotify ever since it came out and I absolutely love it. The new student deal they offer is the best I have ever seen! I will never use another music app again. I am constantly finding new songs I enjoy based off of what Spotify picks out for me. If you dont have this app, you're missing out."
726,Spotify,David Lowe,3,0,"consider fixing your ad usage, I use more data on ads then songs nowadays, *plays 30 second ad* *10 seocond ad pops up, would you like to watch an ad for 30 minutes of ad free streaming?* *watches another 30 second ad* It gets on my nerves. other then that, this platform use to be really good."
727,Spotify,Clarence Williams,5,0,Good app. The shuffling of music is not good needs improvement. I should not hear the same songs in the same order everyday with over 500 songs downloaded.
728,Spotify,Gian Carlo Magdaleno,1,1,"The latest update for me deleted all my downloads and has no option of choosing a storage. I had it on my sd card but now, it only defaults in saving to internal storage not on the external storage (sd card)."
729,Spotify,Hilda Ortiz,2,1,I can't listen tight on my bluetooth app keeps going in and out very frustrated I uninstall and install back nothing
730,Spotify,Edoardo Puggioni,1,1,"The new library is terrible. For example, before I could play all the songs I saved of a certain artist, now there is only the list of saved songs by all artists. I'm paying Spotify premium and you don't offer a premium service."
731,Spotify,Brooke Isenberg,4,0,"I get music and Podcasts all in one place! I really like this app, I would absolutely love it if they could work that little bug out that keeps pausing my stuff."
732,Spotify,Kevin Krumwiede,2,0,"Great service, terrible app. Cluttered and confusing UI. Doesn't reliably start playing when BT connects or phone goes on hook."
733,Spotify,Rch Rch,4,1,"I don't know is it my phone only, but somehow the storage option is gone. I hope it's only bug, cause I really need that feature Edit: Thank you for bring back the storage option back, that saves a lot of (phone) memory"
734,Spotify,Ankush Reddy,3,0,Has become my most used app. amazing app. Still rating it 3 cause of the unavailable collection of music which is very frustrating
735,Spotify,Jana Lybarger,4,0,Sad I can no longer listen in my car on my phone's data. Still a good app for home and work but not being able to listen in my car anymore is a bummer. Premium is not an option for me.
736,Spotify,GamingWith Matthew,1,0,I HATE THIS!!!! WHEN I CLICK MY SONG IT WAS NOT THE SONG EVERYTHING I PICK IS A WRONG SONG!!!!! I HATE THIS !!!
737,Spotify,Tessa Whaley,3,1,"I've done everything I can to fix not being able to pause or skip songs while my phone is locked. it still shows my music on there but I can skip or anything, its annoying, especially when driving"
738,Spotify,Jenna Magnificent,3,0,"I pay for the service but often have difficulties connecting to the offline music despite it being offline listening being one of the perks. It's otherwise cool, though."
739,Spotify,EYMN/ YVE MARIE,5,1,It's the best music app whatever you want to search it's on their even some crazy name like calm love pop it's there it's truly amazing the new music kingdom lol. ~ 1/1;28/2018 *** still has the same opinion here. Literally #nevergonnagiveyouup on SPOTIFY
740,Spotify,oscar bourne,4,1,"I didn't give it 5 stars cause it lacks lots of songs and versions and covers but the app is great (no le doy 5 estrellas porque le faltan muchas canciones, versiones o covers pero la app estÃ¡ genial)"
741,Spotify,Master of Anime,5,0,"The app is great! It fits the taste for any genre, and if your sitting down bored and don't feel like listening to music, you can listen to a podcast!"
742,Spotify,Michael R,4,6,"Love the app! I've been using there service for years and even though I can't compare yo other music streaming providers this one is the best (especially for new music). Although... It would be better if you could add playlists to a queue, I was also familiar to the more action for adding a song to a playlist next to the song title (2 years that way), first time it changed i couldn't find it. Could really do with a way to add songs to a playlist in less steps."
743,Spotify,Hima Ganga,1,0,stupid ads. they show ads to ask us to pay them not to show ads. how ridiculous! uninstalled.
744,Spotify,Jovanni Orcullo,3,0,"Recent updates made this app from awesome to annoying. Constant freezes, loading times are longer now and the consistent bug that when you already paused a song or close the app that particular song is still playing."
745,Spotify,April Johnson,1,3,"it's been nearly a week and the same problem occurs, my songs stop playing out of nowhere while I'm listening. I'm canceling my account."
746,Spotify,Nabajyoti Das,5,0,Down and down on the list. When will we get all those favourite UNAVAILABLE songs that are AVAILABLE on ALL other services. You provide best recommendations. That's the only reason I'm here now. Wish more songs will be available soon.
747,Spotify,Jonathan Grams,4,0,"I primarily use the app for podcasts, and lately my lists have been resetting to Episode 1, causing me to have to scroll a bunch to get back to where I'm at. A pretty minor problem, though."
748,Spotify,Remi Carter-Slavin,5,0,I'm loving listening to all my old favorites for free. It doesn't get better than that. Thank you Spotify xx
749,Spotify,Kara Danvers,4,0,This is a great app. I'm willing to pay premium for better quality music but the downfall is that you cannot update your profile on the android app or delete recently played playlists. I would really appreciate an update that will allow updating your profile and deleting recently played playlists/artists on android.
750,Spotify,bocm3,5,0,This app is basically Pandora and Youtube music combined into one amazing app! The ads are a bit annoying sometimes but other than that its an amazing app to use of you just want to listen to the music you like
751,Spotify,rudy bellens,3,1,"Since I switched from my galaxy 7 edge to a galaxy S10 +, Spotify became much slower and keeps on hanging and freezing. Should I uninstall and reinstall Spotify or could there be another reason?"
752,Spotify,baubachoba,4,1,"solid app but needs some polishing okey spotify we all know its the best but ; Â°when you skip/slid through any track , its not responsive u need to click on the time line / music bar {â–¶ï¸ ----------â¯ï¸â®ï¸â­ï¸} this thing to skip through music Â°Basic music settings are trash u neeeeed to use the equlizer Â°i'm broke so i have the free v version so the as are irritating not the fact that 2 ads play one after one but the fact that they are badly constructed / directed bad voice acting dats alflks"
753,Spotify,Laney Macvicar,1,1,"Will not play continuously. After every song, I have to get back into my phone and open the app back up to get it to start playing again. I tried leaving the app open but it still stops after every song. Please fix this!!!!!"
754,Spotify,Zachary Barraiult,3,0,"Spotify has, for the most part, been my go to music app when I want to jam out. But in the last year the playlist creation has become so inconvenient to navigate on the app, you can no longer select to add all of an artist or album to your play list, you have to go through and add each song one by one. Thankfully last I checked I can still make a playlist pretty smoothly using my computer, but it's quite annoying if I don't have access to my laptop."
755,Spotify,Deserae Bryant,1,0,Lost too many features in the new update. I am changing my review from 5 stars to 1. I've been a premium member for many years and have now lost features that I used daily. So many features that I don't even want to use it anymore. Looks like Hulu might be taking it over... it's always sad to see a great service go.
756,Spotify,Danny Ray,5,1,ðŸ’¥SPOTIFY HANDS DOWN IS THE BEST!!ðŸ’¥ Have premium member for 2 yrs now and got my family on board too kuz its such a awsome mudic streaming service the best ever.and the family deal is such a great deal ..VERT HAPPY WITH SPOTIFYðŸ˜œðŸ˜‹
757,Spotify,James Butler,5,1,"Started having problems with songs randomly pausing. This is an especially frustrating, nearly app breaking bug. My stars will continue to go down, and my membership will end if this isn't fixed."
758,Spotify,Amir Mohammad Kamalo,3,0,"This app has a nice design and does it function of streaming music very well, but my problem is that I can't download the music in my SD card. My phone has limited internal storage space and this app causes my phone to run out of space."
759,Spotify,Jullian Temple,2,0,"The app needs a major overhaul. The app crashes and freezes a lot. Also liking songs can be a pain because they're duplicate songs for some reason and sometimes you end up adding the same song twice. Also is it too much to ask to see the runtime of a playlist/number of songs? I can't find that feature anywhere, they say swipe left but my playlist has one page."
760,Spotify,Dawn Horsfall,5,1,"froze all apps. so I uninstalled it. waste of time. now my tablet works better. Google play music is better,which I pay for. goodbye spotify."
761,Spotify,Josia,1,2,2nd Update: offline search is broken again. Mayor updates constantly break things. You are pretty bad at testing the app before a release!
762,Spotify,Ethan Hurst,5,1,"best music app. Stations could use a little work. Better format for everything but pandora has better stations for listening to ""alike"" artists but i spotify is the best"
763,Spotify,S y d 1 0 1,3,6,"The app is great and all but I just don't get why you have to pay for something you should have when you first get the app. Like can we listen to our music without being interrupted by another song that wasn't on the list, or having to listen to songs that aren't enough in the order you want them to be in. It just doesn't make sense at all. Also I COULDN'T SKIP the song I DIDN'T PUT."

765,Spotify,Keith Mishne,1,2,horrible! why have you spineless nerds deleted my review? is it bcause you cant address the malware issue that makes your repetitive 'shopee' voice advert play whenever it wants?
766,Spotify,Stuart Branch,2,0,"constantly having songs and playlists appearing on my family premium subscription. These issues have been reported constantly but do not get the issues resolved, also I have a different person's name on the account even though its registered to my email address. I'd not recommend this service, they take your money however customer support is poor to non existent!"
767,Spotify,Terrarian Master,5,1,really good don't cost any money unless you want premium with no ads unlimited skips and and needs no wifi or data to use
768,Spotify,Keith Perks,5,0,"Best music platform ever! I used to be an avid Pandora fan, but now I just feel sorry for anyone using anything but Spotify!! Highly recommended!"
769,Spotify,Brandon Darnell,3,0,been kinda glitchy as of late. I've had spotify for almost 9 years and the last year or so it hasnt been as good.
770,Spotify,Kate benwell,1,0,"Even after a load of updates my app still doesn't work. It freezes, refuses to load or just randomly decides to play music when it does feel like working. I pay Â£15.99 a month for this terrible service"
771,Spotify,Vara Lakshmi,1,0,"I like this app very much and the interface looks good but the problem is with the advertisements they are coming too often. They are 30 sec long and making interruption while listening. So , Please decrease the advertisements they are your app promotions so by decreasing them you can't be affected financially."
772,Spotify,Ryan DeVogel,3,0,"i love Spotify, have been using and paying for it for years (since it came to the US) i recently bought a new vehicle and much to my dismay (and this apparently an ongoing issue) the song titles do not refresh when the song changes when connected via Bluetooth, any phone that is Android 8.0 or newer. very frustrating. Phone: Asus ROG Phone (Android 8.1) vehicle is 14 Cherokee Trailhawk with Uconnect 8.4 w/ nav"
773,Spotify,Iliyan Sharif,3,0,Unavailable songs in India. I am a premium user and it's disappointing to see that so many songs are greyed out! The songs from artists like Sodom are very limited. I would like if this lawsuit problem is settled as fast as possible. ~I'll edit my review and give 5 starts after the problem is solved.
774,Spotify,Arun Sharma,5,0,"Truly awesome. I was sitting on the fence , thinking of downloading this for very long time. Then when I downloaded, experience have been truly fantastic. Highly recommended. Go for it."
775,Spotify,Pepper Gore,3,0,use to be great. but since the last update constantly starts and stops on it's own while streaming in my car. wish this could fixed. otherwise it would be 5 stars
776,Spotify,Mrinmoy Assam,5,0,"Awesome experience with this app. I got superb audio streaming quality on this app compare to the others also I like the music collection too much,But still some songs are missing as well as some languages are not available here.But it's not a major problem. I want to say only ""I LOVED IT"""
777,Spotify,Rahil Jain,3,1,waiting for the Warner music thing to get settled. also the latest content isn't being pushed much
778,Spotify,Ken Wade,5,0,I listen to spotify because it allows me to make a good playlist and spotify also suggests bands and music I an unaware of. You can select and discover a larger music experience without buying something you don't want !!
779,Spotify,K D,3,0,The queue is strange... can't simply queue tracks on the end of the queue. it always adds them after current track. Also every day Spotify automatically turns on shuffle which drives me crazy.
780,Spotify,Monique BRIEN,1,0,It's absolutely annoying when ads come on also I can't choose which song to listen so I have to shuffle play. After skipping six songs you have pay 10 pounds a month.
781,Spotify,Jonathan Vital,1,0,"This was really good until the latest updates. alot of freezing to constantly have to close the app to get it work. Am I'm pretty close to cancelling my subscription if this doesnt get fixed. imagine driving, listening and it stops. now forces me to pull over or try to fix it on the move potentially getting into an accident. Phone: S9+"
782,Spotify,Zofia Doolin,1,0,"I've used it alot for years and it was good, I have a subscription for 6,99 a month but for last few days I can't login to my app. I've tried to uninstall and install again but it doesn't help. Looking at the reviews below I'm not the only one with this issue so hope it will get fixed."
783,Spotify,Alan Guy,4,0,"very nice looking interface however would be nice to show an album view when clicking into an artist or have the option to view all to save scrolling through a long list of songs, also the controls on my lockscreen (s10+) dont seem to work at all.. other than these two points its a very good app."
784,Spotify,Pugalover's Amazing World Of Barbie,4,4,"I love this app but if you don't have premium it can be hard to use, here's why, If you want to play one song it brings up a while radio you have to listen to and it kinda gets annoying. Another reason is you have to listen to ads just every time you listen to something so if you reading this please fix this."
785,Spotify,Neville Hadfield,2,0,"it was great, since updating my android I've had sooooo many bugs, music stops playing, podcasts rewind to a random point with no way to find where I left off. super annoying. I keep updating spotify in Hope's that there's a fix it's been months and nothing... it might be time to find another source."
786,Spotify,Shane Higgins,3,0,"I used to say this was an easy 5 star app. Ever since I got the S10, this app consistently crashes. Premium almost isn't worth it anymore. Please fix and it will be an easy 5 star rating."
787,Spotify,FRIENDLIES,5,0,"10/10 music app, commercials aren't really annoying, only thing to say is please move the ""hide this song"" button to somewhere not right above the add to playlist button. I've hit it countless times and it's quite annoying to have to go find the song you were just listening to just to unhide it."
788,Spotify,Matt Storey,2,0,Ive dropped my rating after this last update as it has completely ruined the navigation experience for me. I listen to a lot of my own playlists and albums and often will listen to the same 3 or 4 playlists but the recently played section moves everytime I open the app leading to a lot of wasted time and frustration searching for it. Now I'm greeted with a load of playlists curated for me which I have absolutely no interest in. Utterly terrible new UI for me I'm afraid...
789,Spotify,Khriz 134,2,1,"Since the Last couple of updates I havent been able to background listen. If I go to another app then music will stop and if I press ""Play"" then it would restart the song. Let it play and does the samething. Fix it PLEASE!"
790,Spotify,Keertesh Kapadia,4,0,its great to find local unknown artsists as well as songs that aren't mainstream. also very good for top 40 and different genres
791,Spotify,Anya Mystrova,2,0,"it used to be a great app, but the changes suck. i personally like to be able to just select my music from the playlist, so the shuffle play thing is really really annoying."
792,Spotify,Siddharth Devaraju,4,0,"Hands down BEST MUSIC STREAMING SERVICE EVER! Whether it's free or premium, you will have a great time with it. I normally don't listen to podcasts so I don't know how podcast experience is like. But that's not why I'm rating it only 4 stars. This app deserves a 5 star but the only problem is there are so many songs that I love so much that are not available yet. It's still not a problem as 90% of all the songs I need are on Spotify. I somehow manage the other 10%..."
793,Spotify,Tonie Tinsley-Bennett,5,0,"Love it! Great having all my music selections all in one convenient ""spot"". One drawback is not being able to have unlimited access to download my music."
794,Spotify,Bob Mielsch,3,0,"love app. was 5 stars till last update. library screen auto rotates, but play screen doesn't rotate anymore. please fix and i will update back to 5 stars."
795,Spotify,Marcel Grossert,4,0,"Great, reliable app and service behind, I use it as well with my Sonos. The UI is still a bit confusing ;-)"
796,Spotify,Hells Bells,5,6,"Absolutely love this app, I created a14 hour wedding playlist on this!!!!, all sorts of songs and genre's of music to suit everyone. I love the freedom it gives you to listen to every different type of music you like then it gives you suggestions to other playlist you could be interested in. Once you have made your play lists they're there for as long as you want them and you have around a billion songs and artists to choose from. The absolute best app out there bar none!"
797,Spotify,Victor Andersen,5,0,"I mean, it's Spotify. Great music selection and UX. Although the app is near useless without premium, so you should definitely look into that. (Pro-Tip, get another free premium trial by continuously skipping songs)"
798,Spotify,Taine Newland,3,0,"I love spotify, I can honestly say I use it throughout 90% of my day over the past 5 years. I recently upgraded to the Galaxy s10 but for some reason songs will randomly stop playing and then you have to physically go into the app before it automatically starts playing again. Hopefully this gets fixed in the future update"
799,Spotify,Ashley Ryles,5,0,"I have been using spotify since it became available in Canada and have been a loyal loving customer ever since..never did I imagine for Spotify to have a such a positive influence on my everyday life, but they truly have. Also just received a FREE google home mini for being a premium member! wow :) love you spotify! <3"
800,Spotify,_SunsetCatGirl_,2,0,"I love using Spotify but with the latest update, it's been so confusing and annoying. I hate how I can only shuffle play not choose what song to play."
801,Spotify,David MacDonald,1,0,"newest update is terrible. not able to view all my saves artists music, tapping on each artist just goes to their spotify page."
802,Spotify,Francisco TrejoCarranza,2,10,"Ads and more ads, when first playing a song after opening the app, it'll first play an ad with the option to skip or listen to it and listen to music ad free for 30 minutes, but after two or three songs, you'll get 3-4 ads back to back, 20-30 seconds each, same as if you skip. I understand the ads make them money, I have no problem with that, but it gets pretty ridiculous..."
803,Spotify,Magdalene Ng,5,0,"Good songs mix and there are genres that I like! Keep up the good work Spotify! Just started listening to your app, will revert back if there are further comments to improve."
804,Spotify,Infernis Talinis,3,0,I love the app and the music is great but I hate it when it adds songs that you don't want into your playlists. If this part was removed I would rate full 5 stars.
805,Spotify,Liam K,1,0,watch this advert and get 30mins of uninterrupted listening. one song later two more adverts. useless. rather use YouTube
806,Spotify,Ambrus TÃ¶rÃ¶k,5,34,"my only problem is that if you're connected to the internet, the app is fairly slow. all other aspects it is the best"
807,Spotify,Andrew He,2,1,"this app is not working with the lockscreen controls on galaxy s10, other music apps work with the lockscreen controls, any ideas. the controls show up but the buttons aren't working"
808,Spotify,Lidia Rosas,5,0,"Pretty easy to find any song, downloading in high quality has never been so easy, also it's legal. The price is fair, I enjoy my music and so does my family for a considerable amount of money"
809,Spotify,Daniel O'Donoghue,2,0,"Love the service, but your updated ux for 'artists' makes it way harder to listen to what I want to. Please revert/update it to make it easier to sort by recently added, recently played etc. Thank you! :)"
810,Spotify,Ben Kalberer,2,1,Using Spotify in comparison to keeping a personal music collection is the best thing I've ever done with my music! UPDATE: We really need a new shuffle algorithm.
811,Spotify,Cassie M.,2,1,"Great music app. only problem is that recently, the music stops playing. constantly. i go off the app and a few seconds later, it stops. please fix the issue."
812,Spotify,VNIX,1,0,After canceling the subscription of spotify premium I lost the premium privilege while Spotify is still charging me the monthly fee. Outstanding move.jpg
813,Spotify,Pete Finnigan,4,0,"i put subscription service music off for so long because i thought it was cheating the artist. but once you give into the apathy of an insatiable music consumer hell bent on only listening to ""The Hits"", this app becomes the gift that keeps on giving... to yourself."
814,Spotify,Zanyia E. Waters,5,0,This app has been the best thing that has happened to me since I have been diagnosed with depression. Thank you so much spotify for providing me with amazing tunes.
815,Spotify,Zuzu Lake,5,0,Spodify is the best!! I can listen to any song I want anytime with premium. I love the 99 cent deal right now. Perfect during Christmas! Thank you so much for creating a wonderdul music program to listen to all my favorite tunes!! ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶
816,Spotify,Kc Cassidy,3,0,"i want to easily disable the needless gifs or videos, it feels like shuffle isn't that that randomized and plays songs that have played before and feeds on itself and plays primarily those songs. i wish there was an option to play through all the songs in a playlist even when you go back to it. for example, i use Spotify at work and just play it in the background and on break i may want to listen to specific songs, so when i go back to my other playlist i was playing id like to stay where i left"
817,Spotify,Todor Katsarski,3,0,I really dislike that you removed the horizontal song while playing view. I was able to put my phone horizontally and you just removed that option for me. At least make that view configurable from the options.
818,Spotify,derek tran,2,0,it works fine when you're In the app but when I put my phone on sleep mode it crashes and restarts the phone. please fix this. I've tried multiple things to fix it but it might be the app.
819,Spotify,J,3,0,So after a long time of going back and forth I decide to get premium since my new job requires lots of driving. Ever since the app just randomly stops for no reason. Its basically useless and I am not stopping my car every twenty mins to reboot the app every time it has a hissy fit. I may just cancel my subscription at this point ðŸ˜•
820,Spotify,Somsak Pattapat,1,0,"i use android phone, it had no problem in old version but it has to much problem when i use with car bluetooth in new version. i think not reliable for new version of sportify."
821,Spotify,Vinay Bhopale,5,0,beutifull... but payment method is slight confusing
822,Spotify,Paul Carroll,5,3,"What has been done to this recently? Frequently crashing and freezing on my 
S8. Appalling for something I pay for monthly."
823,Spotify,Hernan Rodriguez,4,1,What happened to the artists section? I don't want to see the complete discography of each one. Only the songs I had saved from each one. Put back the previous version!!! It's disgusting!!!
824,Spotify,Fabricio Caetano,2,0,Good to listen to music without caring about the next one. Crashes and closes way too often. Any sound event makes the music stop.
825,Spotify,Dhana kumar,4,1,"Update: After the April 2019 update, I can't pause/play nxt or previous songs in lock screen. This is for Android pie OS. For older version. After toggling btwn few apps found the best."
826,Spotify,curtis crawford,2,2,the app randomly pauses music when screen is off also controls stay in notification panel after I close the app when done listening with no way to remove unless I reset my phone galaxy s10+
827,Spotify,Alexander Hoffmann,3,0,The service itself is fine but the app (Android) become very slow. It might be related to my 600+ songs play list but still. Performance improvement would be highly appreciated.
828,Spotify,Sam Davies,4,0,I love it. the ads get on my nerves sometimes. download spotify and listen to all ur fav artists
829,Spotify,Nasri Nasir,4,0,"close to perfect except for when i had some issues with the profile username because after deactivating fb, my name didnt stay. tried linking back to a new fb acc but error."
830,Spotify,A Google user,2,0,"Was great until they starting hiding the ""made for you"" playlists. Annoying."
831,Spotify,Adrian S,3,0,"The BEST Music service. The app itself is buggy. It was working great for months, but recently the app doesn't load everytime and when it finally does it's very slow and laggy."
832,Spotify,Soumodeep Sarkar,4,0,"Such an amazing streaming app, missed this for long. Just make more songs available for India. Edit - Purchased the premium version and have no complaints except for the number of songs unavailable for India."
833,Spotify,Viviana Herrera,5,1,I love that you can turn off your phone or play games while listening and its better than the youtube music because if you take off youtube or turn it off it wont play this is the best app ever
834,Spotify,vit hei,1,0,Newest ubdate is just terrible. I dont want to see the whole band in artists if I listened to 1 of their songs once
835,Spotify,clarence khoo,1,1,Is Spotify having problems? i can't even login now when im paying it monthly.
836,Spotify,Jesus Espino,1,1,volume keeps failing and lowering on its own checked the app settinga and everything normal glitches... and just not functioning properly
837,Spotify,SHARON SANDERS,5,0,I'M JUST GETTING STARTED ARRANGING ALL OF MY FAVORITE SONGS! I'M NOT QUITE DONE AQUIRING ALL OF MY MUSIC THAT I LOVE YET! I LOVE SPOTIFY!!!
838,Spotify,Lucas Nino,3,0,"I personally have used Spotify for a long time. The app doesn't seem to have any apparent issues to me, the only thing is music controls on Android Pie. For whatever reason the music controls on the lock screen show up and show the correct song and stuff, but trying to skip/pause a song just doesn't work. The buttons don't do anything. Please fix this bug."
839,Spotify,DEATH31415,5,1,I don't know how many times I would have gone insane without internet but I always knew Spotify have a song for me to rock out to
840,Spotify,gig obsessed,2,1,"the new layout absolutely sucks. I can't access the shuffle all song feature anymore and if I only want a few songs from an album, they no longer appear with that artists other songs. put it back!!!"
841,Spotify,Keith Hilliard,2,0,I have changed this review several times because at one point it seems that the Spotify team had a dress the problem I was having. but now it's back. when I shuffle my playlist the app gets stuck on the same three artists... last time I checked that's not shuffle... PLEASE FIX SHUFFLE!
842,Spotify,Bang Obot,5,0,"hey, what if we put an alarm to wake us up in the morning. it'll be great... I think -My random thoughts at 3 am"
843,Spotify,Dori Brooks,5,0,BEST MUSIC APP! Haven't searched for an artist or song and not found it yet! Recommendations for different artists and songs based of what I frequently listen to are great. Discovering new music everday!!!
844,Spotify,Viraj Talwalkar,4,0,"been using it for 3 days.. good playlist, good collection of artists, overall potentially my favorite app.. dont know whether or not it has a 'recently played' list.."
845,Spotify,Mark Costa,5,2,"agreed with what others have said. Been with Spotify for 7 years or so, easily my favourite subscription service, love the PlayStation integration. If i wasn't on this I'd probably be on Napster still."
846,Spotify,pat leblanc,1,0,"Can't log in, reset password doesn't work... Useless"
847,Spotify,Brandon Shives,5,0,"Bloody wonderful (Gordon Ramsey voice) I do say this app is a concert in your pocket. the way you can find any song by your favorite artist, and the simplicity of the entirely of the app just makes music lovers dreams come true."
848,Spotify,Lucy Jabaley,2,3,"I will say, the app has gotten better about shuffling my playlists since the update. But now, I feel there is way more ads than before. I really do appreciate the free version but before the update there was less ads and I wish I was still that way. we had a longer period of listening to music and now the ads come on very often. Please fix."
849,Spotify,Brijesh Patel,5,368,"Best music app. Period. Best music quality and sound, but a downside is that there are only 6 skips for music for the free account. I wish that there are 10 just to make it a ""clean"" number. Also, it would be nice to be able to listen to a bit longer of the song/music in the sample part."
850,Spotify,Alex Tarbox,4,10,"The app is just awesome. massive library of songs, even videos sometimes. everything I've ever heard on the radio I've found on here. even new and small bands or artists. super simple and well worth being a premium member too. my only reason for -1 star is the app now supports ""car mode"" bluetooth however you cant tell the app which bluetooth exactly is your car. I have an aftermarket bluetooth adapter in my car cause the stereo doesn't have it and I cant use car mode while driving."
851,Spotify,Evan Jaynes,3,0,"Lately if I pause a podcast it'll restart the podcast from the beginning, causing me to lose my place. Not a devastating glitch but frustrating as hell."
852,Spotify,Jen r,2,1,can't change music from lock screen worked fine before now it's just very annoying please fix or I'll just change to something else
853,Spotify,Aaryan Jadhav,5,0,"Real Nice App. I got hooked on to this, when I was in Australia for a Work Project. On returning to India, I had no clue what to do as the App was not yet available in India. So, a Big Thanks to the Spotify Team!!!"
854,Spotify,BradTheBeast75,1,121,Spotify is the worst app to listen to music. Now keeps crashing and freezing constantly. if it's not fixed soon I'm cancelling premium cause this is ridiculous. Do not buy premium. It's a waste of money
855,Spotify,A Google user,1,1,app reloading when you unlock your phone since last two updates and still no wav or flac even cd quality would be nice its not the nineties anymore no need for mp3 quality our data speeds can handle 4k video but we are still listening to music in mp3 quality . waste of money i could buy 12 cds a year with at least sound quality is really poor please fix it i got a s9 so it not my phone its just spotify that sounds low and empty compared to everything else
856,Spotify,nNamae S,4,0,"Good app. Some original versions of songs are not available though, mostly revival. And sometimes, search button takes a long time to load"
857,Spotify,alya,5,0,having a great experience using spotify premium its one of the most best if not thw best app to discover new music! its definitely worth the money and even the normal account is worth having because the playlists are just amazing
858,Spotify,Felicia Jacobs,1,0,"since the update yes yesterday, iv had nothing but problems. I can't skip my tracks or select tracks from radio, tracks freeze then skip to others from ages ago....really frustrating especially when I pay for this. not happy"

860,Spotify,Earl Hendrickson,5,0,i love this app. not only can i easily find the music i am lookig for it finds relative music i havent heard and becuase of that i have discovered a whole new world of artists. Thanks Spotify.
861,Spotify,Khushaal Chaudhary,5,0,there is no repeat button and you can't queue up songs. I hope they survive but I'm afraid it looks unlikely against Apple music and other big players.
862,Spotify,Jaymes Plomondon,1,0,terrible music quality. thus may be because its a free version? because i cant know if the paid version sounds as horrific id never risk it. shame because it has such potential.
863,Spotify,joel millar,3,0,good other than three fact that every update screws something up. since the last one I haven't been able to use any controls to cycle through music other than opening the app itself
864,Spotify,Vernon,1,0,"Buffers all the time and i have great wifi/service, I am considering canceling. so frustrating."
865,Spotify,Joer'ct Drew,1,0,"Songs are still in shuffle. I find myself skipping more and more songs on the phone app than I do on my PS4. And what's worse? ""We noticed your skipping through the playlist, try editing it to include more music you like."" Editing the playlist will RUIN it, and even then I want one specific song in the list. Either make the mobile app like using the computer and console versions or give me control of my playlists at the least! Edit: dont worry about it, I'm uninstalling and using strictly desktop"

869,Spotify,David B,5,8,"I truly love this app. Amazing music choices, even my favorite underground artists. The radio suggestions are spot on, great algorithms, clearly. Spotify works anywhere in the world and allows you to seemlessly switch from device to device without missing a beat. Spotify premium is totally worth it, especially since it now includes hulu. I'd love to work for a company with such great business practices. Cheers from the U.S and Dominican Republic! Keep up the good work!"

874,Spotify,Herculano Fernandes,4,0,it is a wonderful app it lets you listen to your favourite songs but when it comes to the launching time it takes hell lot of time you have to actually wait fir about 30 seconds for it to launch so spotify if your reading this comment i hope you could plz reply back to me cause it is an issue qith my phone or weather with the app i am not really sure so i hope that you will reply to my this comment and as soon as possible solve my issues with the launching of the app yeah thats all other wiseðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ

876,Spotify,A Google user,3,1,"This layout isn't doing it for me. I actually hate it. But no one's gonna read this and everything else is great, so... Yeah."
877,Spotify,Jaff Cubed,4,0,A lot of the issue have been fixed but as a free user I find the phone app it's more limited you can't play just any song off the bad it limits it to 6 skips an hour it's better on a tablet tbh it doesn't limit you to 6 skips on a tablet as someone that doesn't get a lot of monthly income and can't currently pay for premium I'll like at least unlimited skips and to be able to play any song not just the tiny example or having to shuffle play it I don't mind the ads to be honestly
878,Spotify,Orbital gaming,4,0,its exceptionally good the only problem is that it keeps crashing when i reopen to chnge the song...... still it doesn't happen often... overall it's a great app

880,Spotify,Gabriela Tonelli,5,0,"There are many music apps and this app really did a lot of things that made it better than others. Such as you can make your own albums, chose your own favorite artists, and many more. This is a great app to have."
881,Spotify,Jose Francisco,5,0,its spotify my dude. not much to say but its amazing. the service is top notch and the android app works without issue.

883,Spotify,Kinetic Kiwi,1,0,"Logs me out as soon as i login in this newest update, making the app literally useless. Thank god i haven't purchased premium."
884,Spotify,Dargol ofRivermouth,5,0,"Excellent music streaming application: great sound quality (though lacks MQA - at least for now), great playlists that are created for you specifically. Managing your own playlists is easy and it is easy to discover new music."
885,Spotify,Alessandro Ridi,2,0,"Frustrante. Da un po di tempo a questa parte Ã¨ diventato impossibile riuscire ad ascoltare musica come si deve perche l'app non carica nessuna playlist, nessun album, ecc. Poi non parliamo della sezione di ricerca. Non riesco mai a cercare una canzone, nonostante la connessione dati funzioni perfettamente"
886,Spotify,Gennario Veltaine,2,0,"I love the app, premium member. but the menu is on a terrible spot for southpaws"
887,Spotify,Eric Finney,2,0,"Ever since the last update the app hasn't worked well with my trucks Blutooth, if thr scrren on my phone is turned off it wont change songs anymore, I used to be able to get in my truck and have the app auto connect and work fine, now it connects plays half a song then the app closes and I have to open my phone and restart the app."
888,Spotify,Samantha Breitlauch,1,1,"Does Spotify intend to fix this app any time soon? Why did they have to go fixing something that was not broken? This app used to be the best out there. My next day off, I intend to write down my list of songs and take it somewhere else that appreciates my business if they can't get this fixed."
889,Spotify,Shawn Stewart,5,23,"Still stays in portrait mode on play view. Will not landscape. This is not good, especially for driving."
890,Spotify,Jessica Vasquez,1,0,"Thinking about uninstalling because of all the cutoffs ever since the update. I'm paying money for music I cant listen to at all because of the cutting in and out and sometimes not even coming back on. Plus when I bluetooth it to my car, there have been times when I couldn't use my buttons to switch to the next song. At first it was a great app for years that I have used but now I'm thinking about switching because of the update."
891,Spotify,Soumavo_ DeS,3,0,"One of the best music streaming apps out there , no doubt but well I have no idea why some artists (Linkin park, Led Zeppelin) and most of Ed Sheeran's songs are not available in India (god why are there region based content restrictions at all ..)"
892,Spotify,Rahdi Adalaja,5,0,I love this app!!! I can listen to any & everything on this Wonderful app. I love Classic Music....I think I am stuck in a time warp.lol THANK YOU SPOTIFY FOR BEING BY MY SIDE WE I NEED SUCH COMFORT TO EASE MY MIND BODY & SPIRIT!!!
893,Spotify,Sjoenes Wieringa,2,0,"I have had this app for quite a while now and it works really great, however with a recent update I lost the ability to save my downloaded songs to my sd card and I have no idea why. It sucks because I have almost no space on my internal storage and a lot on the sd card. I hope this option will be added back again."
894,Spotify,Ayeesha Curmoula,5,0,"I use Spotify on a daily basis. I love the fact that Spotify creates various playlists, and songs based on your taste and introduces new artists to you. Most if m playlist now consists of songs that were recommended to me from Spotify. Whilst I do have the paid version, I really don't mind paying for the premium services, and they tailor and seek out new songs/playlists for you."
895,Spotify,BEAST MODE,5,0,great i love the fact that all the music i listen to is hear the only problem i have is that before i was able to have my songs organized by artist in my playlist but in one of your previous updates you guys removed that feature. i would like it if that were to comeback
896,Spotify,Mart 44,5,0,"franchement exelent l'interface est bien meilleures que les concurrents ( je les aie testÃ© ) En hors connexion, on retrouve plusieurs fois le mÃªme titre, dommage. Quand on a tÃ©lÃ©chargÃ© un album, l'affichage de tous les titres serait pas mal. aprÃ¨s je suis sur Android, et je sais que les ios ont des maj plus rapidement."
897,Spotify,Ups Upsla,2,1,Suddenly i see spotify being uninstaled (dissapear) & i loose the music. i feel paying for nothingðŸ‘Ž
898,Spotify,Isaac 08,1,0,so THIS IS VERY CONFUSING I DONT KNOW HOW IT WORKS. EVERYTIME I GO ON THE SONG I WANT IT JUST PLAYS ANOTHER SONG AND ENDS UP AS A PLAYLIST CAN YOU MAKE IT EASIER TO FIND THE SONG YOU WANT TO PLAY WITHOUT IT ACTIVATING A FREAKING PLAYLIST?!!?!?!?!
899,Spotify,Jamie Mitchell,2,717,this latest update the music literally stops after every. single. song and I have to unlock my phone before it will start the next one. what a joke. plus I find it really lazy that these devs never bother to tell you exactly what has changed from one update to the next but they update it like weekly. the last two updates have been buggy as hell but this one takes the cake. going back to amazon prime music til they fix it.
900,Spotify,Sophia Claire M. Castro,4,0,PLEASE BRING BACK THE OPTION TO CREATE A RADIO STATION i love this app soo much but recently they've removed the option to create a radio station which is my favorite feature on this app. It allows me to find new music and artists so pleaseeee spotify bring it back!!
901,Spotify,HAC TUBE,3,0,"I had been waiting for spotify to come in india since soo long.But when it finally came and i was all set to shift to spotify premium me and all of my other friends noticed that major artists like ed sheeran,linkin park,coldplay,green day etc were missing(at least most of their songs were) now i just wanna know when will you fix this.......because when you do we will all shift to spotify"
902,Spotify,Oz apmktg,5,0,I use this app multiple times a day every day. been a proud subscriber ever since I signed up 3 years ago. love everything about it.
903,Spotify,Troy Davies,5,0,Please make a visualiser for the TV app. I feel like i will get screen burn soon. I would love to be a consultant on what visuals you produce.
904,Spotify,Tony Ignacio,1,0,"barely functions on android (S9 plus running Pie). randomly will stop playing after a song finishes, you have to open up the app to get it to start going again. widgets, drop down shortcut dont function. lock screen skip, back and play generally never work, you have to open up the app to do anything. only up side is it's not missing as many artists or albums like Google play or apple music. been going on even before the update"
905,Spotify,Lisa Wahler,1,0,Not sure what's going on but this app gets more buggy with each update! I can't use car controls & songs just stop playing then the app freezes. I'm getting very close to getting rid of Spotify. I pay too much for all these ongoing issues!!!
906,Spotify,Matticas,1,0,"Notifications every few minutes saying connecting. Damn annoying. Fails to cast regularly, POS. DI casts fine every time."
907,Spotify,Cali Watkins,5,1,"probably one of the only apps ive rated. ive been trying ti expand my musical tastes, and was trying to find new electronic artists. i thoroughly enjoyed going through the playlists and having songs seamlessly transition into one another to the point where i almost couldnt tell when a new song began, rather sounding like a new chorus. I loved it."
908,Spotify,Nick Morrison,4,0,App has been great. Music stops sometimes for some reason while streaming and the song restarts. Hopefully this is fixed soon.
909,Spotify,KT Duck Squad,5,0,"This app is amazing. It is one of the best ways of listening to music as you can make playlists and listen to all of your favourites. I think that to make this app even better, on collaborative playlists you should only be able to give certain users access to changing the playlist as that would make like a lot easier for all of Spotify's users. Both the premium and free access is amazing."
910,Spotify,Bri Noneofyourbusiness,2,536,Screen controls on the lock screen do not work. Have to unlock or use Bluetooth. Galaxy S10.
911,Spotify,Bembi Bi,3,0,"Ich mag die App wirklich. Kostenlos Musik hÃ¶ren und Playlists erstellen,... wirklich super! Es nervt aber, dass immer wieder diese Werbung zwischendurch kommt! Ich mÃ¶chte die Lieder hÃ¶ren, die ich in meine Playlist rein gemacht habe und keine Empfohlenen! Ich erstelle ja nicht umsonst eine Playlist mit Liedern die ich mag! Ich verstehe auch das nicht alles umsonst sein kann (ist vollkommen verstÃ¤ndlich). Ich hoffe wirklich das man da etwas machen kann. Danke, fÃ¼r das durchlesen."
912,Spotify,Pritesh Vaghela,4,0,Best app and personally my first choice for songs but the non premium users might face frustrating things such as limited number of skips or not being able to play full songs but only a few seconds and ton of ads on UI and between songs.
913,Spotify,Lia Henny,5,0,we subscribe for the premium and it can be used up to 5 accounts! so amazing....we always love this appðŸ¤—
914,Spotify,Luke S,4,0,good music quality. excellent variety. app a bit clumsy to use and some settings could do with a rethink.
915,Spotify,derek oconnell,5,0,"this app is great because all the singers you download are free. You may bring it anywhere and dosen't need any connection.If you go into search you can find songs of movies, T.V. programs,orjust singers and if you dont know the name of the song or singer type up thechorous or lyrics.If you decide to get the FREE app I hope you enjoy it !!!!"
916,Spotify,Logan Siar,3,0,i have loved spotify for years but this latest update broke the apps best deature and that was the ability to see every artist i saved and downloaded and all their songs in a singke easy to access menu now that entire feature is missing and i have to rediscover artists i cant even see the downloaded songs i have saved.
917,Spotify,A Google user,2,1,"Sooooo glitchy lately. Spins and spins. Stop, restart, Force Stop, Clear cache, restart...ugh. Fix this please."
918,Spotify,Martin Wood-Holland,4,0,Great app and easy to use but I can't work out why some songs are taken off and unplayable. Until this issue is solved it gets 5 stars
919,Spotify,Ferenc Srajner,1,1,it's unusable now. deletes all my songs whenever I disconnect from a wifi. lost a lot of mobile data because of it
920,Spotify,Derek Kirby,5,0,"Best music app ever. I can't even tell you the last time I used Pandora. It doesn't kill my battery like other music apps and I'm able to download my favorite albums so if I'm somewhere where I don't get service, I can still listen to my favorite music. Thanks Spotify"
921,Spotify,Worngayung Kasar,5,0,simply amazing. too bad its not available in India
922,Spotify,Enes SUBAÅžI,3,0,"I used to love the place of queue button but you need to touch twice to get there. It was a lot easier to arrange the order of songs that will come along. I would love the app even more if this gets back. Furthermore, even though genius facts are great, you should add lyrics to MUCH more songs, for certain."
923,Spotify,Jol. Blue,5,0,"Undoubtedly the best variety; nonetheless, the free version considers advancing to another song as a luxury. You can only advance to the next (or shuffle) a few times, then if you exceed the maximum amount of ""skips"" you'll get a message that says ""you just discovered a premium feature!"" LOL! Awesome app nonetheless."
924,Spotify,prajwal singh,1,1,"There some big HIT songs (like : going bad(feat. Drake), Money-Cardi B, simulation theory by Muse(whole album), etc.) which are unavailable for indian users. Please remove such restrictions!!!"
925,Spotify,Sharan Kumar.P.K,3,15,"Free user here. I didn't mind the ads and liked the music catalogue and most of the features. A few minor issuess I noticed - 1. No Shuffle or Repeat which means I have to click Play when the playlist stops, which is annoying if you're driving. 2. A small bug which i see after using the app for some time. The home gets obscured by an ad that switches to the player when closed, effectively locking out the home. Closing the app and opening it again fixes it, but it's still an annoyance."
926,Spotify,A,1,0,"Spotify has the absolute best music service, that is undermined by a very bad user interface. Numerous glitches with saving songs and ridiculous implementations of basic features, most notably putting all the actions for a song in a triple dot icon that is impossible to hit precisely, make it a true shame that Spotify could be the end all be all of music with its sophisticated suggestion algorithms and full access without a premium account, if only its developers weren't so lazy and/or illogical"
927,Spotify,Yiannis Gavras,3,0,"Need to give more options in general especially from casting over WI fi on music quality quality. Try to improve algorithm on music suggestions, it shows same songs over and over. Also try to make interface more user-friendly. In general Spotify rules....! Oh and provide lyrics and song artist info especially with the paid subscription!"
928,Spotify,Ali J,2,0,"I have never had an issue with Spotify, i use it in my car via blue tooth all the time but over the last 3 months the song title displayed in my car freezes and doesn't change. the song change but the info displayed doesnt. Please fix this glitch, it is very annoying"
929,Spotify,Dwayne Perry,1,1,keeps pausing for no reason. tried all my options to fix it and it does the same thing.
930,Spotify,Kenshi Masaki,4,0,"it's a very good app when you're subscribed to it. There's no ads and has unlimiyed skips and can play any specific song from a playlist by clicking it, which is not available to the free version. I only gave it 4 stars because some songs that i have found online aren't in the roster of spotify."
931,Spotify,Khotso Timothy,5,0,"I've come to the conclusion that's spotify is the best app ever, really every song I can think of is available, and the best playlists made for me that's just!!! totally worth the R59,99 thank you"
932,Spotify,Gal Zeidman,5,0,"what can i say. subscribed the day they started operating in israel, and i love it. only complaint i can think about is, what took you so long???"
933,Spotify,Chara Elizabeth Smith,5,0,"This app is my everythingðŸ¤©. Well worth it. I love premium!! With premium I also have a free hulu subscription. Thousands of artists singles and albums at my finger tips as often as I want to listen to them is a miracle. Their radio, and personalized songs list are wonderful too. I also like seeing what songs mean. Premium also allows you to play songs in the background. #fanforever #lovespotify #don'tstopbeinggood #betterthanyoutubeforpuremusiclistening"
934,Spotify,Emily Culter,4,0,"it is so amazing to be able to listen to my favorite songs, but if you dont have premium then you only have 6 skips an hour and there can sometimes be adds almost every other or 3 other songs and 4 before your next song.ðŸ™‚ðŸ˜ðŸ™ðŸ˜ â˜º"
935,Spotify,FRESHY No1,4,0,"when listening to music through the xbox one app I tend to use my phone to skip songs but most of the time it says something completely different to what I am listening to, hence the 4 star, apart from that wee bug its a good app."
936,Spotify,xIntelligent Owl,4,0,"Spotify is a really good app. It has a wide range of songs and Spotify Premium has a really reasonable price. I rated it 4 stars because when you make your own playlist, music is added that you maybe do not want. Could you please add an option to take away this feature?"
937,Spotify,Nele Francke,1,0,I really love it but as long my phone can't see my laptop being online while my laptop is able to see my phone being online and I have to get up and get to my computer to change songs/volume/playlist I rate it 1 star. why has this function always been there but hasn't it ever worked?
938,Spotify,Christine B.,5,21,"Should be able to see both the queue and history, just like it is on desktop. Also, please make the widget resizeable."

I searched for my first choice of song ""chandan sa badan"" by Mukesh. it is very beautiful song. but I couldn't find it because its not there. many other retro songs I tried. but no Original artist is added there. How the app got 500M+ users. Sorry Spotify."
945,Spotify,Tamra Kemp,1,0,"This app was great until it started playing a song then stopped right after and didn't continue playing. You have to go into the app and get it to go to the next song manually. doing it once, fine. Having restart the music after every song sucks."
946,Spotify,kyle salisbury,4,0,I would rate it 5 stars but the only annoying thing is that by brother can some how get in my Spotify when he has sent even installed it and I haven't even gave him my password or ID it annoying.
947,Spotify,Gayla McCormick,5,0,"Love this music app, tried another popular one & after a week it started cutting in & out, seemed like they did it on purpose so you'd buy the upgrade, got sick of it & tried Spotify, don't have any problems with it & love their recommendations for more songs in your genre, keep up the great work Spotify"
948,Spotify,A Google user,3,0,"lately, 10 or 15 seconds into the song it just stops and doesn't play again, I thought it was my phone and restarted but it kept doing it and I also uninstalled and reinstalled it and the situation is happening again, please spotify fix this"
949,Spotify,Eimantas Adzgauskas,4,0,"Good app, would like the algorithms to recognise the songs I don't like as much based on the way I always skip them etc and not recommended them or include them in auto generated playlists, would also be great to have a selection for recommendations of similar sounding music not similar tastes to other people"
950,Spotify,Mary M,5,0,Great Music App I love that I can do so many playlists and add so many songs. it's never given me a problem I've had it for a couple years now and still my favorite music app and I have 3 of them. I use it every day! It's very easy to navigate.

955,Spotify,Zane Jury,5,0,"If you're trying out Spotify for the first time be prepared for an incredible experience when you buy Spotify Premium, $9.99 a month to search and play any song that you want, make playlist and discover new music.

956,Spotify,Scotty C,1,2,constantly has been going in and out while streaming have never had this problem before definitely isn't my phone which is a note 9. fix it
957,Spotify,Eric Adelhoch,4,0,"Just about any song you can think of is on here, it has to be really obscure, or really new to not be, and even then , chances are, you'll find it. in the last year or so the app...only sometimes... does not allow sd card saves which makes storage on my phone impossible. also randomly my downloads will reset which is immensely frustrating. it's still the best music app I know of, but it has issues, that make it annoying."
958,Spotify,Julio CÃ©sar Carbajal,3,1,No puedo ver el control de volumen dentro de la app sino hasta que ingreso a alguna opciÃ³n para conectar a un dispositivo y salgo de dicha opciÃ³n.

959,Spotify,Brooke Pearson,4,0,good but when you don't have premium the ads are very intrusive. maybe tone it down a tad bit ay?
960,Spotify,Khairuzzaman Yazzid,5,0,App is all good and works well with my TV when its connected via WIFI. Been subscribed for quite a long time and will continue to do so as I'm searching for new songs to hear everyday

964,Spotify,Tommie Johansson,1,0,Stupid notification on my phone that is impossible to get rid of if you do not quit Spotify everywhere you are logged in. Is there no other way than deleting this freak from my phone?
965,Spotify,gilbert vasquez,5,0,"I love it, and the students discount makes it very affordable not to mention the free Hulu account that comes with it.

966,Spotify,Jubilee Chambers,1,0,So i am a premium member and i have most of my music downloaded because i dont have a lot of data and its been wonderful but since the last update my downloaded songs wont play and when they do they stop frequently making my music impossible to use will fix rating if the problem is fixed.
967,Spotify,Venice Doble,5,0,I love this app. I have tried other music apps but they don't have most of the Latin tropical I'm into. I highly recommend this. should have a section for the lyrics.
968,Spotify,PC- 31,4,0,all good but i wish youd put what the bloody update is in the update description. annoying
969,Spotify,Benjamin Avetoom,1,0,this is terrible I made a play list and then turned as we added to your play list a load of garbage I nether added I don't appreciate this. so I added crab rave baby shark then said below them we added a load of music that is inappropriate that I nether added if I could rate I would give it a 0 stars
970,Spotify,Doggo Doggo,2,0,I got an ad appear on my screen and for some reason when I say dismiss it goes back to what I was listening then when I want to check out other artists the ad is still there and when I dismiss it again it goes back over and over again it's annoying

985,Spotify,Hoang Tran,4,0,great app with great features- few things id improve on are the lyrics - should have an option between behind the lyrics and just having the normal lyrics on! plus video feature like apple music and tidal! other wise a great app!

990,Spotify,Arthur DeLaGarza,5,0,Love it!!! Tried other apps but didnt like the price or didnt have a wide verity selection of music lie spotify does. Price is affordable for unlimited music for a couple of devices which I cant compain for other apps charge more after 2 device logins.=(
991,Spotify,Yessenia Smullen,1,0,"Giving the app 1 star until they fix the new UI they're testing for new users. I pay for Premium and it is stupid how the new interface is set up. Saving songs is a nightmare; whoever came up with the stupid idea to sort liked songs into a single playlist instead of the old way where you could search by song, artist, album should NOT have been given the green light to implement it. The new interface is extremely frustrating and difficult. DON'T fix an interface that isn't broken!"
992,Spotify,Dan Plante,2,0,I didn't like that they tried to pick music like what you listen too and it's not even close for the money Spotify is making they could do better for their customers I cancelled my subscription and went with Amazon prime for 2$ and you get a wayyy better bang for your buck

994,Spotify,Dulce M. Rivera,2,0,"The free version of this app is so bad, you can only listen to music on shuffle and even if you create a playlist with your favorite songs it will add random songs to it, also you can only skip songs a few times per hour and it's loaded with advertisements."
995,Spotify,David Bybee,4,0,"Overall I'm pretty satisfied, however I wish the mobile version could access my local files saved on my phone...

Add the local music capabilities for mobile, and an easy five stars."
996,Spotify,Alpesh Jadeja,1,0,"First thing is dont force people to try stuff. ads i can understand.

997,Spotify,Monique Poe,5,0,spotify works very well. It plays when my phone is locked. I have premium and I wish it still had the setting where I can press the dislike so that it wont come across my feed unless it was in the playlist but it wouldn't play.
998,Spotify,Esteban Billordo,1,0,"After the last update, the artist menu no longer shows all my downloaded music. The only way to access it is in albums. Rating the app accordingly until this is changed and cancelling my subcription at the end of the month if it is not."
999,Spotify,steve white,5,0,I have constant issues trying to open spotify after upgrading my phone. App doesnt open most of the time now. If i restart my phone it might work for a few times but always stops opening. I like spotify but this makes me want to deactivate my premium account. Why keep paying for something that only works sometimes?
1000,Spotify,F.B.I,1,0,"Spotify is turning into YouTube, YouTube is so strict with copyright and even if use your own song you get copyrighted. On spotify you literally need premium to hear the whole song instead of a preview it sucks This new update sucks I miss the old spotify"
1001,Spotify,Blood,2,0,It sucks you cant pick the music u want ot just says shuffle play so it picks a random song but its better on xbox phone spotify sucks ass

1003,Spotify,Jared Lim,3,0,i really like spotify but i tried to go premium and i did everything but the pin code never showed up for me to get premium so if it could work i would give it a better rating but for now it'll stay as a three star
1004,Spotify,David MacDonald,1,0,Almost unusable on the mobile app unless you have premium. Inordinately difficult at times to play the song you want without being sent onto a similarly themed playlist featuring totally different artists.

1011,Spotify,Holly Nagle,5,0,"have used spotify for a few years now and love everything about it. takes note of music as I listen and makes playlists for me based on my listening, recommends artists and playlists, stores all the music I save efficiently and is easy to use. well worth the subscription fee"
1012,Spotify,Kreamu Kawaii,1,0,I have to listen on shuffle. I hate it because on other devices this doesn't happen. It says I require premium but other devices dont need it. This app is a waste of time.
1013,Spotify,Felipe Aguilar,1,0,"horrible experience, every time I try to find a song the screen freezes black, when I try to change the songs the player does not respond and the music does not change and it keeps sounding the same.

1035,Spotify,Jose Gomez,3,0,"my experience was just a worse as pandoras expeirence because theres like three adds talkiing about ""dont add suck"" and when you make a playlist, like they somtimes dont even play the songs on your playlist they just play a random, you let us make a playlist for a reason, so we could listen to the music we want not music you want us to listen to"

1037,Spotify,Mykell Miller,1,0,The last update took away the option to download to the SD card. Then without warning it started downloading to my phone's internal memory until it was full. Fix it or lose me as a customer.

1045,Spotify,Owen Wilson,2,0,It was good but after the latest update the 15 second skip forward/back for podcasts no longer works using Bluetooth controls nor does pausing music from Bluetooth which means I have to turn the radio down/off in the car if I need silence for a minute.

1047,Spotify,Faith Barker,3,0,the ads get on my last nerve but I'm too broke to get premium. I could watch an ad and then another can come on and that really needs to be fixed. We came to listen to music not ads.
1048,Spotify,Angel Gastelum,2,0,I'm a premium member with the family plan. after the last update I can't control the music via lock screen or wearable devices. I can only control music in app. If this is not resolved I will consider canceling my subscription and joining Tidal.

Actually whole time i heard songs with my memories.. and this app really nice theme. premium more and more the best sound clarity being i like that.

1050,Spotify,Sofia Romero,1,0,"When I add new songs to my playlist and they come in the Queque they won't play, or will start playing but suddenly stop, or once the song finishes it won't pass to the next song. it's not my Internet connection that is not working, since I have this songs downloaded. Cause I PAY for them. Fix that please."
1051,Spotify,James Usi,1,0,"Automatic subscriptions sucks. Just cancel off service right off the bat after non payment. Not everyone wants to pay and be charged again on the same month just because ""system auto pay"". Uninstalled your stupid app."
1052,Spotify,Ross Anderson,4,0,"I love that I can cast to my speakers around the house, use it in Google maps and have songs that I Shazam automatically add to a playlist in Spotify. I just don't find the UI very logical or quick to use."
1053,Spotify,Joby Susilo,1,0,"NEW UPDATE IS AWFUL. I cant play or pause or skip songs from my lockscreen anymore and most cover pictures do not load. Fix this, Spotify. Why do we pay a monthly subscription if you guys can't get the basics to work."

1059,Spotify,Jessie Miller,5,0,I pay for Spotify and this last update shuts off my app randomly...music keeps playing during phone calls despite me exiting out. Music will stop playing after 4.5 songs. I want this fixed.
1060,Spotify,Caroline Walker,5,0,fab if you have premium. I got it as free add on with vodafone contract. if you have the free Spotify your tormented with adds which you can't stop and also you can't have full control of playlist. look out for premium spotify as a bonus as it's worth it.
1061,Spotify,A Google user,4,1,Latest updates have fixed my issues with the app. Spotify is relatively easy to navigate and makes streaming to other devices simple.
1062,Spotify,Steve Chapman,5,0,"Just does the job and has a fantastic UI. Sound quality via my quite revealing proper hifi system is excellent, but lossless streaming would be nice. Fantastic music selection and great recommendations. The era of buying CDs is over."
1063,Spotify,Raluca Sorescu Moreels,2,1,"it is so annoying that every time i try to add some songs to a playlist and i search the artist -> go to his page -> go into the album and try to add a song, everything closes and i have to do the process all over. Really, really stupid."

1066,Spotify,JiÅ™Ã­ SedlÃ¡k,3,0,After the last update it's not possible to change playback volume by tapping the (green) name of the device at the bottom of the Now playing page. Reverted back to the previous version until this (possibly) gets fixed.
1067,Spotify,Karlina Yates,1,0,i'm discontinuing my subscription before i'm charged next month. so many problems. i've had to start from scratch too many times to count because they've cleared all my downloads or locked me out of my account. the shuffle is awful.. it's expensive for so many problems
1068,Spotify,Bracey Thacker,2,0,"I can't even use my account. I guess Spotify let some one take over my account and I have to pay for there account. The bad thing is now every thing they send me even the play list is in Spanish. I'm not, nor am I close to being hispanic. Its ridicules. I guess I lost everything."
1069,Spotify,John Ryan Hisarza,5,0,"You made my day soooo motivated. This music app is limitless, I can choose any songs that suits my taste. And any songs that has explicit content, you understand that when I click report this. I hope you have some new songs coming soon on your way."

1073,Spotify,Timo Edsel,5,0,My internet is fine but the app itself is slow and unresponsive!! Totally disappointed compared to the iOS and PC counterparts
1074,Spotify,DinÃ§er Ä°NCE,3,0,I really don't understand why UI goes worse and worse in every iteration. Only phone sizes are growing not our thumb length. Make things available to be used one handed!
1075,Spotify,Jaymond Galaxy,5,0,"My favorite music platform, but the app doesn't run smoothly on my older devices, also it doesn't always play in the background when I use some apps."
1076,Spotify,A Google user,4,1,well done Spotify you did a great job next time please fix when ever i remove my tab the song stops please make it so i can listen to song while playing video games please so that why i gave it a 4 it pretty good actually well done

I'm a premium customer with a $1500 S10+ I expect to get my money's worth, my phone is the latest on the market so you can't blame the software glitch on a older model phone."
1078,Spotify,Ubad Hamudii,1,1,on ps4 i cant listen to some music because it says spotifty cant play this right now and im in europe
1079,Spotify,Dannette Fee,5,0,"I've tried several music apps & Spotify works best for me! They have a great selection of music/bands, both mainstream & obscure! Love it!"
1080,Spotify,Kathleen Risko,4,0,"Love this app! One option I hope Spotify adds is the ability to organize each of my playlists into alphabetical order. That functioning is available in my Liked songs playlist, but none of the other playlist I have created. please add that functioning!"
1081,Spotify,Archeus -of- Life,5,0,10/10 would recommend. I use spotify every. single. day. It is probably my most favorite music app of all time. The selection of music is so diverse and there hasn't been a single issue I've had since download. Thank you Spotify!
1082,Spotify,Kamaljit Cookie,1,0,You add songs that we didn't even add and What if it swears and a KID is listening g to a song? please stop adding your OWN songs you wanna add 'Cause we don't even know them sometimes please fix it.

1087,Spotify,Mert Ã‡akÄ±n,1,0,"It forces you to buy ""Premium Account"", which has no use except "" no ads"" with those annoying ads. So ads are only there just to force you pay monthly. Because no one is giving ads to this app. You only hear stupid jokes about why you should buy premium..."
1088,Spotify,Soumya Acharya,2,0,The music features get the 2 stars... the missing stars and the reason of hesitation for the premium version is the un dissmisable advertisement banner over the song itself... which doesn't let me select songs anymore.
1089,Spotify,who am I? Im the doctor,3,0,Well of people dont want to be interupted by annoying ads maybe spotify should just not advertise rather than asking for a credit card number just to go for premium.
1090,Spotify,Kitty Seinrich,1,0,"I PAY FOR PREMIUM AND ALL IT DOES IS SKKIIIPP! The songs are impossible to listen to - none of my other music apps skip, not even the free ones. It started two updates ago. FIX THIS"
1091,Spotify,Akshay Shinde,3,0,I loved this app but reason behind the three stars is that there are many songs that are not available to play even if when using spotify premium which tends me to change my mind to buy a apple music premium plan. Hope Spotify will fix this ASAP.
1092,Spotify,Kenneth Waller,5,0,I only give this rating now I finally upgraded to get rid of the ads - most of which are for Spotify and very annoying. But I guess that's the idea! Cheers

1094,Spotify,Citra Iswara,3,0,The app doesn't always appear on the notifications bar (unlike the lite version) even tho it has the priority on. Too bad the lite version doesn't support listening to other devices. I could've use that version.

1097,Spotify,A Google user,2,0,"Second Rate This app is an obvious afterthought when compared to iOS. I'm so tired of seeing major mainstream apps drop the ball on Android development. From the constant, slow screen refreshes when switching tabs, to the equalizer not working properly, causing some to studder, it's clear this app lags behind iOS in support."

1111,Spotify,Rares-Andrei Cristescu,4,0,"Fantastic app but could use some improvements. For example you should be able to press and hold to select a song amd choose to delete, add to playlist, share, etc. in addition, once you press and hold one song, others should also be open to selection so you could add multiple song to a playlist simultaneously"

4561,Pandora,Joshua Shannon,3,56,"I love this app and have been using it for about 5 years. 3 of those years on iOS. one thing that bugs me is that if I keep it paused for too long,it decides to just poop out or sonething. I leave it paused and then it won't play until I open the app again. Even more annoyong, the song I had paused is skipped. Another thing is that if I pause it, lock my phone, then unlock my phone to pandora, it'll just start playing. What's up with that? I had it paused and now out of nowhere it's playing."
4562,Pandora,Jeff Berg,1,344,"Pandora has been a pretty solid app in the past but I absolutely detest their revamped site after the latest update. The previous setup was great, user friendly, and quick to have it do exactly what I want it to do. The same can no longer be said. I don't want sliding tiles and the new look itself is less than appealing. The app used to be great but now I use YouTube mixes for the car, gym, and at home. I'll consider using this more if it would go back to something resembling its older self"
4563,Pandora,Louis Magill,1,60,"Moved to a new device. Transferred apps. Went to Pandora. My Premium account disappeared. Now they want me to upgrade again. Am I going to get charged twice for my old & new Premium subscription? Why can't I have my Premium subscription available on the new device? Btw, they say in the upgrade process that you can cancel any tim through Google Play. Not that I could see. And why can't I just get out of the app instead of force stopping it. There's gotta be something better. Amazon Prime Music?"
4564,Pandora,Drunk Llama,1,9,"A complete overhaul of the UI is needed. There is many bugs and it is very tedious to use. Many times the background turns black while the text turns to a dark grey, making the text almost impossible to read. When making a playlist and pressing ""Add similar songs"", it takes me back to the top of the playlist, making me have to scroll through hundreds of songs just to get to the beginning."
4565,Pandora,Austin McDaniel,4,76,"Pandora is a great music radio app with good algorithms for deciding what you might like. It does become a little repetitive with song choices, but its not terrible. My biggest issue is that the app no longer works properly when trying to launch from my car. after researching it appears this is a common problem and works with some phones and cars, but mine worked just fine before the update that ""fixed"" the issue. It wasn't broken until they tried to improve it. Fix this issue and earn 5 stars."
4566,Pandora,Brittany Rivera,1,77,"Music plays for a few seconds and then cuts off. I have to go back in the app to press play and it jumps to the next song and it plays for a few seconds and cuts off. Fix the issue or I am deleting my account and installing the app. I have been using Pandora for 19 years and never had a problem. I am not able to update or I would to fix the problem. Until it is fixed I will continue to use the ""YTMusic"" app. ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡"
4567,Pandora,Tori Marie,1,11,"I loved pandora. it always picked the best songs. but lately it just stops playing half way through the song. once I unlock my screen it automatically skips the song and goes to another one, where that one then stops playing halfway through. I can't even listen to this app anymore. I've tried everything from updating to trouble shooting and it continues to have issues. I will have to just uninstall. what a shame"
4568,Pandora,Malachi Kistler,3,17,"3 major problems with this app for someone who uses it roughly 7 hours a day. First, not pre-buffering songs is super annoying when listening to albums, it takes away from the feel of the experience. Second, randomly in the middle of a track the song will unexpectedly skip to the next track and then I have to go back to the previous song. And lastly, licensing problems need to be dealt with. I'm not sure how that works but with paying $10 a month I feel there can be extra work done to fix this."
4569,Pandora,Chaos In Rush,3,3,"Bothersome. I recently switched to spotify and occasionally this app will open all by itself while I'm listening to spotify and play music, interrupting me. I have no clue why it does that, as I never open it myself and I won't even have the app on the page im viewing and it will do that. also, the ads are pervasive and annoying and sometimes play two or three in a row between songs."
4570,Pandora,Marah York,5,1380,"i love the variety, no adds, you create different playlists depending on your mood, occasion, party. you get to listen to stuff you love as well as discover new artistes you've never heard before widening your horizon with artists and genres. theres everything from oldies, classics to just hit the radio. best thing is that your children can love it to. They have Disney songs from your favorite Disney movies to kids Bop, lullaby for babies, to sing alongs of your favorite childhood nursery rhymes."
4571,Pandora,Katie Purdy,3,8,"i had to reinstall it to see if the issue i had with custom playlists would fix, as it wprks perfectly fine on my console and used to be fine on my phone. the playlists will not play at all. it will stay as buffering, skipping every single song on the playlist. there is no update nor any reason this should be happening as it was fine before."
4572,Pandora,Ka Comix,4,2,"Pandora is AMAZING!! From top to bottom but whenever I have another app streaming(like me accually playing said game) like Gacha Life it just shuts itself down. Entirely. Right in the middle of a song. It's really hard to enjoy my music when this happens. Ibis Paint X is another victum of the bug, and it's only with certain apps. On Minecraft it's perfectly fine. Please fix this it makes it extremely hard to enjoy or make a GLMV (Gacha Life Music Video) when this happens. Please fix it."
4573,Pandora,Martin Pearson,2,1,"The app is geared towards playing stations that select the music for you, even if you have a paid subscription. Playing albums and songs on demand is possible but is buried in the interface. It takes persistence to get past the station oriented interface. Other services such as Amazon music and Spotify do this much better."
4574,Pandora,John Halle,5,6,just switched to Pandora from the other choices. really enjoy it. no commercials between songs. and really like the ability to shuffle between your stations. allows me to enjoy all my favorite genres at the same time without constantly having to change back and forth between stations. keep it up!!!
4575,Pandora,Ryan Moss,1,170,Beware of the android app for Pandora. Developer purposely has the app not play a big variety of music so dumb people will pay for the app. Only the android app has these so called issues that should not be a problem. It's like that for a reason not because the dev can't fix it. Try the app on computer or xbox and you will see the difference in the variety of music to your stations. The phone app uses shady cash grabbing tactics that are super obvious
4576,Pandora,Joshua Hendon,1,1,You clearly are not reading your reviews. Long time user but the android app has a ton of new issues and you wont respond to them. Your can'd response is not necessary or wanted. You have one month to fix them or I will move on forever. I cannot even listen to a full song without it forceclosing.
4577,Pandora,Darren Clevenger,2,19,used to love it. been having probelms with having to force stop the app because it constantly opens in the background. then i went through the reviews and all they ever say is go to technical support. should have been fixed a long time ago. they dont put enough time into the application.
4578,Pandora,Eric Wolfe,1,21,"The app was cutting off the first song about half way through it and then restarting. After closing the app and trying several times, I had the same issue. I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it, now the app won't open at all. Used to be good, but is now useless."
4579,Pandora,Robert Sinclair,2,5,"I recently had to uninstall & reinstall app for it to function. After reinstall & signing into my account the app doesn't shut off when I've closed it out & after clearing all recent apps, which automatically turns off any apps. I've had to turn my phone off multiple times just to turn Pandora off & I've also starting to have the same problem with YouTube after this started with the reinstalled Pandora app."
4580,Pandora,Greg Gaines,5,2,So it was only playing music for a few seconds and then shutting down. I uninstalled the app then reinstalled and this fixed the problem hopefully this helps others.
4581,Pandora,River Song,1,24,"DO NOT sign up for the premium service! I did a trial and when it ended, I did not renew it, and ALL of my radio stations I've had for several years are now gone. Don't waste your money. I am so pissed off right now and I'm searching other services to use instead of Pandora. Also, the support team site does not exist."
4582,Pandora,ãƒˆãƒ¬ã‚¤ãƒ« Toreiru XD,1,1,can't ever really believe you guys as Pandora.. When will you never have or anyone pay for premium that is still limited.. your a big joke... everyone i dont care. but dont waste ur time or money on old and overplayed music or app as Pandora... !!!! literally buy YouTube app if it means to have as much fake replays as they come... there quality isnt as poor and has nuthin new and hasnt or ever will.. like Pandora.. but at least YouTube you get that and actually new releases!!!
4583,Pandora,V. Abshire,1,12,"What happened to the x button that I could use to close the app?? Now I can't exit it without being forced to restart my phone. Annoying as heck, I will probably uninstall if not fixed. Has only been happening since the last update, shame too since it's a good app otherwise"
4584,Pandora,Clara Daniels,5,64,"TOTALLY AWESOME!!! I Have The *Alexa By Amazon*, and I Never Ever have A Problem With Pandora!! With Or Without The Alexa I Just Love It!! I Love Music and Gospel Is All I Play, and You Can Make As Many Radio Channels As You Like By Choosing Different Artist. No Matter Your Preferences, It's Phenomenal, Very, Very Few Commercials!!! I Would Have Given It 10, But You Stop At 5 So I'll Just Add Some For You. Nope The Didnt Pay Me, Nope!! PANDORA â˜†â˜†â˜†â˜†â˜†â˜†â˜†â˜†â˜†â˜†"
4585,Pandora,Andrew Worstell,1,6,"If you upgrade to premium, you lose the ability to modify your shuffle. You can shuffle everything, or nothing. Worst money ever spent. Why would you downgrade the app by taking away such an important feature, but only for the ones who pay?"
4586,Pandora,JESUS FERNANDEZ,1,0,DO NOT SUBSCRIBE !!!! I've had a pandora account for many years and am trying to cancel my subscription because I've found way better. they will make you jump through hoops and different web pages to unsubscribe which im still not able to do but the upgrade button is easily accessible ???? dirty tactics from companies who can care less about their customers.
4587,Pandora,Doug Kooy,1,2,when first came out was great. now song ad song ad song song ad ad. no I'm not paying for ad free. pay for this pay for that. how about great service without. also drains battery when not using. yes I've tried this tried that. I'm not the only Android this happens too. Pandora was good......back in the day
4588,Pandora,Rebecca Theiss,5,1,"This is a great free music app. My only complaint is when it plays music that has nothing to do with the station I'm listening to. For example, I'll be listening to Disney and it will play P!nk. Or pop while I only have musical stations in my shuffle. Other than that though, I love it and have been using it pretty much daily for more than 4 years."
4589,Pandora,Marcel Williams,2,8,"Why did the new update make it so that the app can't be closed unless you go to your phones settings? The app is continuously running in the background? Love the app outside of that, plus I just upgraded to premium, so this is a let down."
4590,Pandora,Julie G,2,7,"this app paid version used to be a 5. NOT ANYMORE! When i close it, it still keeps opening up, runs in background and drains battery! went to website and there is no where to find answer. i may have to CANCEL our TWO paid subscriptions we have had over 3 yrs. so sad."
4591,Pandora,Shawn Ranaldo,5,1,I love pandora because you can search up any song you want from their new update. I also like that you can get the free trial once a month. The thing that I dont like is that if you dont have the trial then you have to watch a 15 second video. I think pandora would be a lot better if they showed you music videos.Overall I think pandora is a great app to listen to music with.
4592,Pandora,De W,3,0,"feature request, bug: please get rid of notification bar for ""pandora is ready to be launched automatically by your.."" car icon and message. if i go in the settings to disable it, then it disables the necessary notifications like what song is playing, skip, like, on the pull down home and lock screen. its annoying to see it always there. it should be enough that we switched it on, but we dont need a constant notification that its armed and ready."
4593,Pandora,Matthew Richeal,3,14,"I've always really enjoyed Pandora and decided to get Premium and give it a shot. I really enjoy not having any ads but I won't stay subscribed. Being able to save songs offline is an awesome feature, especially for when you don't have service but many songs that I want to save, aren't available due to licensing issues. Pandora Premium is definitely a long way away from Spotify or Apple Music. Maybe eventually it'll be my mail music application."
4594,Pandora,Al Duque,1,1,I'm a paying for this. constantly freezing it shuts off all the time constantly getting interrupted with the premium add if you look for a song it sends to the premium page then you have to shut the app off to get to your stations .( its a pain to do this if you're driving) some songs can not be repeated. all these issues are new all because their pushing the premium membership I do not recommend this app.my service renews at the end of this month if it's not fixed I will cut it off.
4595,Pandora,Pinual Pomeroy,2,0,"It used to be that Pandora was great and I could recommend it to anyone. But with the constant interface changes and getting rid of the options that made it better than its competitors, that's no longer the case. It's impossible to add content to a station via the app or the web interface. Their technicians are snide and unhelpful when you submit a support ticket. The only upside is it's cheap to get rid of ads, but I certainly haven't felt like a valued customer in years."
4596,Pandora,Lil Jen,5,1,"I love Pandora and I give 5 stars but there's a problem, every time I have to leave the qpp it stay where you left off which that's cool but the problem is when I go back on Pandora and plays the song that I left off on It does this slow motion where the singer sounds like a deep demon voice so what I do is either log out and on or play a different song and then go back to the song I that I left on and see if it's doesn't again sometimes it does again I'm hoping you guys can fix this plz & ty."
4597,Pandora,Tanisha Jackson,1,1,"As of a few weeks ago my Pandora app has been freezing. When playing a song it stops and when I go open the app it skips to the next song. It has not played a whole song it about 3 weeks. Guess, I am going to have to renew my subscription with Spotify. Pandora you need to fix your app!! Signed the frustrated Android user!"
4598,Pandora,David McKinley,2,6,"Annoying music app that was the clear favorite ... Earlier versions focused on a great selection and suggestions of music... but now the number of ads to tell me to be ad-free and the constant necessity to ""Force-Close"" due to the app guessing I want it on or just staying on to drain the battery is obnoxious to the point, I'm done with it."
4599,Pandora,Sean G,5,14,"I never wrote a review on this app until now. I'm SUPER PISSED that you REMOVED the ""X"" button that used to allow you to CLOSE the app from the lock screen widget or the notification shade. Now i have to UNLOCK the phone and click several times to close the app completely. Why would you take away such a USEFUL feature. PLEASE.... bring it back..... NOW! UPDATE... THEY BROUGHT IT BACK!"
4600,Pandora,Mr. Bobcat,3,3,"I have been using Pandora for many, many years. its an excellent service. But lately, it has started playing more, and more ads, its almost as bad as broadcast radio now. Fact: too many ads drives people away."
4601,Pandora,Lorrie Marshall,5,2,"I like that I can create my own personal music ie;King Crimson,Fleetwood Mac Reba McKentire, Chicago, Cat Steven's, and the music I love from home,ie; C&K,Kakapana,Olamana, Hapa, Peter Moon Band,BRO. IZ, , and my favorite song "" Sudden Rush ""-"" Night Marchers "" Aloha Nui Loa Lorrie"
4602,Pandora,Cileece Middleton,1,0,"I loved my Premium subscription and then in the past few months it has replaced my playlists with its own(which can not be removed), removed many of my downloaded songs with no heads up, and my billing through google play is all messed up. Thankfully I use paypal for my google play or I would be screwed in trying to cancel. Switching today."
4603,Pandora,Laz,1,35,Come across a lot of annoying bugs lately. Can't double tap on earbuds to repeat anymore. Connecting to chromecast has problems. Still no dedicated 19:8 aspect ratio support. Randomly goes offline. Love the radio + sleep timer but I might move on to Spotify Edit: I went to Google Play Music
4604,Pandora,Frank Middleton,2,3,Loved the app until earlier this week when it just started crashing for no apparent reason. I have tried several fixes to no avail. Looks like i will have to delete and right now uncertain if i will install again.
4605,Pandora,Kelly Welti,1,4,"ever since the latest update, when I try to go to Pandora from my app screen, I am told to install it. Then I go to Google play and hit open because the other thing says UNINSTALL. I have to do this every time!"
4606,Pandora,Claris V,1,5,annoying af. they play the damn commerical to upgrade what feels like every other song enjoy nearly crashing on to on coming traffic because a simple skip has to confirm that you dont want to upgrade. You blink to long the screen pops up to upgrade AND FOR WHAT?! They play the same 5 songs and try some weird options in between. I'd rather listen to babies cry. I appreciate you going hard to upgrade but it's annoying as hell. spotify is lit tho.
4607,Pandora,Eli Guerra,1,3,lately the app has been pausing during any song played. Maybe 15 to 20 seconds play and it pauses. Upon exiting the app it will pause while connected to my cars bluetooth. never had issues til now. does anyone know the fix for this?
4608,Pandora,Kolleen Young,1,14,well i did like the app even with adds twice in a row as well as the adds i can't help but watch and than the totally random music that has nothing to with what im listening to but now there's no way for me to shut the app down without going in and clearing all my running items. so yeah the apps now just annoying enough for me to say bye. it's been fun (kind of).
4609,Pandora,Sydney,2,6,"Its okay for what it does. I'd really like to get rid of live music and also get feedback options on ads. Adam and Eve for instance.... I'm not offended by sex toys, but its embarrassing when it comes on around other people. I know I can get rid of them by turning off explicit content, but then I just get a bunch of censored music which is even more annoying."
4610,Pandora,Sarah Battles,5,532,Love this app! my favorite music streaming service. Finally got a response about how to fix the buffering issue so can use it again. So far it all seems to be working perfectly.
4611,Pandora,Richard Fenimore,2,4,"This app has been great to use until the latest update. now it no longer responds to actions from my bluetooth devices like pause, skip, replay. Makes using it in my car or with my headphones very obnoxious"
4612,Pandora,Andrew W,2,2,"Uninstalled because the app uses my notification system every time a song changes and constantly dings my notifications during a song when im not doing anything. I thought it was and Android Beta issue but this is an app issue. Plus, I enjoyed my stations if I put in an artist it will play similar. Premium just plays the artist. Ill go back to Spotify."
4613,Pandora,Auntie Momo,2,5,Crappy since the most recent update. it keeps shutting off on its own. Im having to reinstall the dang thing to work for a couple of days only to have to do it again. What the hell? I dont pay for this to happen?!!
4614,Pandora,Jason Fox,5,2,while listening with the screen off i was able to skip songs by holding the volume up button. I Factory Reset my phone and now the feature does not work but it works with the volume button on my headphones. Also having great difficulty with streaming over Straight Talk AT&T network.
4615,Pandora,Chris Cactus,4,1,"I just hate the gross ""sexy"" ads, and it has some connection problems even when I have good wifi or data strength. But besides that, love the app, just wish I could afford premium."
4616,Pandora,Uyen Vitti,1,1,Unbelievable. How is it there is no off button for Android? For god's sake think about this before you release an update. It's robbery to pay money for this sub par experience.
4617,Pandora,Brandon Goodreau,3,1,"alright....except for when the app freezes and restarts at least 3 times a week. and I'm not sure why I cant tell the app to play only explicit and no radio edits, I like my music how it was made"
4618,Pandora,Daisha White,2,1,I downloaded the new update and all of a sudden every time i try to click the app and listen it says the application isnt installed. It only works if i go through play store to my apps/games and click opem there. If there is a way to fix it I don't know.
4619,Pandora,Eliezer Martinez,3,2,I have 2 be honest I have been using Pandora+ for many years & I absolutely love it & I love that radio experience I love discovering new songs however I have 2 biggest issues U need 2 fix ASAP 1st Y did U remove the casting feature? I no longer cant cast Pandora anymore on any of my devices especially my Bluetooth speaker which has a built-in casting feature now Im forced 2 use Spotify premium & 2nd U need 2 allow me 2 download any station individually not all of them which is Y i removed 2â­
4620,Pandora,Cali Hemphill,1,5,"They made the subscription cancellation process WAY too difficult. fortunately I am technologically inclined and can understand, but if an elderly or disabled person accidentally subscribed to Pandora Premium they would no doubt get taken advantage of. awful. Shame on you, pandora."
4621,Pandora,Juan Gonzalez,1,11,UPDATE 4/13 upgraded to pandora one. ABSOLUTE GARBAGE BUFFERING AND SLOW AS HELL SEE YOU PANDORA CANCELLING SUBSCRIPTION Good app and content but it's gotten slower and slower and slower. One thing that hasn't gotten slower is the ads. Ads upon ads upon ads. Try to look at the artwork for the album-ads. Skip songs-ads. Login-ads that's why I dont have pandora one too many issues with free app cant justify supporting them. Now that Sirius Xm bought them we'll see if theres a change.
4622,Pandora,Tara Lynn Harrison,2,0,"I have always like pandora but after my last update, it will kick me out of the app in the middle of the first song playing. I'm not a big fan of this app anymore!!!! Can I take back the update I did, so I can listen to my favorite songs?"
4623,Pandora,Shawna Stockman,2,5,"pandora breaks constantly, wont play some of my songs . it plays them one day and wont the next. im getting fed up w/all the time ive spent trying to get a song to play, shuffles through all my songs while saying buffering them stops working. there's a double standard here, i pay automaticly every month but pandora doesnt work right. i get the sign 'unable to retrieve music at this time' , often. if it would just do what it's supposed to it would be a good app. sorry to say. it used to work"
4624,Pandora,Daniel Johnson,1,14,Just like every other app having to update it for no other reason then to take up space on my phone. Cause now I can't even listen to anything without this dumb app crashing even though I have the latest version of this app.
4625,Pandora,Greg Ficek,3,1,I've been happy with the app for quite a while... Until this last update. No none of my Bluetooth devices will control the app. Looks like something got screwed up.
4626,Pandora,Ann Byrd,2,1,"What did y'all do? All the sudden it's skipping by itself until my skips are used up. I didn't get to listen to songs I wanted to, then stuck listening to ones I don't ðŸ¤¨"
4627,Pandora,Napoleon Pinos,1,1,keeps crashing in the middle of a song and when in relaunch it it's a new song. Tried uninstalling and installing it. Turned the phone off and back on. Nothing works
4628,Pandora,EquestrianForever16 Merp,2,2,"did an update and now it wont connect to my headphones. in ordee to change the song on Pandora i have to sign into my phone, go into the app and change it. i got premium so i can listen to it at work without using data but once on the offline mode you Don't get much music to listen go per album. or if you download a different genre or something it still plays the same songs from every other album. can be a pain in the butt"
4629,Pandora,Lea Clark,3,1,free trial for no commercials are not true. I continue to get ads and commercials. I will not be purchasing as free for $9.99. not worth paying for more ads.
4630,Pandora,John Saari,3,1,Good app when it works. After the last update it no longer works in my truck with Ford Sync. Simply refuses to connect. This happens too often after an update.
4631,Pandora,Tina Manning,1,1,I updated a few days ago and this app is draining my battery and it's getting stuck or frozen on my notifications??? I love this app but it's not acting right?
4632,Pandora,Chris Evans,1,4,"Constant problems. sometimes won't connect to audiocast speakers without restarting app several times. sometimes it says it's connected and streaming but is still playing on phone and not speakers. when it does ""work"" it starts to skip or freeze after a few songs. don't have the same problems streaming from plex or YouTube. Also not a fan the it instantly starts playing when opened and brings up an ad, makes using it annoying."
4633,Pandora,Megan Thomas,1,3,why am I paying for an app that only halfway works after the last 2 updates?? This used to be my go-to for music but I'm thinking about switching to another service
4634,Pandora,Christopher Ferguson,2,1,where's nipsey hussle music when I go to the station it plays all kinds of different genres except on his funeral day it was hittin so what's up with that as a longtime user I'm extremely upset I'm a big nipsey fan and expect to hear his music on there not everyone else music that's why I canceled my subscription
4635,Pandora,lambo superleggera,2,1,"Not sure what's going on, but it keeps stopping after about a minute or less into a song. I've restarted the app and the phone and still keeps stopping. It's been going on for a few days now."
4636,Pandora,Alexandra Santos,1,7,if I could rated lower I would. I HATE the fact that every time I launch app it goes offline mode. I was paying a monthly subscription which of I just cancel and not planning on keep on wasting my money with apps like this. it used to be Good. now I just straight up trash.
4637,Pandora,paeonia321 Z,3,1,"If you could not automatically start playing music when I open the app, that'd be great. Maybe I'm in the middle of a store and want to bookmark a song they're playing, not draw attention to myself."
4638,Pandora,A Google user,3,8,"I hate FACEBOOK with an extem passion, if I need to have a Facebook account to be with pandora, you can forget it!!! Facebook should not be a requirement!!! I paid for "" premium"" and NOT receiving it. what's the problem????!!!! Ok I got the premium. I guess it was a bit slow. It would be great for pandora to speed up its systems. Thank you.."
4639,Pandora,David Ricks,1,4,"Really annoying that the music doesn't actually pause when I hit the button. It changes to a play icon but the music keeps going. Fix it. - A month later and they still haven't fixed this simple bug, sad."

4642,Pandora,Mark Miller,3,0,Very flaky in my 2015 Buick Lacrosse. Sometimes won't connect. Now stops on the message Acquiring Pandora and doesn't show the station name. Have to switch to another station. Can't get a message to tech support.
4643,Pandora,Miss Tiffanee,1,1,This is the 3nd time where cancelling my membership results in the app performing badly. Its like youre trying to force me to pay. The quality of this app has declined.
4644,Pandora,pink diamond,2,1,"why i am paying a month for premium service when the service doesnt work on all devices?? update to work across all devices i login on. like repeat, previous song.."
4645,Pandora,Barbaro Armijos,3,1,"I would give Pandora a 5 except for every single time I try to look at the screen ,change the song, check anything out and get some information I have to get hit with the 30 second :start the free trial right now that's stupid black screen. I'm pretty sure you could come back maybe send that out once an hour or twice an hour not after every single time somebody touches your screen. that's called trying to bully us into buying your product which I'll admit is great but so is Sirius and Spotify@"
4646,Pandora,A Google user,3,1,i dont know why this app isn't fixed by now but it needs fixed i depend on my music to work and it is very angering to restart the app and it skip the song i was on an then have to change stations just for it to happen again. please fix asap
4647,Pandora,Ryan Maas,3,1,"I enjoy listening to Pandora, but there are flaws. First of all, it automatically goes to a station when you get on the app. I do not like this. If it is possible to disable this and I just don't know how, I apologize. The most infuriating part for me is the fact that they are constantly putting some of my favorites songs on radio only, meaning you listen to random songs in the same genre, and the song may randomly pop up. For now, I think 3 stars fits."
4648,Pandora,ForceForGood,2,2,"A couple of strange bugs. After upgrading from the S7 to S10+, I've noticed Pandora will sometimes automatically launch into ""Offline mode"". Also, after closing the app, the Pandora icon will remain in the status bar causing me to have to force close. Probably the worst thing is whenever I first launch the app with my headphones plugged in, the volume will be at MAX level. I've had premium service for years without issue on the S7, hoping for updates for this phone."
4649,Pandora,Naomi Austin,1,1,after I signed up and then tried to get in to the app it told me to sign up and then I went out of the app and then I went back in and it went straight to the sign in page. Pandora does not have what they say they do I signed up on my other device and it was as easy as pie for unlike now.
4650,Pandora,Eric Ken line,1,8,"I do enjoy music let's get that out of the way first. What I don't like is the app constantly shutting down for no apparent reason and this is not the first time that is happened, nor the 2nd........ nor the 30th but every god damn day and its infuriatingly annoying. Thanks for helping me find spotify and pay for their premium account!!"
4651,Pandora,Christyna Evans,2,1,Everytime I exit the app the song stops a minute later. When I go back it goes to another song. I've uninstalled & installed the app several times.
4652,Pandora,skylar messore,4,7,"This is one of my favorite music apps. You can make stations that have your favorite artists and they even put in music related to them.. However, ads are shown very frequently which can get very very annoying. I beileve you have to pay for no ads which in my opinion is ridiculous... Pretty decent all though."
4653,Pandora,Jacob Olsen,1,1,"Free version offers too many ads. More than one of the ads nearly made me vomit due to the awful noises they were making. I wanted to give pandora another chance, unfortunately it failed. I recommend almost any other listening service as the ads will be less intrusive and offer more than just a handful of songs per Playlist."
4654,Pandora,Pamela Jensen,2,0,"I've been using Pandora for many years, but with this new update, I can't close it at all. I have to reboot my phone just to close the app and get it out of my notification bar. Very disappointed in this update."
4655,Pandora,Wes Shanks,1,9,"I'm sorry but goodbye Pandora. I have used Pandora for years. Last month I upgraded to Premium and the annoying adds I thought would go away. Pandora was merged with Sirusxm and isn't the same. I'm sorry to say, I won't use this app anymore. I tried using it on a roadtrip over the weekend and noticed so many songs say radio only. These are songs accessible through almost any streaming music app for the same price. I guess we get less from Pandora now so goodbye."
4656,Pandora,Daniel Lesieur,3,1,"i know it's ""free"" radio, but getting 4 ads immediately when opening the app when all I'm trying to do is select a radio station is a bit annoying, especially when then finally selecting a radio station then opens up another ad... it's bad enough after every 1-3 songs (depending on the length of them) is another ad, or more, and that the ad's volume is considerably louder than the music I'm already listening to so then my ears get blasted. Pandora has gone from AWESOME to just ok."
4657,Pandora,Harold Moss,2,4,App is very glitchy and its making me want to uninstall. I own a galaxy note 9 and not sure whats going on with the app and it opening itself in the background. After the most recent updates the app consistently wakes itself up and runs in the background at random. A pandora icon banner then appears in your status bar of the last song you streamed but you cant close it or swipe it away. You end up force closing the app.
4658,Pandora,Mike,2,1,"I really like pandora. I have pandora premium and its nice to build playlists. But lately, when I go to play a song I want to listen to it skips right over it and plays a different song on an album or playlist. This is very frustrating as I have no idea why I bother paying for premium if the app is just going to skip what I want to listen to. please fix this error and you will have a higher rating. Thanks"
4659,Pandora,Emily May,5,6,"it's a little complicated at first, but then you get a thing of it, and I deleted it and downloaded Spotify, and that one sucked compared to Pandora like legit sucked"
4660,Pandora,Julio Bello,5,2,"Excellent music and reception, but constantly receive unwanted ads but thats my fault. Can't afford to up date! And that's why you privide other oppotunities but why you cant' give listening free not without the adds. I don't understand but you must have contacts with those adds. Talking it through I see where you are coming from but I still can't afford it. Because of the adds that I get through basic Pandora I am giving you a four stars. I am pleased the music that streams on my Andoid is great"
4661,Pandora,Nero 3S,3,1,"always work fine til now. crashes every minute unless i leave it running on the foreground. samsungs ""device care"" keeps tagging it as a battery hog and it causes frequent wake ups."
4662,Pandora,Marshall Currie,5,0,"It played ALL of the old country music that I love : Jonny & Jack, Charlie & Ira The Louvin Brothers, Ray Price, Hank Williams,The Wilburn Brothers, et al . I LOVE THIS STATION ! !"
4663,Pandora,Alki Vid.s,1,2,"Ive had Pandora since 2010, through there. I have tried spotify, solid app, but stuck to pandora. Definitley will stop using pandora now. I tried unsubscribing from a free premium subscription that came with some jlab headphones I bought, but apparently I can only unsubscribe from a computer, that I dont have. There's no reason in this day and age for you not to be able to unsubscribe from the app. Unless they just want to try to keep subscriptions by making it hard for people to unsubscribe."
4664,Pandora,mario luigi,1,0,Every time I try to use this something goes wrong. Used to love the algorithm and paid for premium. Tried to give it another chance and this time it won't stream to Chrome cast.
4665,Pandora,Zachary Bingle,2,1,"this app can not stay running, if multiple app are running. closes for no reason. does not play music from the artist selected."
4666,Pandora,Cesar Flores,2,2,since last update whenever the screen turns of or when i open a new app or use keyboard theres is a pause on the music playing not long but its like it skips.basically when ever i touch phone and pandora is open there is a pause or skip in music. sucks i cant touch my phone at all when pandora is playing now. is there a fix for this?been a pandora user for many years. and yes my connecting is fine both on 4g and wifi all other apps dont do this.
4667,Pandora,Anthony C,1,0,"always been decent, 3-4 stars. however, over the past few days the app has been playing one song and then one ad. really pushing their 30 day free trial. bye pandora."
4668,Pandora,Amanda Wray,3,5,"I have always loved pandora! but in the past mo th the app is force closing itself. At first I thought it was just when the ads would come on and they were killing it, but now with ad free the app is still shutting down and I can't even get through 1 whole song"
4669,Pandora,Alondra Diaz,1,2,I will never use Pandora again! I got Pandora Premium and I couldn't even enjoy my music because it kept pausing everytime I got out of the app. I can't even cancel my subscription on my phone! It sucks that you have to do everything on an actual computer!!! I am very upset with this app. Never using it again
4670,Pandora,Tim Rogers,1,0,Pandora eliminated the quit button. I can close the app from my recent apps page but then the notification bar shotcut is still present! it is infuriating! I just want it gone when I am not listening!
4671,Pandora,Alex Timm,5,0,"my X is back, yeah pandora! love this app. Jesus Loves you all! Learn about him and hus love and you will be happy!-4-20-19. loved Pandora for a long time. Now after update I can't close the app becayse there is no x in the corner like there has always been. must force close. only app on my phone i have to force close. Can you say stupid!4-14-19"
4672,Pandora,Adam Ali,5,2,kinda hard to use at first but when you figure it out you realize how easy it is. I totally recommend this app. it has free music.
4673,Pandora,M mi,5,1,I grew up in the 70s same as the classic rock was being just on radio fresh. .With 8 tracks; the album then cassette never stopping albums. Real to real. then crappy dvds. It lost the sound of home grown sounds. In high school playing in aband I was the drummer. Made a little money. when gas was 75cent a gallon. Cops pulled you over. They took your pot ( Mexico) dirt weed. And poured at your beer. Then sent you home. I learned how to drive intoxicated. That you no DWI..In the end good old days.
4674,Pandora,Sierra Mings,1,3,"I have used Pandora for 10+ years now..... and never in them years til now do i wanna stop paying for it and find something else. the app always crashes, i pay for unlimited skips and dont get them. i have data but it wont play when I'm not connected to wifi (yes i have checked my settings.) i am no longer impressed with an app i have encouraged people to use for years for MANY reasons...."
4675,Pandora,josh miller,2,2,"keeps pausing every few seconds, this was a good app when it first came out. after updated nothing but problems. I just got a new phone so it aint the problem, also reinstalled the app, restarted it, still no fix."
4676,Pandora,lycanyan 8102,4,0,"Pandora is GREAT so easy to control and easy access to great songs and great artist the one and ONLY problem is its music licence it is not able to play certain songs like I see fire or wanna see my pencil but with great music, playlists, and no shuffle play it's Great 4 Stars"
4677,Pandora,Thomas Mears,3,1,"it was all good till today. i can't even play music bc it says that my ""session timed out"" even though i just opened the app"
4678,Pandora,Carlene Palmer,5,2,I love love love this app. I don't even mind the ads. my kiddos love dancing to the music and we love using the wonderful alarm clock feature ðŸ™Œâ¤
4679,Pandora,Chris Laws,3,2,good yet app keeps changing my ability to shut off streaming and way to often wants me to sieng up for some free trials. playback of unfavored songs likes extra are also seemingly coming to a attention level. Yet thank you all vary much for providing a app that is yousible and makes for a true time off of so much garb of socialized antisocial bereavements. Pandora services has helped me gratefully help myself and others I hope to remember ourselves and days when the outer worlds of life were a u
4680,Pandora,Edgar Carmona,5,8,"I think Pandora is an amazing app it gives you all the music that you want and keeps it all organized and set for you mostly, anytime of the day. And it works perfectly for you could listing to your songs and it's a really good app for songs AND the really cool part that it doesn't seem to give you a lot of notifications"
4681,Pandora,k merry,5,6,Pandora is the best it plays that come from deep inside you your emotions thoughts of friends girls future Past it comes out through your heart that is if you have a heart I refer to mr. bill Detweiler chomo and yes I have hatred in my heart events long ago that changed my life forever and he threw it in my face like a fool get ready fool your victims are all around you and you don't see what you've done to them but I know we're not through Proctor see you soon Puppet Master!!!!
4682,Pandora,Wolfie Koarou,3,0,"Everything is all good, I just wisj there was a way to customize your advertisements because i dont want to hear about Chik-fil-a since they're so against the LGBTQ+ community."
4683,Pandora,Ben,1,4,Lastest update took away the ability to close the app. Just sits in my notification bar. Really annoying. The app constantly running will kill the battery as well.
4684,Pandora,Johnathan Mango,3,2,pandora is a great streaming services. sometimes you run unto license issues but for the most part its great. im giving a 3 star though because some of the basic features DO NOT WORK. I shouldn't have to clear my cache and save multiple times to get a song to move to the top on a playlist I've made. It's very annoying
4685,Pandora,Typhani Lee,4,3,"Almost perfect. I love the thumbprint radio, but WHY, for the love of God, does it like ALL VERSIONS of a song when i give it a thumbs up?! I DO NOT want to hear the super long and weird remixes. I don't want the radio edits. I don't want the live version either!! Just stop!"
4686,Pandora,Hazel Evans,3,1,"hey I know this is too much to ask but can you please, PLEASE. Take broken by lund off of radio so I can listen to it without having to have a station. and I am a big fan of pandora, but I think taking that off radio would make the app a whole lot better."
4687,Pandora,daniel harlan,1,3,DON'T USE THIS APP USE SPOTIFY! After trying to save my mom from cancer for 4 month the ads change to hospital cancer advertisement even after a year. All I can say about that is I pray to god their family get's deadly cancer as a constant reminder how fd-up the advertisement tracking algorithm is. I will never treat anyone that works at pandora as a human being just another piece of shyt corporation that need to be closed. FOOK YOU PANDORA! STILL DOING IT! Hasn't change still! STIIL DOING IT!
4688,Pandora,Hazel Washington,5,1,When the music starts playing you just can't help singing or dance .Such much to choose from ? . Pandora has it all. Thanks Pandora!!!!.
4689,Pandora,Jerome Davis,5,4,"really every time.any star marked, y'all want to know why?

4690,Pandora,Phillip F,1,1,The app will not update itself with the music i collected from my Pandora account. i hear more variety on my desktop than my phone. i have to go into my phone and recollect music that i already have in my library. And I'm paying for this? not Cool and not for long
4691,Pandora,jeremy m,1,0,I want to listen to what I want to listen to if you can't do that say so every time I play an oldies song it plays another older song behind it when you play this shity app it plays signs you don't want even if you're playing a playlist
4692,Pandora,Anon ymous,1,0,Was offered three months of premium free had issues with sign up. support was quick to say they fixed then ads started after 1 month. so stopped using been happy with Amazon music thinking about uninstalling.
4693,Pandora,Fam M.,3,0,The notifications suck. It ALWAYS gets stuck on my panel and I cant delete or close it without force closing the app. This should have been fixed by now. S9+
4694,Pandora,Nicole Groves,1,1,"Can not switch screens or apps or even allow my screen to go to sleep with out this app shutting off. Used to love Pandora and i even pay the premium subscription and now I can't even enjoy what I am paying for. Extremely disappointed, about to pull my subscription and give someone else my business."
4695,Pandora,Sara Umbreit,3,0,"Have been subscribed to Pandora plus for years and love it! With the recent update, every time my screen locks, the app closes. Please fix this!"
4696,Pandora,Dragonboy heirtothedragonthrone,1,3,This is so horrible no matter how many times I try to make an account it refuses to accept it and takes me back to the beginning screen and I hate it so much. Just to let the creators of this app know and should not have been created.
4697,Pandora,Will Rose,3,0,What is wrong with this app? Let's see if it works after a reinstall. Trying the $4.99 trial and still get offers for the same subscription.
4698,Pandora,PopaSmurf,3,0,"I used to love listening to my favorite music, but now not so much. For some reason I have lost the ability to replay music. Bummed and disappointed!!!"
4699,Pandora,Kyle McDonald,5,10,"Really? Not sure what else to say about the Program since it's Certainly, if not; The Most popular, Frequently used, Well known app. among 18-35yrs. Equally and fairfully to the likes of Tech giants such as Pinterest, Spotify, Snapchat.Just the sheer number of total App subscribers is very unusual! (good way)If you are not familiar with said Application, Youve prob lost all ur marbles! You may hav been subject to a less forturnate means and/or more than likely living under a lrg Stone?! Lol"
4700,Pandora,Michele Travis,5,5,Pandora's an awesome radio station especially if you go on the listen listen to shuffle and don't mind me eyes but if you look for the skip bar you can skip it in a few seconds!
4701,Pandora,Go0gle Us3r,5,49,"I use Pandora all the time and love it but lately the notification won't go away!!! If I close out of the app there's still a play menu notification and now I can't swipe it away. If I'm done with the app it should disappear. I have to go to settings and turn off notifications then turn it back on to make it go away, ANNOYING. When this is fixed I'll update my rating. UPDATE: I got in contact with Pandora and this isn't an issue anymore. back to enjoying the app!"
4702,Pandora,Dawn Hatchett,2,0,can't edit my own playlists? only one person can listen at a time? what the hell am I paying for? I could listen to the free version with less hassle.
4703,Pandora,A Google user,3,80,Loved it now I'm starting to hate it!! I hate that it takes FOREVER to load anymore. I hate that it constantly cuts in and out or just says it cannot connect. My connection is just fine. Sick of paying $10 a month for something that works less than half the time!! The free music apps work 100% of the time so why can't Pandora especially since I pay for it!?!?!?! One more chance and I'm cancelling this subscription!!
4704,Pandora,Jeanette Henderson,2,82,"first , I do like the music, BUT the ads every couple of songs is annoying and not to mention your constant pestering to ""try the free 30 day trial of pandora "" commercials is going to make me delete the app. let me explain this I DO NOT WANT TO TRY THE DAMN TRIAL. if I did I would have done it. but noooo, you just keep asking every time I change my channel. I will leave your ass and go to something else if it doesn't tone down . seriously. stop the damn harrassment. I DONT WANT TO TRY IT."
4705,Pandora,Donald Kelley,1,359,"I love Pandora! I especially love the way it keeps offering songs I have given a ""thumbs down"". Or, the way it plays ads about ""ad-free"" listening, over and over and over. Or, the fact that it has over 400 Rush songs, but can't give me any. Just a great little program for its greedy company (just like you'd expect)... And what's with the Fade Out? You are cutting the ends off my music!! That's why you have the new commercial begging people to come back; you've pissed 'em all off!!!"
4706,Pandora,Zach Bardes,1,131,"Used to be my go-to for music. I never even tried iheart radio or spotify because i loved pandora. After the last update however, it is the worst app on my phone. It is slow and crashes every time i use it. It will play 1 song and then crash on the next one every single time. I have uninstalled and downloaded again with no improvements. If this isnt fixed then i am switching to a competitor. I wont risk taking my eyes off the road to re-open an app every 4 minutes. It's unacceptable. Please fix!"
4707,Pandora,Adam Northrup,1,1482,"I'm so tired of having to force kill the app. When i stop using the app, I'll swipe away the notification, but it comes back. After that, it can't be swiped away, and the X doesn't close it (or do anything). I'm forced to hold down on the notification, hit the ""i"" in the top right, and force close the app. I this multiple times per day. It's annoying."
4708,Pandora,Cass Dente,2,47,"since the update, it's been very glitchy. i've had to out my phone on silent as the app will just open at random and start playing. led to some embarrassing moments at work. never used to do that and i'm pretty upset, i pay for premium and i'm not liking this new glitch updating to add that i've restarted my phone, and i've also uninstalled/reinstalled the app and it's still doing this."
4709,Pandora,Melancholy Soda,3,167,"The music options are great and the way to get Pandora Premium is easy and I like it. But I ran into a problem. The songs will not play. It looks like its loading from the notification when you exit the app but its not saying ""buffering"" when you go into the app. I have cleared all my screens, restarted my phone, and checked to see if I needed to update the app but nothing worked."
4710,Pandora,Celeste Johnson,2,49,"after years of them asking for my review... I have always loved pandora algorithm. I can always find music for the right occasion or mood. I cant stand the UI tho.you cant do anything ""at a glance"". I have to click the album art x3 before I can click the ""I'm tired of this song"" button because the ads keep popping up. theres no easy way to get to that menu. AND I'm still waiting for a car/driving dashboard. Wake up, pandora! you're driving your user base away by not listening to our needs."
4711,Pandora,A Google user,5,34,"This App Is The Greatest, I Love This Music Streaming App. Update: The Bug Is Fixed And Pandora Is Up And Running Again."
4712,Pandora,tashia zimmerman,4,39,"I absolutely Pandora. It's easy to use. Has a great interface. I have Pandora premium so i don't have to deal with commercials. I absolutely hate them. But this last update totally ruined it. My playlists that on some, I'd been working on for years, are gone. The app icon on my phone won't work. It says that it's not installed. So i have to open my play store and open it from there. i Tried uninstalling it and I've been trying to install it for the last 20 minutes and it will not install. :("
4713,Pandora,D K,1,44,"keeps getting worse and worse by drowning you in ads in audio, imagery, and pop ups until you get the paid version. Now with this last update it wont even play through my car. I don't want to pay for Pandora because of the way they attack you with ads is exhausting. I know the paid version is ad free, but its agitated me enough not to pay for the service."
4714,Pandora,Zoe Santos,1,1,"I'd really like to use Pandora, but unfortunately they only have 2 options for gender, and neither represent me. It would be easy to add this as an option since the company seems to use gender to stereotype what each user likes, but oh well."
4715,Pandora,A Google user,1,137,"I'm having the same problem! When I click on the icon, the app won't ooen. Have to go into play store and search for the app and then click on it just to open it. When I try to just open the app from my screen, it says it's not downloaded. But it IS downloaded! This is aggravating! please look into this and fix it! I don't habe time to mess with this."
4716,Pandora,Nolan Steward,5,0,********Thanks for fixing the issue**********. after the recent update it repeats the name of the song and artist for 15 to 20 seconds for every song. extremely annoying. please fix because I love pandora and I dont want to use another music app.
4717,Pandora,Marvin Mutch,1,71,"My home screen Pandora icon does not work anymore! I keep getting a popup that says the application is not installed. So now I have to go through the Google Play Store and select open to use your service. This is a new problem and I see that others are having the same issue. Play Store shows that the Pandora app is indeed installed on my Samsung Galaxy Note 5 device, can we get this issue resolved?"
4718,Pandora,James Jackson,4,0,Loved it before the latest S9+ upgrade. Now it cuts out after playing for 3 minutes. Tried everything but doesnt wok. Wish they would fix.
4719,Pandora,Anita Harley,1,51,I love pandora but lately its been a pain. Music keep shutting down ever 40 seconds or so. I can't enjoy my ride home and My weekends cleaning because I got to keep hitting the play button every 40 seconds. I really love this app.. What is the problem and why isn't it fixed yet. I also pay for the premium and I'm to canceling that and uninstalling this app.
4720,Pandora,Aaron Ordway,2,21,"I paid for Pandora Premium, paid for a full year because all of the ads said premium is ad free. Well, it isn't. Every 3 songs I get a ""message from the artist,"" which is nothing more than an ad to tty and get you to listen to music called ""Not what I want to listen to."" And when you try and listen to a new playlist, it makes you watch an ad before you're allowed to listen to the new station."
4721,Pandora,Alex Cardenas,3,78,I love this app. I've tried other apps like spotify but I keep coming back to pandora. my only issue is that I've had to uninstall and reinstall a few times. After a certain period of time the app will start crashing within minutes of running it. It's only happened a few times over several years. But I'm so attached to this app that it really makes an impact. Hopefully this time around it works flawlessly again.
4722,Pandora,Dumbell Door,4,69,there was a slight issue with the app not being able to open but after a little bit of problem solving i got it to work. for anyone who uses android all u have to do is click on apps and drag it up to make a second icon. that icon should work and allow you to open the app. otherwise i have found no issues and i think overall it is a great music app.
4723,Pandora,Joy A M Morton,4,197,"i enjoy Pandora very much while reading, writing, cooking, meditating, over dinner conversation, background in a meeting or my Sunday School Class, traveling on the highways, in an airplane, whilst cooking, in an intimate setting, on a rainy or snowy day, during reflective moments, endless opportunities. with plenty of Variety, love the new artist I now enjoy along with the older ones. yes i recommend this app to multiple levels of family & friends (ages) LOL"
4724,Pandora,Spider Man,2,50,I guess the last update has just killed my Pandora app. For no reason at all the music vol will go up and down with my phone vol all the way up. For years now yall have keep me going at work as a mailman. So now i'm force to listen to music i have on my phone. Good thing i have to great songs. Come now i need a fix!!!
4725,Pandora,Melissa Richard,1,245,"Had a free premium trial and didn't like it at all, can't add albums or single songs in your queue you can add them after but can't play them in your queue ...can't get to your settings through the app have to go on your computer to get to the full website to do any thing on your acount. So many better music apps easier to use and have way more features."
4726,Pandora,Michael Hammond,4,25,not too bad for a free music app. some constructive criticism I like the ads makes it feel a bit more real but the annoying stopping every so often to ask if im still listening is a huge downside. See I listen while I drive and i drive for a living so i spend many hours driving and fumbling through the running apps in traffic is dangerous. That needs to be fixed. If Pandora is running of course I'm still listening.
4727,Pandora,A Google user,1,23,I have used this app for years without problems... Your latest update made the icon disappear... I have uninstalled Pandora and will try a fresh install... I hope I haven't lost all of the stations I have spent years building... This update sucks... You had a good thing going... Why did you need to screw it up?... Well I reinstalled it... No icon... Any explanation?... I'm waiting... Cue crickets...
4728,Pandora,Cory Thomas,2,18,"Buggy mess. Constantly crashing and will play randomly on its own, making me force stop the task. The stations are hardly intuitive with thumbs up or down (Drake still plays after at least 20 thumbs down). The inability to bar stations from playin specific artists or only playing studio recordings (as opposed to live recordings) is abysmal. of the few things I can give praise to, and the only reason this app gets 2 stars, is user interface. When the app does work I have no problems navigating."
4729,Pandora,BraidenIsShy y,5,4,"I personally love Pandora because it made a playlist for me, unlike soundcloud it already had all the songs by the authors and more which made me really happy. This is also my first review of anything so im glad it's for this. 10/10 Recommended to download."
4730,Pandora,A Google user,4,112,"love it! so much music! pls let me know if theres a way to delete an old account and transfer all your stations, podcasts, and playlists to a new one? i have some really fire playlists on my current account. also i dont remember my old account password so im getting notifications in my inbox for an account that i no longer use. otherwise amazing app! definitely recommend for ppl who like music like me! im constantly on this app. also fix it when it says ""song only available on radio"" pls."
4731,Pandora,patricia martin,1,50,An unethical rip off. Beware don't subsribe. Horrible customer service. You can't unsubscribe from this app unless you use a computer. Since my computer was looted during Hurricane Michael Pandora has me paying for a subscription I don't want. I perfer Spotify after using both. 2) I don't have access to computer to cancel my subscription since it's billed by Pandora. 3) Please respond with a way to cancel subscription w/out computer
4732,Pandora,Robert Short,2,34,"Have liked the app for years. However, just bought Samsung S10+ and now whenever a song buffers Pandora skips the song instead of allowing it to finish buffering. I've seen it skip about 10 songs in a row numerous times because of this. I'm a premium subscriber and if there is a song I want to hear all I normally have to do is type it in. Now, if it buffers first I can't hear it because it gets skipped."
4733,Pandora,Steven Bloom,1,30,I've been a premium subscriber for 4+ years and after the latest update I cant even get through one song with out the app force closing... the money that I've been paying for as long as I've been paying for it... I shouldn't have these issues... FIX IT! I'll change my review when I have no issues! thanks
4734,Pandora,Valerie Savitsky,3,82,"What happened to all the free hours of uninterrupted listening on Pandora basic? In January 2019 I streamed almost 2200 songs and only got about 3 free hours. I look forward to that little free bonus because I luv luv LUV Pandora. Cmon guys, throw your most devoted listeners a little bone on occasion. Used to get free hours all the time. Thanks"
4735,Pandora,Patrick Ayers,5,61,"I love Pandora. Over the course of five years, I have been using Pandora. I like, it let's me do a thumbs down for the process of elimination.it won't be played, thus the experience is that of building one's own Radio Station. I end up with only my, all time favorite songs, every time I listen. Now, I notice, the words of most songs are available while listening. I enjoy this, for my live Karaoke and learning! Pandora rocks! Thank You, Pandora, JP~"
4736,Pandora,Siew Gopaul,5,1150,"Oh yeah, Great music for any culture. .Pandora has it all .. It keeps me going all night and day at work and home. Music and Comedy, Try it and you'll love it too.. And little commercial, I even love to hear that also.. Only thing is I miss it when I travel to another country.. Only in the USA .."
4737,Pandora,Dustin Waling,5,211,"UPDATE: I did have an issue with the latest version, but support was very quick to reply with help. It was a pretty basic fix (which I had already tried, but I guess it takes a couple tries sometimes). Anyway, since I started my subscription years ago it's only gotten better, and I use it *all* the time (work, play, long drives, on phone, tablet, PC, etc. and so on). Thanks again for the help! last update broke it - crashes within 30 seconds every time now. ...this is now fixed!"
4738,Pandora,Brandon Armstrong,2,52,"""Pandora keeps stopping"" that's all that pops up now. Use to be a good app, idk what happened but, now it just says ""buffering"" then skips on every song that I've already downloaded so I can't even listen to any of it. I have the premium version as well so someone needs to hurry up and fix this, I'm not going to continue to pay for an app that i can't even use properly."
4739,Pandora,Alex Barry,1,69,"terrible! i have set my whole playlist to download, it never downloads, i individually select every single song from my playliet to download, for some reason songs still do not download, I am sitting on the subway trying to listen to music wondering why I pay for the ability to download my songs for them to play while I am in offline mode for my music to just stop... because it hits 1 song that failed to download... what am I paying for if the songs I download are not downloaded and dont work"
4740,Pandora,charles Mason,5,1511,"Pandora has been part of my life for almost a decade, and it has seen a lot of changes in that time, all good. As a Pandora Plus user, Pandora is far superior to other paid steaming services, because of how the stations play songs from a variety of artists, semi-randomly. This frees me from having to search out artists I like or play pre-arranged playlists. If that is your thing, Pandora Premium has those options. I listen to music by mood and this allows me to do that with ease."
4741,Pandora,Dawn Ellenberger,3,81,"i was paying for pandora plus, and sharing with my best friend. im not made of money, so we also shared the cost, and for the first year and a few months we could both listen at same time, on our own phones. then all of a sudden they changed it. so i upgraded to premium cause someone told me we could do that with premium. come to find out we couldnt. i have to spend $15, plus tax, a month for the family plan. thats ridiculous!!! i do love listening to commercial free music though."
4742,Pandora,Sereena Jackson,1,35,"DON'T PAY FOR A PANDORA SUBSCRIPTION!!! They aren't licensed to play a lot of music, and they don't have some popular up and coming artist. Some songs can't be played unless it comes on at random on one of their ""stations"". There is a lot of lag and buffering that I don't experience with other music streaming apps. Pandora is obsolete compared to other streaming services. I got a free trial with my earphones, after the trial is up I'm deleting the app. I've never had these issues with Spotify."
4743,Pandora,A Google user,2,42,(3/27/19) As of last update..Im only able to open the app if i long press the icon button down and select playlist. No longer able to tap icon to open. (Update 3/29/19) I found that removing Pandora from my home screen and then adding it back to my home screen fixed the issue I was having with being unable to tap icon to open.
4744,Pandora,A Google user,5,51,"why is Pandora still on in the ""background"" after i shut it off on my phone. never had to clear it out before using the square button on my phone. this is a pain bc i turn it on and off alot through out the day. onlybhad to push pause or clear all at the top of my screen but now that only pauses and goes to backgroud and eatting my data and im not even listening. please fix this."
4745,Pandora,Jess Marie,5,0,"was working great, almost daily. now it goes through the playlist in seconds without playing anything, saying unable to retrieve."
4746,Pandora,Jonathan Coppens,1,227,"I have been the biggest fan of Pandora for a while. i HAD the premium subscription but i have just cancelled it. It makes absolutely no sense to pay for an app that doesnt work anymore. I was last listening to my music in offline mode and the next time I went to open the app it says ""sorry, this content or action is not available in offline mode"". after deleting and reinstalling the app multiple times it still says the same thing. welp you just lost a customer."
4747,Pandora,david Kingsley,5,78,"While I've always loved this app, the reason I decided to upgrade to plus was the Hillary Clinton ads (great strategy), and I'm now trying out premium. It really upsets me there's no option to like individually searched songs. I'm sure thumbprint has gained a lot of popularity since its release, why not let me like a song I search for? So I have to wait on average almost two days of listening to a station for a singular song to pop up and get it into my thumbprint. Now I have unused stations."
4748,Pandora,Terrance Lawayne Brumfield,1,49,I'm highly pissed off at Pandora music right now .My Premium package monthly subscription is not working !!! hasn't for 3 weeks now . I've tryed everything to get it to work. it's very upsetting because it's the only music app on my phone plus I really need it for my gym workouts. everyone knows the key to a great exercise is your favorite music playing. please fix !
4749,Pandora,Angela Soper,5,685,"I have always loved Pandora. I would like to see a feature that rejects all live music, however. I'm not a fan and I get that often. I have the premium for a year for free since I'm a TMOBILE customer (SCORE!!!) and I do not have any of the problems others are describing. I love ad free and will renew once my free year from TMobile is up."
4750,Pandora,Amy Harley Mattson,5,69,"Still better than radio. I live in a remote area of Alaska that does not have many decent radio stations. I use the free version, so I understand that there's going to be ads. There are far less ads than on the local radio stations. When I'm in a 'dead zone' for cell signal then obviously it doesn't work (Duh..). I don't have problems with the variety of songs. The app never crashes. Maybe I'm lucky or perhaps complaints from others are user or cell service errors????"
4751,Pandora,Katie Lady,5,22,"I use the Pandora music app all the time. When I'm alone I can play anything I like. I like jazz, contemporary, classical, classic 80s, rock, so many types. When I'm at work, I can play the children's stations. It's really handy and I find it great to help me Focus my mood in the direction I want it to go. Sometimes before work I need a pick-me-up. Sometimes at work I need something to soothe small children. Thank you Pandora!"
4752,Pandora,Destinie Wilson,1,22,"Fix the skipping issue and better variety for 5 stars. Ever since the recent update, I have constant skipping. it's not every song but happens a lot. When you're connected to a system, that skip in music sucks. I pay to skip songs but the songs I do want to hear, I dont want skipping. Also, if I chose to skip a song, I dont want it popping up again in 5 more songs. Need a larger variety! I'd love to see a shuffle option! I like to listen to a little bit of everything and cant just shuffle!"
4753,Pandora,LeAnn Hatch,4,38,"pandora used to be the best but now, when you pause your song, the app completely closes and you have to start it back up, which starts a new song. usually the reason for pausing it is so i dont miss the song i was listening to. used to you could pause it, go to your home screen, make phone calls, whatever and open it back up and just hit play and it would start right where you paused it. only time it closed is if you went to your recent apps and closed it out. please fix this bug for 5 stars."
4754,Pandora,A Google user,4,33,"Everything about this app is fine just plrase make it offline. I jave to walk over 2 miles every day and would like to listen to music but my favorite music app, Pandora, takes WIFI and I dont have unlimited data so please make this offline. Other then that the app is perfect for music lovers, if you make it offline I will give five starsðŸ˜‰"
4755,Pandora,Dan Wilson,4,537,"So far i am loving the NEW pandora. I didn't give it 5 stars since i just began using the app. I see a lot of promise for the new version. Im a huge metalhead and the selection of categories is awesome ! I love variety. The sound quality is on point. So far no issues to report but, when i skip a song the load time is kind of lengthy. Besides that i am happy to see pandora make positive changes. Look out spotify !"
4756,Pandora,David Kowis,1,120,"Current version as of 11 March 2019 keeps a persistent notification that will not go away. I have to force stop it every time. Have tried clearing data, uninstalling and reinstalling. Disappointing. also, it got stuck in offline mode and wouldn't come out of it. the app is very disappointing. only Pandora's music discovery redeems this."
4757,Pandora,Elizabeth Cluff,2,25,"""Describe my experience."" Frustrating. There was a time when Pandora was a great free app. Now, Pandora is more concerned with having you buy the app. I don't mind the ads, but I do when the ads stop Pandora from working. Every time an ads comes up, Pandora freezes. I then have to close the app and open it back up again to listen to my stations. Another issue is the difficulty in choosing stations I want on my Shuffle list. Pandora plays stations not marked as if I hadn't made any choices."
4758,Pandora,A Google user,5,81,"I have enjoyed the listening pleasures of your Music. I have found it to be in qualitative and quantitive taste. To take the time to put this library of music together. I really enjoy all selections, thank you very very much. It is Superb, there is no comparison!! Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to express my satisfaction of your programmings."
4759,Pandora,A Google user,1,35,"I got a free trial subscription of Pandora Premium and it worked great, up until the end. Before even offering me a chance to buy a subscription it deleted all my collected songs and personal playlist, and i decided to buy it for 9.99 a month. I bought it, and now it doesn't work. it let me collect four songs but if i try to collect anymore it doesnt show up no matter how many times i try and i cannot download any songs for offline listening. It was a complete waist of money and time."
4760,Pandora,Mar G,1,131,"maybe it's coincidence, maybe it's podcasts, but suddenly nothing plays using wifi... well, not ""nothing"" the ADS ARE STILL PLAYING BUT EVERYTHING ELSE IS BUFFERING, SKIPPING TO NEXT SONG, BUFFERING, SKIPPING, BUFFERING etc ad nauseum. so if you don't want to use up all your data but still want to listen to music, i recommend google play, spotify, the radio, pretty much any. other. playform. if this gets fixed i'll be back to update. edit: i contacted support.... the problem is NOT fixed 4/5/19"
4761,Pandora,Sincerely Ro,1,4,"I use this app often, but lately I can't close the app. What happened to the ""X"" in the upper right hand corner? I have to disable the app just to close it. Can you please fix this problem so I continue enjoying the Pandora application."
4762,Pandora,A Google user,3,1,I really love this app but when I try to play it it will say buffering and go to the next song it won't let me lesson to any song
4763,Pandora,Mario Alvarez,3,34,"Apperently deleting your app data solves some issues. But the app still has some problems. If you are listening to downloaded songs while Not in offline mode and you loose internet connection, when a song finishes it will take seconds and even minutes for the next one to play. Another thing that bothers me a lot is that there is no way to download all the songs you have added to your music. You have to select each one and download them individually. There are other minor things that could improv"
4764,Pandora,Jello Wildey,1,37,This app sucks. They lure you in with an hour of uninterrupted music but you spend most of that hour pissing with the phone because it plays one song and skips four others before you even hear anything after the initial song was played. Or it plays one song and that's it. I then have to shut the app down entirely and restart. Is there anything that can be done about this on my side of the app or is this an IT problem to solve? Please help because I hate IHeart raido The app still sucks dick!!!!
4765,Pandora,Lamont Shavers,1,25,I have used Pandora for YEARS and have been satisfied until now. I'm a US Army soldier and i recently got stationed in Korea. My Pandora now says its unavailable in this country and I get the error code 3007 and there's no fix. How is it not available in South Korea and why should it matter? ESPECIALLY for offline listening? I'm very disappointed.
4766,Pandora,Noah Harmon,1,13,"You can start playing an albulm from one artist and never even hear a song from that artisit for hours at a time. You can be listening to country music and a ad comes on with a rap theme. If you leave your phone unatended to enjoy the music then it shuts off after a little while. Even the radio is better than this app! I will just step back over to spotify, which has better ratings anyway."
4767,Pandora,Angel Lee,2,12,I have had pandora for a while. not going to lie I prefer listening to spotify. reasoning because when I chose something to listen to let's say phantom of the opera. It doesn't even play music from said topic I pick. I don't even get music in the same genre. It every topic. I will try and play Korean music and I get American pop. It is frustrating. At least with spotify when I pick a station it actually plays the music I chose.
4768,Pandora,Dawn Graham,1,767,"it boots me out of the app every 4th or 5th song then when i sign back in it skips to next song. guess it's better than spotify which boots me out every 3 songs then repeats the song before playing 2 more then quitting. my playlists don't show up in my collection and i seem to have to go a round about way to get to them. i don't care about the ads, i just wish i could find a music app that plays what i like and i don't have to restart every 20 minutes. ps. your help site wasn't any help."
4769,Pandora,Ang Bishop,5,42,was Amazing... got frustrated because it kept crashing on me... Pandora helped me!!!! Thank You to the one who sent me the link. thank you as i don't have anything but my phone to access my account within Pandora.. which kept crashing. This appears to have resolved the issue. Running into another issue... don't know how to resolve it freezing and it just stupid playing... H.E.L.P. PLEASE
4770,Pandora,ARCHAngel ENLISTED,2,40,App won't stay open. This has been my favorite platform for music until I recently downloaded the update and now the app shuts down soon as it's turned on. Uninstalled and installed about three times and it does the same thing. Really discouraging because I pay for the premium and I can't even listen to my songs. Don't want to cancel my subscription but this isn't cool at all.
4771,Pandora,Charles Yancey,2,39,"The only reason I did not give this app a one star is because when it actually works I enjoy it. Currently I am paying for a subscription that I am unable to use because every time I open the app there is a connection issue. I have deleted and reinstalled the app multiple times and it still has connection issues. I am very unhappy because I use the offline mode to get through my 12 hour workday, but I am unable to use it because the app has connection issues."
4772,Pandora,Kerrie Blunck,1,1,"I've never had so much trouble trying to get help with starting a completely new pandora account . I needed to start over with a new email and its it's telling me my email is invalid even when asked what's the best email to reach you at. when you call the number provided there is no rep to actually talk to , therefore I'm at a standstill. I really enjoyed pandora until I couldn't get access help."
4773,Pandora,98 Savage,1,6,I have had Pandora for YEARS I have never had a problem but for about 2 weeks not I can NOT listen to a full song. I'm happy I didn't pay for commercial free because I'd be pissed even more right now! I don't listen to anything BUT Pandora so now what. if I have to I will download iheartradio and uninstall Pandora. I do see from reading all the other complaints that I am not the only one dealing with this. PLEASE FIX THE ISSUE!
4774,Pandora,Crystal Archey,1,95,I enjoyed all the stations. But im having a very hard time canceling my subscription. Tells me to go to the app store.. Then it says i tunes and then apple music. I have tried all of them for 4 months now to cancel and it wont let me. Couldn't even get a phone number to call because they said i could use one of the apps!
4775,Pandora,A Google user,3,1,Would give it 5 stars instead of 4 but even with a subscription I can only listen on one device at a time. Changed to 3 stars because it constantly freezes. It might be time for a new service.
4776,Pandora,Luke Moser,4,46,"Love this service I use it for all my music, I've collected an easy 400+ songs and I am still collecting more. I have a hard time navigating though them all though, if there was a way to sort my collection or like add 'tags' to songs so say I want to listen to up beat songs I could filter my collection for songs I've 'tagged' #Bumpin will come up and I can shuffle them. I think this would be neat because I listen to range of music and dont like it when a slow song cuts into my vibe."
4777,Pandora,A Google user,4,107,"i love it except i dont give it a five star for one reason, and that is whenever im done listening to it from my phone ""x""ing out only stops the music from playing but the app continues to run so i have to reboot my phone each time im done to clear it off so it doesnt suck on the battery. i have an LG Expression Plus, android (i love my phone and have never had any problems with it.) Any suggestions, Pandora?"
4778,Pandora,mycathaspurpleeyes123,3,1,"For some reason, whenever I try to open Pandora it doesn't work and says I have not installed the app even though I have, obviously. I don't know if that's a my phone thing or a Pandora thing."
4779,Pandora,Mary Guiseppe,4,48,"This app is great I have used Pandora for years. I decided it was worth the upgrade since I search for specific songs so much. As of recently, I find myself wanting to pay for multiple months as a time so I dont have to wait for the automatic withdrawal every month. I know it's not something that's offered right now (because I searched very thoroughly for it) but I think it would be a nice touch to add that as an option. I would certainly use it and I'm sure other people would too."
4780,Pandora,A Google user,3,68,Pandora is good but after 250 stations it won't let me add any more and the music is very limited. I won't to hear more songs from every artist and I want more artist and genres. Being limited is my only complaint. I use spotify for everything I cant get on pandora. maybe if I upgrade it would be better but there is too many free options.
4781,Pandora,Sarah Peters,1,196,"My experience with Pandora hass been just simply awful .. It's getting to the point to where the app keeps stopping when I try and play my favorite music .. I've tried most everything I can think of to resolve the issue .. But yet nothing works .. I've even tried updating the app .. It didn't work .. So on top of having to be bothered with ads befire I lisren to my favorite music , I also have to be bothered with the app stopping everytime I try and listen to music .. Every disappointed .. ðŸ˜”"
4782,Pandora,Russell Goldberg,1,333,I dont know what's been going on but pandora has been sucking lately. I have a brand new phone and always have service but pandora takes forever to load. it wont come off my screen and what ever station I make or choose hardly ever plays the person its named after. for instance I made a Neil Diamond station i hear more Karen Carpenter and Elvis then i do Neil
4783,Pandora,Jay C,1,17,What is going on with Pandora lately!!?? No matter where I am 80% of my songs are buffering and skipping nearly every song in my playlist! Also many songs I have previously downloaded now say they have licensing issues and are blacked out! I'm paying for unlimited for this? Please fix ASAP or I will be forced to cancel! I will not pay another month for service this bad believe that! What replicable business doesn't have phone support for technical services? Email only??? Wth???
4784,Pandora,M C,3,1,HATE HOW YOU CANNOT EXIT THIS APP! IT forces you to keep it open allll the tome unless u force stop thru settings...SO ANNOYING!
4785,Pandora,Ninja Penquin,1,1,plays for like 3 minutes then the app just shuts down without warning... update... uninstalled reinstalled still didn't work keeps shutting down on its own. officially done with pandora. going to Google play. update: contacted the website they asked me to and still not fixed... go figure
4786,Pandora,Dock Davis,1,1,I love how the first 5 star review was responded to by Pandora and they clearly didn't read the comment. This is clear by the way you told them to do exactly what they had already done. No matter what the app is like I am giving you 1 star. Try harder and I might give you 2 stars. Nice way to showcase your customer service skills Pandora.
4787,Pandora,thorman311,4,24,Good Selection of Music for the most-part on the Stations I've created. Would be a great improvement if the Controller-Interface were redesigned to include some more options including quick access to other Stations and access to the App Settings. Easy Controls such as Play/Pause/Skip/FF/and even a REW or Back option along with a Settings option for Music Quality and Play-Back Options. Overall though a good Music Program with vast reserves of Music from most of the best Genres. Streams Well mostly

4793,Pandora,Lauren Berry,5,832,"Coming back to Pandora. I pay for Spotify and have for years now. I love it however... there is just something lacking with their ""station"" capability that Pandora has figured out very well. I missed Pandoras ability to choose a fav song and curate the perfect station from it. I love learning new music I'm missing. it feels like spotify plays all the same songs I already have on my playlists. looking forward to rejoining Pandora"
4794,Pandora,Jonie Castro,5,1504,"I am a loyal Pandora fan! Been using it for almost 10 years. Although, I think it could do w/o the limited skips. If I'm not feeling a song, I should be able to keep switching ðŸ¤·â€â™€ï¸ but that's just me. Anyway, I love it. Great app!"

I am completely fed up and unhappy at this point."

4800,Pandora,Raymond Santiago,1,1138,you need to fix your app. since people like me pay for it. we dont really want are music cutting off every time we listen to our music. it funny how it happens on every song. I have to repen the app half way.through the song to hear the rest of it because it stop and thats in all modes and with both wifi and data so fix it or i want my money back or i go to the better business bureau
4801,Pandora,Steve S,2,56,constantly shuts off Alarm has a mind of its own. On the off occasion the alarm works it wakes you starteled as your'e not expecting it to come on. The advise Pandora gives to leave it running in the background doesnt work. Actually nothing works tried everything. plain and simple the alarm feature sucks. Use it for music and nothing else.
4802,Pandora,L Dub,5,170,I've always loved pandora... I'm a paid subscriber with Spotify as well and as much as I love that app... Another reviewer put it perfectly.... Something about pandoras stations song selection is just better. I found Spotify to play the same songs over and over after a while.

4803,Pandora,Bo jangles,5,37,"I'm updating my review, pandora has helped me figure out what the problem was with my app not working. somehow, someone hacked my account and was using my account. they had patience with my frustration and were willing to do anything to make me happy again. thank you pandora. I like you even more now"
4804,Pandora,Joshua Dow,1,303,"great app but the new update will not stay open, crashes after 3-5 seconds. Have been using premium for about 2 years now. alblums that I use to have fully downloaded now only half the songs will download for listening without the network. I should not have to delete the app and reload just to make it work after an update is released."
4805,Pandora,Sean M. Graves Sr.,1,1,"CONSTANT APP CRASH!!! I use Pandora as my primary streaming media source, above ALL others...which may now change! I pay WAY too much for this service to have your fix be, ""clear all data"" to rectify crashing or FAILURE to provide a paid service. I am disgusted and dismayed; if the past 2 weeks service is indicative of what is included in my paid subscription, I will be moving on!"
4806,Pandora,Reuben Kraxberger,4,20,"Fixed the issue with closing out my songs when I leave the app even for a moment. Works great! Just has annoying, repetitive ads, but I will likely pay for ad free soon since the other issues are fixed. Very good curation, but maybe needs a way to give reasons for dislike, such as song is live, or doesn't fit this station. otherwise love it"
4807,Pandora,A Google user,2,7,This has a great selection and I would give it 5 stars if would stay on. Worked great for a while it just stops playing and I have to hit the play arrow quit frequently sometimes two or three time during one song. I end up shutting it off. There is no way I'd pay for this app. can't depend on it to play.
4808,Pandora,Kayla Barker,1,210,"loved this app upon first downloading, it has updated twice in the last few weeks and the app now sucks! this is ridiculous, I can't even get through a song without it stopping and having to open the app back up to start the music again."
4809,Pandora,Megan Hall,2,17,For some reason the pull down playlist option is no longer available and instead it just informs me that Pandora is using a lot of battery and the notification cannot be removed untill its closed. This is a problem and inconvenience as i cannot pause a song or skip one without physically having the app fully opened. I don't know if this is just my phone or not but any help would be great. For now ill keep this on 2 stars since it defeats half the purpose of the app that way.
4810,Pandora,Marissa Haley,2,52,When I first downloaded the app it was working fine. Just recently did it start shutting off by itself and it gets annoying especially when a song you really like is on and it shuts off mid song. It's very frustrating and I'm about to delete it.
4811,Pandora,Miss Lady,4,1,Wonderful....except the update wont allow me to see what ive recently played. Meaning songs i have been listening to repeatedly are now gone. Cant remember alot of songs so that feature was very useful. Hope they fix it.
4812,Pandora,Kaz McKenzie,1,0,"I had to wait until payday to renew my subscription, as the money wasn't there before that. When I tried to use my only card to pay for my subscription, Pandora refused to run it again. Since I can't keep my offline music without a subscrption that valid payment was refused for, I will take my business somewhere else."
4813,Pandora,A Google user,1,297,"I never had a problem signing up for Pandora but now I have to sign in when I want to listen to my music. Every time I try it doesn't recognize my password and when I try to reset it I get a message that instructions were sent to my email account but there's nothing there, not even in my spam account. This is so frustrating ðŸ˜ "
4814,Pandora,Jason Beesley,2,102,"I used to love pandora, however now with the new updates it is no longer compatible with the pandora app which is loaded on my car. I always listen to it in my car. But since the app doesn't work any more I would definitely not subscribe monthly to a service which no longer works properly."
4815,Pandora,Nathan Culwell,3,15,"it works ok for the most part, let's me play music whenever, I can download it and listen to it on the go so not too bad. I'd give it 4 or 5 stars if it works all the time; I wouldn't say often but its enough to start getting a little annoyed when the ads freeze up and takes more time from me listening to music... and recently, it hasn't been playing my music... I mean that as in like none of my favorite songs and the stations that I have (downloaded and not)... so, hopefully y'all fix it soon"
4816,Pandora,Deep Ghetto,1,0,Constantly crashes! The app constantly crashes as soon as an ad loads. Coincidentally (?) this started happening after I ended my free trial of their paid version. It has played continuously maybe 3 times since then. Uninstalled!
4817,Pandora,Rhonda Perkins,5,2,the best music app so far. I listen to Pandora almost everyday. I also enjoy listening to it in my car. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE. â™¥ï¸ðŸŽ¼
4818,Pandora,Rob Nicholson,2,0,not great. plays the same handfull of songs over and over. needs to improve if they want me to pay for premium.
4819,Pandora,Chris Provencio,2,3,"while it is free and I do not have much to complain about. the only negative thing i have to say is that when I close the app, it does not fully close and drains my battery on my Samsung device. i have to manually goto my settings and force stop to fully close. please correct this action."
4820,Pandora,A Google user,2,78,"I've had the Best Musical & Podcast Experience, using Pandora. The Unlimited Music, is just as Good as, listening to some helpful and useful ads, then music. However, Why in the Name of Sam Hain, does it Quit or say Error we've unexpectedly encountered a problem with your account? code 3005. what is that all about?"
4821,Pandora,Randall Diehl,1,375,"never had a problem but now (last 2 weeks) it only works when it wants to. continues to say 'network is not available. try again?' when I say yes, nothing happens. had on offline mode and I cannot listen to anything which made my 4 hour flight even longer."
4822,Pandora,Nathan Millwood,3,0,worked fine for a few years then just recently it will just shut down. I pay for this service and would like to keep paying if the problem is fixed.
4823,Pandora,Melissa Douglas,2,47,"problems!, it starts to play but cuts off after a few seconds, why!?"
4824,Pandora,Gacha TV videos,4,0,Nice but I hate the fact that you have to watch and ad before listening and have to rrestart the ad if you turn off your phone while the ad is going to have to rewatch it
4825,Pandora,Cassian Tomaszewski,2,28,"I used Pandora for 3 years as my go to app for music streaming. Recently I bought a Galaxy S9+ redownload Pandora, lasted for 3 months until the app continuously closed when opening the app. Lost all my downloaded music, while redownloading all music the same issue occurred. Not sure if this is an issue with the app itself or my phone. I'll happily redownload Pandora once the issue is resolved."
4826,Pandora,Craig Borgstede,1,16,"Pandora is garbage on Samsung. If you thumbs down something, then the entire station will be unavailable for hours or the songs will be less and less than what you are looking for. Pandora's ""Adaptable"" experience is in dire need of being updated. I have music from a completely different genres on my stations. Very poor app at best..."
4827,Pandora,Kathy Rangel,4,23,"Love Pandora, have for many many years. Issue I am having is once I try and close the app it will start playing music again like a minute or 2 later. I have to literally restart my phone everytime I'm done using it so it doesnt open back up."
4828,Pandora,John Ansay,5,0,yes I enjoy pandora very. much. it is crystal. clear. and great music from the few left. that can sing. john A.
4829,Pandora,Zachary Augi,2,38,"Chromecast support just gets worse and worse. Different phone, different Chromecast, different network, same issues. Plays two songs then disconnects and becomes unusable with the ""Concurrent Streaming"" error popping up every 30 seconds. Canceled my membership I've had for 5+ years and switched to Spotify."
4830,Pandora,A Google user,5,1622,"This app is great for listening to music. You can dislike or like songs so your in control of what songs they play. I use this app for cleaning or just relaxing. Best music app ,one thing I would change would be being able to make a playlist and listen to it when offline."
4831,Pandora,A Google user,3,16,"Pandora's fine, I only have two complaints. 1: I've noticed that the longer I'm with them, the more ads I get--today, I had ads between every song, three songs in a row. 2: while it's supposed to choose music I'd like, the technology is pretty old and it mainly just recycles the same ten songs or so. Not as impressive as I'd hoped."
4832,Pandora,Jacob Fine,1,0,in your email you advertise playing Billy Joel and Piano Man..when i clicked on Pandora and opened your email there was nowhere that you had Billy Joel..but what you had was an icon to download Pandora..which i did..and when finished you still didnt have Billy Joel but only more icons to click on to download and charge fees..now i am going to uninstall you and block you..youre a scam and we both know it
4833,Pandora,david j,1,84,"since about nov 2018, the pandora music notification wont go away. clicking the close box does nothing. it is not convievable that they could leave this bug unfixed for so long. so i have to assume this is intentional. it has forced me to turn off pandora music notifications, which is really annoying when Pandora IS actually playing. use any other music service.. amzn, google play, spotify, rhapsody, anyone but pandora"
4834,Pandora,Bob Stone,5,68,"I had a problem, on my S7, quitting the app. Chris, from the staff, got right back to me and informed me to just hit pause and back out of the app. Not used to such quick, concise response. And to top it off, good ole, plain English! Great!!"
4835,Pandora,Ashley Jones,1,30,"What is with this update??? I have one of the paid versions and now I get errors galore, I can't close the app at ALL, and it randomly skips songs. Please either revert this update or get the bugs worked out ASAP!! (I will gladly change my rating back after the fix is in place)"
4836,Pandora,A Google user,1,70,"Great app...if you enjoy listening to 2 minutes of a song before the app crashes. The excessive amount of ads seem to play with no problems though. I used to love using Pandora, but now I'm forced to uninstall it. It's become a complete waste of space on my phone."
4837,Pandora,Mary Bringetto,3,22,"I like Pandora for music selection, but the fact I can never close it (x out of it) or get rid of it the notification settings list drives me crazy. I've restarted my phone (Galaxy Note 9)numerous times, removed and re-added, and the only thing that works is if I force stop. Done with the hassle!"
4838,Pandora,A Google user,1,17,Music will randomly just stop in the middle of a song and the app will crash. Happens almost everytime I use the app. I cancelled my premium and went to spotify because of this continuous problem. There are many other services that provide a similar type of product to pandora. I recommend using them before using pandora.
4839,Pandora,Kakuri Omari,2,13,"Love Pandora but getting tired. Went through the App always coming up in the car, then could not close the App using the X on the notification (which seemed to have been fixed but now is back again). Lately, casting to a group of chromecast speakers is broken and have spent weeks trying to fix. Minute or less into a song music starts to skip and cut out of the speakers, then just stops. I've noticed the Google icon indicating a cast session no longer appear when casting from Pandora. Please fix!"
4840,Pandora,David Parks,1,1,with the new update you cannot remove it from the banner by just pressing clear all. edit. coincidentally after my review: now my app vibrates my phone every time a song ends then vibrates again when the new song/ad starts. now 1 star
4841,Pandora,Karlie Thompson,1,1,after the last update i cant open my app unless i go through my app store... and i cant edit my playlists??
4842,Pandora,Marley Juarez,2,0,It's very inconvenient that lets say you put Arianna Grande radio it will put some songs of Arianna and then it starts to change because it randomly puts Rihanna I suggest Pandora should fix that so they can have more supporters than haters
4843,Pandora,Heather Dunphy,1,219,"Since the update will not stay open! I pay for premium and expect to be able to use the app as it's intended, but for a few days now I can't listen to Pandora. I am not happy at all! If I put it in offline mode it works but I don't have all the songs I want to listen to download. PLEASE FIX THE PROBLEM!"
4844,Pandora,Emily Shedd,1,30,"I used to adore Pandora but now it's slow and there are too many ads because they want you to buy the full version. I've had the paid version and realized it was just a waste of money. Also, the app itself doesn't want to take action after selecting a command. I've uninstalled and reinstalled until I'm just not going to do it anymore."
4845,Pandora,Margaret Armijo,4,4,Enjoy listening to my selections.. Would like to hear different songs played though. They are a lot of repeats.
4846,Pandora,A Google user,3,51,i have a couple thousand songs in my playlist. you pandora will only load the first 1000 and thats it. if i cant listen to a playlist thats a few thousand songs long. then i will just unsubscribe. i shouldnt have to make 6-8 playlist and have to flip flop from one to another all day. ridiculous
4847,Pandora,B Bray,3,14,I'm not sue if it's Pandora or Team Mobile but since the update to android 9.0 Pandora cuts off frequently for no reason when listening on a bluetooth device. It's the most annoying thing I've experienced in the last 3 or 4 years on a smart phone... It cut off 14 times during one song in while I was in the middle of a work out. Talk about frustration!
4848,Pandora,happy days,4,42,I love this app if u want a music app that when u go on something els and the music stays playing this app dose that. The only thing i dont like is that when u search a song theres a playlist not the song and i cant just spacificaly get to that song. I will rate it a five out of five if i can chouse the song i want to play. But i like that when your device turns of the music still plays.
4849,Pandora,Krystal Vale,3,17,"There are way too many ads. I should be able to skip as many times as I would like if I do not like a song. If this App does not get fixed to have a shortcut for my home page of my phone. I may just have to delete this app all together. I love the app, but the new updates make it impossible to enjoy the music I listen to. please fix it. Thank you!"
4850,Pandora,andy sayles,2,0,"I love this app, personally I think it's better than spotify but it keeps crashing. it crashes and then it wont play music. wish I could listen to it more but it can only play through half a song."
4851,Pandora,Sky High,5,0,"Great App, you want to feel alive? well this is the one App that will change your emotions stress free."
4852,Pandora,Paul Tucker,2,158,"Starting last night it's bern crashing seconds after opening I tried clearing everything, reinstalling the app, I even did a factory reset on my phone and unrestricted the apps drain on my battery per the support page's instructions. Still crashing or endlessly buffering while it skips song after song. Please get it fixed guys, otherwise I'm going to have to switch to Spotify."
4853,Pandora,Andrew Greenhalgh,5,62,great music app but i got the Pandora plus membership and want to cancel but Pandora is saying go though google play and google play says i dont have any subscriptions its not expensive but just dont want to pay for what i dont use anymore *UPDATE* after emailing the costomer service email given they cancelled my subscription no problem took probably less than 12 hours from first email to finalization. great service with great costomer service
4854,Pandora,Dave Laux,2,1,"It sucks that mobile phone apps and the computer can't sync up. Stqtuons that I listened to yesterday on a computer say I listened them over a month ago on my phone. Man, 2005 really sucks."
4855,Pandora,shar bare,3,16,"After the recent update it won't open through my app. It also plays random music/artists in my thumbs up station. Also after the update Alexa has some random station & nothing I had previously saved in my account. I pay for Pandora & when i use my app through my tv it only allows so many skips. it also only has a few of my stations, It should be universal no matter what you stream through & it's not! You can only access your account on a computer! ðŸ˜ !!!"
4856,Pandora,Rodney Wallace,4,32,"It works great when streaming using my phone. However, there is a bug when using Android Auto where Pandora sporadically starts playing automatically when I don't launch it. Also, when I thumb down or skip a song, it freezes and won't play music unless I change the station."
4857,Pandora,Bryce Kennedy,1,80,"App worked great on my Note 9 from Oct 2018 until Feb 2019 update. Now it crashes within 30 seconds every time it starts. It then keeps sucking power in the background until forced to stop. Have until installed & reinstalled several times, but problem persists. Will cancel my premium service if not fixed soon"
4858,Pandora,Kristy Morgan,5,0,"I love this app, you know why? Cause you can search up any song you like, or any singer you like."
4859,Pandora,Rachel Anschuetz,5,2,"doesn't waste my time with crappy commercials constantly, but does occasionally spam me with commercials in other languages. One hour of tunes and 5 minutes of commercials? I can deal."
4860,Pandora,addicted2myfz8 fun,1,22,I used to love this app. But this has gotten worst for me now this year it crashes in under a min. I am glad i havent paid for this app. As i would be sure getting my money back but you need to fix this ASAP or you will lose alot more people who very unhappy with this app.
4861,Pandora,Nic Hulst,4,0,it is a very good app i enjoy it. but lately if i open another app pandora completely shuts down. so pandora if you are reading this can you please fix this
4862,Pandora,Lori Butler,1,0,I have not been able to use my Pandora fir over a week. When I open it after about 5 seconds I get an error saying Pandora has stopped. I have sent multiple feedback but the issue is still not fixed. I have also uninstalled and reinstalled the Pandora app but it did not help either. I am a premium user and pay money every month to use this. So far i have gone 1/2 the month unable to access it. You should give reimbursements when your customers go this long not being able to use a paid service
4863,Pandora,LexyLovesYew,1,11,"why do I waste my money on your premium? i go to browse, look up an artist, then your app only plays ONE song actually BY that artist. everything else is ""similar music"" um I looked up a specific artist for a reason I would expect to actually listen to what I looked up."
4864,Pandora,Sarah Lauture,1,6,"Evertime I play music from my Playlist after 2-3 Song it just turns off. Sometimes the app doesn't even work, I would have to restart my whole phone for it to work for 2 second then it just stop working again. But I live everything else please Fix/Help"
4865,Pandora,A Google user,4,17,"Love Pandora, but some stations can be repetitive with the same songs playing. I know their trying to advertise their membership to make money, but it gets really annoying when you have to constantly press ""not now""...especially if you're in a hurry. Other than that, its one of my favorite mysic apps because it has a wide range of options that seems endless but the newest artisit/albums wouldn't be on here."
4866,Pandora,"Debbie, C Evans",5,10,"i love this app, i download all my favorites with no problems. able to search and find all my favorites songs, even from back in the day. love it"
4867,Pandora,Heather Schmidt,3,0,So I was listening to David Allen Coe radio and all a sudden this guy comes on.. Larry Pierce OMG! I'm FAR from a prude but WTH!! I actually felt Violated.. I know I can block content but swear words and stuff is one thing this guy is like country porn or something.. So you have 0 standards.. I guess now I'm prepared for anything to play..
4868,Pandora,Robert Madsen,1,264,"Latest update breaks Pandora functions on Android Auto. App will start and play but will stop and say ""Loading"" on screen when you attempt to change channels or skip songs. Nothing will play until you reboot both phone and head unit. The issue is repeatable after every reboot."
4869,Pandora,benjimin a.,3,76,"You should be able to listen to music offline without paying for premium. It makes me angry that i cant listen cause ""Only Premium members can use this"". it's unfair for people who are off of wifi a lot and can't pay for anything."
4870,Pandora,Jessica Vowells,1,29,"since your last update, when I click on the icon it says app not available. It was working fine yesterday 3/27/19. I noticed several reviews stating that same issue. your latest update screwed everything up!"
4871,Pandora,Nyla !!!!,5,14,PANDORA! Best music app ever. It's recognize's your most played content so therefore when on auto play you can be assured to hear your favorite tunes and new great tunes. Always!!!!!! Also that's just one example of the many personalized information Pandora gives to convince your life.
4872,Pandora,Evelyn LeBron,1,38,I have used Pandora radio for many years but for the past few weeks or so i have started having issues in my car and using my phone. Its not opening or says its crashed and i cant get it to play in my car either. I hope you fix it quick.
4873,Pandora,David Scott,1,6,App will repeatedly re-open and interrupt other music/ video apps when I am trying to listen to them. There are other streaming apps and music discovery apps that offer more control and don't need to resort to hijacking your phone. Try those.
4874,Pandora,Lily,3,537,"""Pandora Not Available In This Country"" pop up is pestilent and incredibly annoying. After it appears it completely debilitates the app and I have to restart my phone for it to work again. I live in the US, how do I fix this?"
4875,Pandora,Pamela Barry,5,27,Pandora is awesome it plays all the gospel music and it's the only place I get my gospel music no matter how old or the newest are home. I see us it's available on Pandora I listen to it all day and all night and I also see it on video Pandora is the best thing going as far as me I prefer Pandora over any and everything that they have out for me for my music thank you so very much a very satisfied and pleased customer with Pandora I would recommend Pandora to any and everyone that I come across
4876,Pandora,A Google user,1,0,"Upgraded my phone from the original pixel to a pixel 3 about a month ago. I pay for premium so I can download and use offline listening. Since upgrading phones the app will only partially downloaded my library. No matter what I do ( ie removing content and re-downloading or uninstalling and reinstalling the app) it wont fully download an album, doesn't matter if I'm using wifi or LTE or if the app is kept open or running in the background. And now the app won't run at all most of the time."
4877,Pandora,Clara Huddleson,3,14,"I love having so much music at my fingertips however the biggest annoyance for me is that the music starts playing as soon as you open the app. So when I'm laying in bed and want my instrumental station playing as I go to sleep, I open the app and go deaf from my rock station that I had previously been playing for my workout. What I wish they would do is have the app open to your list of stations and allow you to choose the station before any music starts playing. Then I would give 5/5 stars."
4878,Pandora,Butta Luv,1,26,Terrible lately. the app had been working well up until the last week. now it only plays 30 or 40 seconds of a song and stops playing and you have to stop the app and go back in and play a whole different song.
4879,Pandora,Ashley Redditt,3,0,i don't understand why the music is skipping now like a bad CD...? please fix. otherwise great app.

4881,Pandora,axelderhund,1,17,"why does this app's ford sync connectivity break after every other update? this app is so unreliable, i never know if it will connect or not. not to mention the persistent notification on Android. i would have uninstalled long ago if tmobile hadnt given a year of free premium. that's the only reason why i haven't installed this app."
4882,Pandora,Leslie Jones,2,89,The app usually runs with no problems but after the last update it won't run. I keep getting an error message 3005. I have reinstalled the app and I'm still having issues. Please fix the issue or tell me how to fix it so I can get my music back

4887,Pandora,Scott R,3,10,Works well but no variety. What happened to playing songs with similar artists when you create a station? I hear the same twenty songs over and over. Rarely does a new song make the Playlist.. No I am not in offline mode.
4888,Pandora,Shelita Freeman,1,13,Pandora has always been my goto in regards to music....but latley whenever I use it...it will play one song and then totally shut off. I will goto my phone to see what is going on and the Pandora logo will be refreshing and a new song will start. Frustrating when trying to workout or do other things when phone is not in hand. Will be looking into other streaming services. Annoyed
4889,Pandora,Chris Bishop,3,0,Would be a solid 5. But since the new update. I have to force stop in my app manager to stop app.

4893,Pandora,jeff jeffy,1,40,"Horrible music collection, always plays the same songs, too expensive, too many ads. The ads also BLOW your eardrums out. Don't for thr love of all that is holy, ever use this app. Used to be 4 stars but slowly dropped to 1. Get Spotify"
4894,Pandora,Mariah B,1,18,"Won't fully download albums for offline listening, which is annoying considering I actually PAY for Pandora. Lyrics do not load half the time. Crashes a lot. Honestly thinking of switching to Spotify or Apple Music lol I hear they're more reliable. edit: now crashes every single time I attempt to run the app ðŸ™ƒ so it's virtually unusable. Will not be paying for Pandora Premium much longer. Also, the link provided by support below is a broken link, so that didn't help much lol"
4895,Pandora,Mark Craft,1,48,"Been a premium subscriber for quite a while, but cancelling soon. New update causes program to crash. sent NUMEROUS feedback after crash with NO RESPONSE. Am gonna try one of the others. Don't waste ur time and money on this like I did."
4896,Pandora,Colleen McCoy,4,1,"I like Pandora, and I don't mind the commercials, but the volume control is terrible. I feel like the ads are blasting through my headphones louder than a concert! I hope this is a bug that gets fixed, rather than a feature."
4897,Pandora,James McClain,2,0,"too many ads as of late, sometimes 2 per song, that is too much. 1 min of ads for a 4 min song."
4898,Pandora,Jonathan Weekes,1,0,"Was good, but recent updates are killing it literally. it force-closes all the time, or just hangs."
4899,Pandora,courtney trapp,1,79,Pandora's about to lose the number one spot as my music provider because they can't fix the app issue of shutting down I can't listen to any of my songs without pandora timing out saying apps not Working. I have uninstalled the app twice and reinstalled it. This has been doing this for over a week now
4900,Pandora,Desertfox 247,1,18,"Pandora, no I will not contact your help team. this is something that you all need to look into asap. I'm sure others are having the same issue. and please dont say that it's my phone cause I never had this problem till the last 2 updates. please fix now."
4901,Pandora,Mica Kluza,1,29,"great app at first, way too many ads now. however i understand you need to make money, but can you atleast make sure your app works. dam this app has gone to trash . the app wont even load properly. ive uninstalled and reinstalled, and re updated"
4902,Pandora,Sergio Magana,3,12,"Was better in the past. After pausing music, and the screen timing out, I have to unlock the phone and go back into the app to hit play again. Prior versions of the app kept the music controls on the lock screen, as per my settings, no longer the case. I use the app at work so have to pause fairly frequently."
4903,Pandora,Nick B,1,16,"Started playing itself randomly every minute or so after I played a few songs today. I stopped it again the first time, closed the notification the second time, closed the whole app the third time, and then uninstalled it the fourth. I can't have it start doing this at work."
4904,Pandora,Liberty Bumb,2,0,"i got the 10$ plan and it buffers more now than before i started paying, and not to mention there is no memory space for offline listening. so you basically have the same 15 songs for offline unless you delete em constantly and im not even gonna get into how annoying it to do that."
4905,Pandora,Edward Deerly,5,1,Great app! I've had no problems with it so far. I plug my phone into a pair of powered speakers and have music for my shop Or I just use my headphones on my walks.
4906,Pandora,Evin Herzberg,1,4,update: still havent beeb reached back from pandora! new update is so laggy it makes app unusable. have to restart app just to get it to stop playing. and still wont work. going to pdora.co/appreview will bring up a pandora error page... unacceptable
4907,Pandora,Lee Herron,2,44,TOO MANY DAMN BUGS WITH PREMIUM. YOU GUYS SHOULD HAVE HAD THEM CORRECTED BEFORE YOU LAUNCHED THIS SERVICE. FORTUNATELY IM ON A FREE TRIAL FOR PREMIUM. I WILL BE SWITCHING BACK TO MY OLD PLAN WHEN FREE TRIAL IS UP. MAY EVEN CANCEL ALL TOGETHER. FIX THE DAMN PREMIUM SERVICE. BOTH ON ROKU AND THE MOBILE APP.
4908,Pandora,Adrian Maldonado,2,1,"Updraded to Pandora premium, now i cant sort my stations alphabetically. I can sort by category but the list is sorted by most recently played station, makes it difficult to find a station that I want when the stations are always randomly sorted based upon what I listened to last"
4909,Pandora,Dawn Langmade,2,7,"I've been a paid subscriber for years; however, in the recent months I've been contemplating canceling. First, I've noticed periodic commercials now, it won't play a full song without disconnecting. Never had this problem before and if it's not fixed soon, I will be canceling."
4910,Pandora,austin hall,4,0,it's great but I use the premium and I can't edit my playlist in anyway I do something like try to move the song or delete it and when I press save nothing happens
4911,Pandora,Jennifer Jarman,2,0,"If I open another app, while I'm listening to my music. It stops playing after a few seconds. Is this something new?"
4912,Pandora,HR UndeadQueen,3,3,"I've had Pandora premium for over 6 months now. I'm thinking about getting rid of it solely because of the newest update. half the music I have on my thumbs up can't play because it can only be played in the actual station and then I can't skip some of the music which I then have to take the hard way around on the first page switching back and forth different stations all due to ""licensing "" well looks like spotify is going to gain another customer for its premium."
4913,Pandora,Larry San Miguel,1,29,"After phone (Android) update Pandora is just annoying, refuses to sync with stereo application, rendering itself essentially useless. Gave them a month to update and correct before submitting this review. Newest update is for podcasts? Are you kidding?"
4914,Pandora,kesha mcleod,1,7,"I have had to continuously force this app to stop running. When I close it, it just keeps running. Then I had to uninstall, then re-install it. I have used this app for years and never had as many issues with it as I do now. Come on guys....you gotta fix this ASAP!!!"
4915,Pandora,Ian Kirby,1,11,"Been using Pandora for years and I'm sick of it, it used to be the best but it's fallen behind all the competition. It always closes randomly, i try to swipe to dislike songs in the past and it instantly brings me to an ad, and the worst is that it plays the same goddamn 5 songs and nothing new. it's obvious which song licenses are cheaper for them to play by which songs come up."
4916,Pandora,Tia G,3,0,For some reason now the lyrics are nit accessible. It shows part if them and asks if i would like to see more but when i try to it doesn't. The link takes me to the album but no lyrics. Big fan of the lyrics. I understand not every song has the option. But when it is offered the link should work
4917,Pandora,Brandi McCracken,2,0,"everytime I try to use pandora, I have to restart my phone because it won't load, it just constant buffering. I have tried to force start the app and reopen, still the same problem. I even got a new phone and same issue. I pay for the premium and shouldn't have to do this everytime."
4918,Pandora,Annabelle Lecter,2,3,"I've had Pandora for just over ten years. It's understandable to get advertising between songs for an unpaid account, but I just heard an ad for Jimmy Dean sausages cut into the Stevie Wonder tune I was listening to, pestering me to""upgrade"". First time I've heard a song chopped for a commercial. It's time to move on."
4919,Pandora,Brenda B,5,1,i really like pandora radio station? it is so nice can listen to any type of music u prefer.
4920,Pandora,David W,1,1,"Major issues with new podcast feature. Pandora can't seem to remember where I left off. Also, no ability to report a problem. Just a giant, vague, useless help page. I will not be paying them any more."
4921,Pandora,A Google user,1,0,"Money stolen from me. Asked for a refund, had my sub cancelled and not one dollar in my account. I asked for a refund, not a subscription cancellation. Do not support thieves and and people who do not test their product before public release. Time to move on to the competitor...."
4922,Pandora,Don Clark,1,5,ERROR CODE 3005! Why do i pay for premium to get an error code constantly. I tried to fix it using your website help. Didnt work. This problem only showed up for me last week. You fixed your app until it broke. Did Bethesda buy you guys on the downlow? Get it together or I am gone.
4923,Pandora,Robert Thompson,5,34,When Pandora first came out I used it for 6 months and deleted because of different reasons. I redownloaded 2 years ago and hav'nt looked back. Thank you for letting me listen to the music I want to listen to.
4924,Pandora,JJ,5,16,"I've used Pandora plenty of times in the past and enjoyed the experience. It has everything the other music streaming platforms have, so it's great in my book! Pandora was the first music streaming service I ever used on smartphones. :)"
4925,Pandora,Willie Richards,1,2,"ever since I updated the app, it has been buffering like hell when I know i got internet service. PLEASE fix asap! because it's starting to piss me off when I'm paying for the premium package!!!"
4926,Pandora,Ashley Walling,3,0,I love the variety of my favorite songs but now after a couple minutes of playing the app just stops playing until I go back to it. Is this a update error? It used to play for hours.
4927,Pandora,Brett Steffen,3,0,I love this app. But only giving 3 stars at this time because it quit working with my Ford Sync in my 2010 F150. Can still use it over Bluetooth audio but unable to thumbs up and skip songs from my steering wheel.
4928,Pandora,Jonathan McClendon,5,3,"Please fix bug issues. App keeps closing after new software update Pi1.0. Thanks for the response. I deleted the cache and data, then uninstalled and reinstalled. Working good now."
4929,Pandora,Luke Fontano,4,0,very good but not perfect. some navigation is not intuitive. other issues are related to Pandora algorithms getting into a rut
4930,Pandora,Evelyn McCormack,2,0,Keeps saying that it is unavailable in the United states when I have used pandora on and off for the past 5 years fix this if not finding a new music app to try
4931,Pandora,Ellen Engroff Skoller,2,5,"I typically love Pandora and choose to use that as my sole app for playing music. I've had frequent issues where it spontaneously stops working at the end of a song and there's nothing I can do to get it to work again. I try restarting the phone, clearing my storage, disconnecting and reconnecting to wifi, nothing works. I thought it had to do with a weak connection because I mostly used it on public wifi. After buying premium, on private wifi, it's still not working. Wish I hadn't paid for it."
4932,Pandora,Cherice Brown,5,10,"This was my first experience here and it was great! Nan at the front desk was so polite, nice, attentive. and reassuring that this visit would be great. Cindy did my pedicure and she was fantastic! She was very detailed and just gave the best leg and foot massage. my toes are perfect. Nancy did my fill in and her work is fantastic! My. wild look like my nails and the polish is perfect. The ambiance is very nice, very relaxing and is very clean. I will be returning."
4933,Pandora,Donna Allison,5,776,I love this! I think this app is the best thing since sliced bread. There's so many songs that I haven't heard in years or a teenager and now I can listen to them anytime I want. It's just the BEST!!!!!!!!!!
4934,Pandora,Jasmine Smith,2,0,first of all my pandora was working just fine when i was on other apps. But then its cuts out and i cant listen to music like i used too. it could've been 5 stars if I didn't have to go back to the app and open up my nusic every time i back out of it.
4935,Pandora,Josh Sanford,3,15,I downloaded this onto my tablet about a week ago and this morning it stopped wanting to play my thumbs playlist properly. It skips over songs and when I flip my tablet to portrait instead of landscape the page that shows the song turns white with the exception of the album cover and the top left corner of the screen. I've had no issues before this whatsoever so if you can get this fixed I'd greatly appreciate it.
4936,Pandora,Israel Arce,5,14,great for free music only negative is the ads...but if you get not interruption version its worth it play your favorite song and download it too. plus you can replay your favorite song over and over.
4937,Pandora,A Google user,3,12,"Many artists, albums, and songs. Easy to use and it's awesome that you only have to watch one ad before you can listen to music without ad interruptions, plus you can listen while the screen is off or while using another app. The only downside is that the music stops when a game is open and that some liscenses have changed, making some songs only available on radio stations"
4938,Pandora,Von Eaglin,1,13,"I have loved using this app for years. I have many playlists saved. All of a sudden, this app won't work anymore and keeps buffering. Doesn't matter whether I'm on Wi-Fi or not. really sucks. lot of time and effort put into my playlists. I've reinstalled the app several times and it still does the same thing and even got worse. I'm stopping my membership"
4939,Pandora,Brian Watkins,2,10,"I loved Pandora and used it for years. Suddenly it was different, i use it while doing work on my PC and i find myself having to click ""still listening"" every 20 minutes or so. it just always takes me out of my groove and when you click yes... it starts an ad. I wish it just played the ad, then back to music. I had to switch to other music apps because of it."
4940,Pandora,dave Green,2,47,"After the newest Andriod update Pandora keeps shutting off. After several atempts of unistalling and reinstalling it still doesn't work. Issue needsbto be fixed or I will have no option, but to end my subsciption. Not paying for something I can't use."
4941,Pandora,Frederick McKenzie,1,1786,"so I put it in offline mode before the last update now it won't open. can't do anything with the app even while paying for premium. please fix soon, it be nice to even open the app."
4942,Pandora,Phil Fox,1,9,They make you jump through hoops to cancel. They obviously hope to discourage and trick you into continuing your membership. Another 49 bucks charged to me for a service I will not use.
4943,Pandora,George Payne,1,20,it keeps freezing up and i wont let me download any offline stations. which i pay for the pandora plus subscription. would give it 5 stars but because of this only 1 star and going to cancel my subscription if it dosen't work soon.
4944,Pandora,Panneerselvam Ramarajan,1,11,"I am going to discontinue my premium subscription due to the app inabilities. When stopping music in Google home hub, it switches to phone and plays automatically, it's annoying. There is no option to select and play music in Amazon Echos (no cast button in the app for Amazon devices). Every time I open the app, it tries to play the music automatically, well its nice but give an option to not to do that, not everyone likes it."
4945,Pandora,TheOneAndOnly Brax,5,6,Great app! Lets you play music for free for up to a half an hour until you have to watch an ad. Also you can listen to radios of different artists that play music ad free.
4946,Pandora,jokerz4fun,3,0,The app has a few bugs. Like turning on randomly or popping up in the notification bar on your phone when when you close it. So you then have to go back in press play then pause and THEN it will allow you to close it. Good times
4947,Pandora,Sharon,1,0,Keeps shutting off. Going to start using Spotify. I have the Samsung s9 Â± this shouldn't be happening.
4948,Pandora,Chad Webber,3,0,"having issues with music only playing for a minute or so, then shutting down. What's the problem?"
4949,Pandora,David Burgess,3,2,"its great except a few things, when i thumb up, i play another genre of music and my thumbs ups play even if they arent that genre which i dont like, also during my subscription, im getting a lot of repeated songs constantly which is really annoying, otherwise great app."
4950,Pandora,A Google user,4,32,Compared to spotify and the rest I've had more success with this I love it lets cut back on the commercials I know commercials are important to u and u do have an out some of us we really can't afford it but you do have a great setup if you also use the bass and volume app. thanks again ðŸ˜Ž
4951,Pandora,BonnieDead Fazbear,3,137,I seriously do love this app. great Stations and stuff like that my only complaint is the ad usage I can't even turn up or down my volume without always ad and multiple times I got 2 to 3 ads in a row but thank god that one stopped and I know I can just get Pandora Premium but 9.99/month really. otherwise good app
4952,Pandora,Robert McEnery,5,0,"My Pandora app got stuck offline on my Galaxy Tab A Uninstall/ reinstall did not work, wipe cache partition did not work. While it is installed, go to settings, Apps, select Pandora, select Storage, CLEAR CACHE, back to the previous page, FORCE STOP, return to home screen and start Pandora. If problem still exists, go back to apps...storage and CLEAR DATA and CLEAR CACHE. Force stop then open Pandora. You will need to enter your account and password again."
4953,Pandora,Daniele Bimel,1,0,the app has started to close out every time I pause a song and I have to reopen the app to start playing music again.
4954,Pandora,Michael Ndoye,5,0,"for those of you that actually pay for premium, all you had to do was clock the song playing on the radio, watch a 15 second ad, and now you have 30 minutes of premium for free."
4955,Pandora,A Google user,1,14,"maybe if you stopped harrassing me to upgrade, id raise your rating. if it was worth it, i would have done it. stop advertising on your own app. commercials that i have to listen to anyway bc i use the free service is fine but not letting me use the app until i tell you i dont want to upgrade every time i use your app is just harrassment for no reason. i will never EVER upgrade like most of your users BECAUSE you harrass me every day to upgrade."
4956,Pandora,Kc Slade,3,20,"Pandora is making people upgrade to plus. They won't allow you to put the home screen up. I suggest uninstalling like I am going to, and switch to Spotify. Good try Pandora asta lavista... Was a 1 star now a 3 finally able to download:-)"
4957,Pandora,Bryce Zornes,2,0,"Currently Pandora even after I've closed it out and shut down All running programs on my phone Pandora will turn itself back on, play music and not show up as a running program. This is very annoying when I'm trying to sleep"
4958,Pandora,Shane Taggart,5,5,please tell me!!! i have thumbed down a few songs i have liked. i want them back. i accidently thumbed down a song i really like. how do i get to go back and change that. my phone slipped in my hand playing one of my most faveorite songs and i want it to come back
4959,Pandora,Brittany Flogaus,3,4,"I like the app, however, I tried to make a separate account from my husband and it keeps telling me I can't sign up. I tried a couple different emails and it still said I couldn't make an account."
4960,Pandora,Brianne Timosevic,1,9,"This app keeps shutting down when I open another app on my phone. Also shuts down on its own when Pandora is the only app active. I hear the same songs on rotation, very rarely is anything new played. I pay for premium and am getting to the point that I am going to be looking at other services. Fix these issues before you are down another customer."
4961,Pandora,Akilah Powell,1,1,whenever I'm playing music on Bluetooth (without headphones) the app stops about every 15 minutes
4962,Pandora,HARRY POTTER,4,3,I love this app because you can exit out from the app and still listen to the songs plus you can make a list of what songs you want to listen to after another sing the only thing that bothers me is the ads that pop up before you pick a song but overall I LOVE this app
4963,Pandora,Nate Jones,2,0,after updating the notification stays al the time. opening and closing the app again gets it to go away for about 5 mins and then it's back again. only way to keep it from returning is to go into the settings and force stop the app
4964,Pandora,Chelsee Hatfield,2,5,Having some kind of technical issue apparently! It suggested I clear all the data and of course I lost all of my playlists! After all that it still isnt working!!!! Might have to switch to something else.
4965,Pandora,Yvonne Luttrell,5,0,really like pandora there's not alot of ads maybe 1 or 2 every 30 minutes which is fine with me keep up the good work.
4966,Pandora,Harry Roberts,1,3,"I used to think Pandora was the best radio app in the world, but now it's not. Once you subscribe and pay , you can't get out. You use your phone or tablet to subscribe, but you can't use them to unsubscribe. You have to use your computer. If you logout, or stop your account. You are still paying them. I sign up them using my phone. They accept it then. but you can't use your phone unsubscribe."
4967,Pandora,A Google user,5,25,"Vary cool app. don't care too much for the music, and I use that word lightly... the new music of today. With this app I can listen to some real music, thank you Pandora."
4968,Pandora,Matthew Roddam,2,13,"Good app, love the thumbprint radio. However, with recent updates the ""X"" in the app notification no longer closes the app, making it very annoying to exit. It will also randomly pop up when nothing is playing, and is not dismissible die to the aforementioned X not working. 5 stars when fixed. Edit 2/19/19: Changing to 2 stars since this is still not fixed."
4969,Pandora,Richard Clark,1,11,"Due to licensing restrictions i am unable to give you anything more than 1 star for false advertising of Pandora Plus. You say ""Unlimited"" skips with exceptions, but thats not unlimited.. you might want to look it up in the dictionary.."
4970,Pandora,Jamie Allison,2,7,"I don't know if it's something to do with the latest update, but I can't listen to anything or do anything on the app without it closing. All I know is that I was listening to it last Thursday and it stopped playing and closed out. now it won't let me do anything without it closing as soon I get on the app. Please fix this. I would give 5 stars, but considering the issues I'm having, I'll give it 2 stars until everything is fixed."
4971,Pandora,Kelsey Graham,4,3,"I personally love Pandora. I feel as if its strength is personalized music. When I listen to a specific artist it plays similar music. I have found that other music apps don't do as well of a job as Pandora. I have one problem though, certain songs I cannot listen to unless its on radio mode. It's not that big of a deal, however if I wanted to listen to a specific song I would have to wait for it to come on onto the radio due to lisencing restrictions. An example of a genre effected is folk."
4972,Pandora,weirdeyedkid â„¢,2,23,"Too hard to reach My Music. Plays stations by itself when I open app. Forgets what I was listening to if I close the app for minutes. Sometimes the second that i pause a song, it goes away"
4973,Pandora,Aaron Banks,1,0,I need to unsubscribe because I don't have the money to renew but have to jump through so many loops to do it that its ridiculous
4974,Pandora,Darren Millam,1,1,app keeps crashing 30 seconds into a song on my GS9+ worked fine before update. Have to re open and it restarts.
4975,Pandora,Brittney Randolph,3,16,Love the app. My issue is that it keeps cutting off whenever i try to use different appa on my phone. Please fix this issu. I would hate to have to delete this app again
4976,Pandora,Sheena McRae,5,9,"I love Pandora! It is great but when I tap n it, there is a message that says""Application not installed"". I did install it. Why is it doing that?"
4977,Pandora,Rensia Zayas,5,10,"I am truly at a lost for the right words , because when you hear that song, and to be able to repeat the song. Your station is on a level of its own and I greatly appreciate and thank you for your service.ðŸ˜Š Truely happy"
4978,Pandora,A Google user,5,7,pandora I really like your not quite right in Madden and you know I usually say sometimes we both got to think about it a little bit it doesn't take very long that's right and so I just want us to be sure that we don't just look at one side of this and not look at both sides in other words it's not something to put on social media which we got so much of that dumb stuff going on today is a great tool for many good things but it also can be in many instances is becoming very dangerous a place to
4979,Pandora,Mary Caruso,4,0,I do love this app. But I have one big problem that is when Pandora changes my pickof what I am listening to.
4980,Pandora,Melanie Lamb,1,0,why is my music constantly stopping I. the middle of the song? then I have to stop go back to the app and press pkay. someone help
4981,Pandora,Donya Davis,3,2,I got up this morning and my Pandora widget was gone. I looked through my widget drawer and it wasn't there either. I love the app and I will fix my review when problem is fixed.
4982,Pandora,Shannon Rogers,3,1,this is an okay app. I have seen it offer to shuffle my playlist of collected music and then later cannot find how that got turned on. Plays a lot of the same tracks by the same artist.
4983,Pandora,Janice Young,5,3,"App did not show up on my screen.....great....ugggggggg, so it is uninstalled. Thank you very much, well, for nothing. Tried again, few weeks later.... no app on screen. I logged in, from the install page in playstore, no app. Do I need to do something different for my tab?"
4984,Pandora,Josiah Smith,1,13,"I absolutely love this app and use it all the time for workouts and other things. But for the past week and a half or so it has been failing. Id open the app, then 3 seconds or sometimes 10 minutes later it shuts down on its own. Ive tried restarting my phone and uninstalling the app and then reinstalling it again, but nothing has worked. Please fix this problem or I am going to switch to something else."
4985,Pandora,Dark Venom,1,15,Privacy concerns. I use pandora a lot but while listening I got a chill when pandora is telling me about what type of car I am driving and about a recall on it. I appreciate the heads up but had that fixed years ago. it's just off putting since I am using the aux cord and nothing more without the original radio or onstar connected
4986,Pandora,Danielle Slayton,1,0,"The app pauses all the time, for no reason at the most inconvenient times. Its a hassle always having to press play everytime i decide to walk away from my phone."
4987,Pandora,Chris Aldridge,2,14,"update: vety tired of app in notification bar. figured out it's thd ""Feed"" updating. Doesnt actually say what's new and cant be turned off!!!!!Prev: Wish song names were bigger. Cover art doesn't do me any good when I can see the small text while selecting in my car dock. Subscription modification is a pain...had to cancel. Support is backlogged. App keeps opening and getting stuck in my notification shade, can't close or swipe away. Wish they had a multi streaming option."
4988,Pandora,George Irvin,5,12,I have been locked out of Pandora. I have no idea eay. I thought I did an upgrade. You are not the only music app available. Please let me know what you and I can do.
4989,Pandora,Monika Scott,1,25,I dnt know what's going on. I've listen to pandora for years and now my music cut off in the middle of the song and I have to reopen the app to listen to it again yet another song starts and it does it again and again. Please fix
4990,Pandora,crystal martinez,5,24,"I also have been having problems with the app crashing lately but i wouldn't 1 star it for that just give them time to fix it, contact Pandora support dont bash the apps ratings its been amazing for years. it's a great app no other music app measures up."
4991,Pandora,Mark Bost,2,1,"Loved the ap EXCEPT I paid for ad-free subscriotion without losing the ads. I went to troubleshoot which took me on a scavenger hunt for solutions. No contact email or phone. When I finally found a ""paying for ad-free, but still getting ads"" blog, the answer was another goose chase for ME to look for the place where I took off the ads. I pushed the pay button so would take it off. pandora is NOT a customer oriented group. I'm gone."
4992,Pandora,Traise Cain,1,0,Keeps crashing. My favorite app to listen to but it's hard to listen to music whenever the app crashes.
4993,Pandora,Life Lessons,1,0,the songs keep skipping and they won't play. i uninstalled and restarted my phone. i really didnt wanna have to go to Spotify but i cant be without my music. fix this or i leave.
4994,Pandora,Adam J.,3,4,"I love Pandora. Been using it almost since it launched. But as a user I feel completely insulted by the constant, unavoidable pop-up ads in a service I PAY FOR. I have told Pandora probably 50-100 times that I do not want to upgrade. Yet they keep asking. For me at least, this severely degrades the quality and usability of the app. It also shows Pandora doesn't seem to respect even their paying customers. Maybe Spotify does? I prefer Pandora, but a decade of loyalty should matter."
4995,Pandora,Mark Yergin,2,0,"It's great if you pay for it. If you prefer to listen for free, then you'll be listening to ads after every 2 songs. I get that ads are thing now, but with how frequently you have to listen to them it's ridiculous."
4996,Pandora,Cynthia Garcia,2,6,Good but the constant upgrade and pay for no ads screen can ruin the experience. I am aware I can upgrade whenever I want. I rather listen to spotify because its not like this.
4997,Pandora,A Google user,3,29,I generally love it. For some reason the app cuts off if I dim my phone. All my settings are for it to run on the background. it started after the last update.
4998,Pandora,Jason Childers,3,3,"Using Pandora for years. Finally had to uninstall. Mainly used to listen to music while driving to and from work. The pop up ads are what made me abandon this app. I don't mind listening to ads for free music. Changing stations takes two taps, but the constant pop up ads make for a dangerous situation while driving as you have to close them to continue. Finally, after about 7 years of using Pandora, I have to say the algorithm for picking songs still leaves alot to be desired."
4999,Pandora,Pronimic- o,1,15,After years of using pandora it just started having an issue where the app freezes in the background and i have to get back on it so it restarts but then just freezes after a couple seconds again. is this something to do with my phone or a bug? how do i fix that.
5000,Pandora,Razjah Ashley,5,9,Pandora is a good app because you get to learn to your favorite songs or hang out with your friends and have a dance party or when you go to bed you can learn to music and hope fully it will help you sleep it does for me so that's why I give Pandora a 5 star rating
5001,Pandora,Jake Cline,1,1,this app sucks. some how it constantly gets stuck while playing a song as though it were a record with a scratch. Not sure how that's even possible with a digital song....
5002,Pandora,Amanda M. Gurecki,2,0,"Free version. Love it when it works, but when I'm on wifi, its constantly buffering between songs and skipping tons because it apparently can't load them. It's not a wifi issue, as it happens no matter what wifi I'm on."
5003,Pandora,Dawson Simmons,5,11,"Amazing app! Not only can you discover new songs with the radio function, but you can create you own Playlist without Pandora adding suggested songs forcing you to listen to them (like Spotify), this is the best music app I've ever used and I highly recommend it."
5004,Pandora,Anna CAraway,5,14,"Any kind of music you can think of, you can find it on Pandora. I love the many different stations to choose from. I love being able to personalize my music by thumbs up and down."
5005,Pandora,Victor Laboy,1,1,I enjoy pandora one of the best but with the last update been having problems listening to my music constant cutting of when a song is playing and from what I have read others are having the same problem. Please fix then will change from 1 star to 5
5006,Pandora,Chrisn Tam,2,2,"I've had this app for a while now. I pay $10 a month for a subscription. great app. but now, the app keeps closing 4 seconds after I open it. I've uninstalled, reinstalled and restarted my phone, still happening. why? oh and Korn Radio, shouldn't play Eminem. if I want eminem, I'll play eminem."
5007,Pandora,Cheyenne Liester,4,1,"I've always used pandora, but what I wanna know is why I got a notification that says update the app and get 3 months premium for free, so I click the link and it brings me here, where the app is already updated fully and I'm still scratching my head wondering where is my free trial?! Empty promises are what's wrong with the world."
5008,Pandora,Bradley Baker,5,1,"great selections.the ads are a drag but pays the apps bills,saleries.etc.just a great application!!!ðŸ˜ðŸŽ‰ðŸ’ðŸ“±ðŸ—½ðŸŒ…"
5009,Pandora,Tink Fritz,5,1,"This app is awesome! It learns what you like and focuses playlists based on your preferences, creates a playlist of songs you have thumbed up; just in case you want to hear your favorites only, or you can listen to random musuc as you wish. It even downloads your stations for offline listening. Add to this the ability to see lyrics and info on the band, unlimited skips and repeats and you cannot make a better investment, especially considering the low price! LOVE IT!"
5010,Pandora,A Google user,4,14,"I love my Pandora app... it is my go to for music... however, I wished it would put your ""thumbs up"" songs in a separate folder so you can listen to them whenever you'd like.. that would be great.."
5011,Pandora,Ryan Howell,1,2,"this app has turned into a joke have to go to the play store now to open it. fix this pandora, cant wait for your canned response."
5012,Pandora,Michelle Jones,1,14,I open it and half way thru the first song the app dies and I have to start over and it just keeps doing it. I've tried on wifi and on my data nothing changes it just keeps shutting off. Happened before the update and is still happening after the update.
5013,Pandora,Will Yancey,3,1,"Sometimes it sucks. The app get frozen, and they same over and over. It plays songs not related to the time or genre. I have unlimited skips, but it not unlimited"
5014,Pandora,Andre Adame,4,17,Making your custom play list with its own name is great. i like how i can repeat a song again by sometimes hearing a quick ad. i love hoe you can tell it to not play that song again for while. however when using landscape mode it doesn't offer me the future to put on the shelf for a while only in portrait mode it does that.
5015,Pandora,XxxWofie playzXxx,2,0,It was working for someone i know but when i signed up and loged in it wasn't working... can you please fix that.
5016,Pandora,A Google user,5,1,love this app and the prices they offer for premium honestly if they didnt have a option too download offline music on premium package i would have no use for it really because i. have no phone service !! Thank u team pandora
5017,Pandora,Yemi Yemi-Ese,1,1,"Why am I paying for this, and yet still receiving Playlist ads and limits to skips ""due to licensing"". 4/14 update --now the app opens on its own and has no option to close. I have to pause it and leave it in my notification bar(s10+), and it will resume music without me pressing play. It has happened numerous times (at least 12 times) in the span of an hour. Why is this app getting worse over time. deleting it until there is a fix."
5018,Pandora,Amanda Tirey,2,1,I used to love Pandora but ever since the last update a few days ago it's constantly crashing... can't even listen to it. what am I paying for? Time to look for a new music app
5019,Pandora,tammy casey,5,12,I love Pandora. The only problem that I have been experiencing is that music will start playing out of the blue and my cell doesn't show that the application is running. I had to restart my phone one time to stop the music and just uninstalled and reinstalled the app to see if it will stop the problem.
5020,Pandora,Tatum B,2,0,"So, I love the whole ""play music while on another app"" deal but the ads are retarded, I can't listen to music on another app, because, when I get one of those little ads, it force opens the app, and they appear every 5 seconds, even while writing this, it just keeps opening. This issue is a big one, and while, yes, I could get premium, I shouldn't have to, if it's advertising that I can have my music/podcasts playing while I do something else for free, it should stay loyal to that, not cheat me."
5021,Pandora,Joshua Friday,5,13,you need to have music from different countries and different cities and I love this Pandora is awesome oh and Spanish oldies from the 50s to the 60s 70s and 80s and you need to put music from the 1930s through 1940s because I like that type of music to and when it comes to Christmas music I like the old original Christmas music not this new music that you hear now these days from Christmas music thank you peace
5022,Pandora,Robert Durden,5,0,Hi honey l love love you and miss you too baby girl and want see you now or else because I still love you and miss and need to have you now
5023,Pandora,Ernesto Guerrero,1,1,I'd like to manage my subscriptions but when i try adjusting through the app it says that my subscription is managed through google play. When trying to see my subscriptions on google play there is nothing available.
5024,Pandora,pilot tzn,2,7,"VERY STRANGE PROBLEM Great app, aside from this one fatal flaw: It only works on cellular data (and I don't have an unlimited plan). If WiFi is on, it just keeps skipping to the next song every 3 seconds without playing a single note. The website works flawlessly on the same WiFi network, both on this device and my laptop. I tried clearing data, rebooting, reinstalling, etc. with no success. Like I said, it works perfectly on data, but fails completely if WiFi is turned on, even if data is also."
5025,Pandora,Denise Bajish,3,1,"No longer great. Ever since an update a while back where I lost the ability to ""shuffle"" I am unhappy with it. Probably going to drop it."
5026,Pandora,Madison Lawrence,3,3,"I love love love this app...but right now it's making me very angry. I exit out of it, clear it from my app history so nothing's running, and it just starts to play! It started playing three times while I was writing this! Literally, nothing running and it just starts playing, on full volume. I have Pandora Premium and if this isn't fixed soon, I'm withdrawing my subscription."
5027,Pandora,Steve Mackay,1,0,"app plays at most two songs, then locks up, or crashes. Really Pandora? its darn near useless."
5028,Pandora,Natasha Bera,1,1420,latest update sucks! in order to use the app I have to go to my Play Store type in the name and then click open because you're screen icon doesn't seem to work anymore! keeps saying app not downloaded
5029,Pandora,Eric Laib,3,1,"""Pandora gives you a personalized music experience that continually evolves with your tastes"", as long as you stream or redownload your station every day."
5030,Pandora,Amanda Kaiser,2,0,"BEFORE, you'd have maybe 30 mins of music, or more! before a string of commercials. NOW every two songs, there are several commercials that would span the length of one song. Might as well go to YouTube or Spotify."
5031,Pandora,Rosalyn Noisette,4,0,"Tryed out Pandora, thought it was a 1 mo. fee trial. I came out of surgery today to see I can't stop it and have to pay the subscription. Having multiple surgeries, no $$!!!! for a few months. Great APP!!!"
5032,Pandora,Diane Longaker,3,7,"I love pandora...have for years, however WTH is going on in the last week or so? The only way I can close the app now is to completely restart my phone. Hopefully a fix is on the way? Soon? Thanks! :-)"
5033,Pandora,J S,4,8,"pretty awesome! offline mode is great! I wish they would play more songs and variety, I would like to hear the same songs less often!"
5034,Pandora,mike haury,1,9,"can only listen to two or if i'm lucky three of an albums songs it reverts to that artists radio station. i've got plenty of storage on phone and tried clearing cash, no help this needs to get fixed! i downloaded this app because it said i could listen to complete albums."
5035,Pandora,Steve Edwards,1,8,"The app puts so many ads for pandora premium it's annoying. After signing up for the trial, they make it extremely difficult to cancel your subscription. This is not right. Yet another reason I have switched to spotify."
5036,Pandora,Constantine Blayz,1,7,"App will keeps coming back on after closing, or force shutdown. I used to love this App, now when I shut it down it automatically comes back on. I don't like an App that plays music after I shut it off. Too bad, I had to uninstall and will not be coming back. Don't download if you like to have the ability to shut off app."
5037,Pandora,Erin Syfert,3,0,"I used a free version of Pandora for awhile, then I upgraded to enjoy ""ad free listening."" Pandora Plus then started doing promotionals. For the normal user under normal conditions, this might not be a problem. I am a massage therapist and I was thoroughly enjoying the peaceful atmosphere the uninterrupted music created. However, when the room is restful and suddenly a stranger's voice comes bursting into the room...not cool. I dropped my subscription and found reliable, uninterrupted service."
5038,Pandora,Martin Maginity,1,7,"You stopped your support with Ford Sync so now I have to use Bluetooth only. You do have an option for auto launch though.. You know what would be really cool!? It would be awesome if ""auto-launch"" actually Auto launched. Crazy right??? Nope, still have to open up phone, skip through all the ads, then try to find a station while pop-up ads keep coming up and blocking your choices.. ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘"
5039,Pandora,Aaron Shumaker,1,0,"Glad I cancelled this service. Modifying my lock screen. Taking away the ability to shutdown the app. Now I have to go to app manager to shut it down. When it's running and I try to unlock, it freezes for several seconds. I also don't need explicit album covers on my lock screen. So now it's a pain to shut off the app, and if I don't then I have to worry about checking my phone in front of coworkers knowing what pandora might have on my lock screen background."
5040,Pandora,Paul Meyers,2,0,"Paid member since startup long time ago, they keep trying to upgrade me, I can't even listen to 1 new artist 1 song without commercials, very frustrating, not helpful at all."
5041,Pandora,Karalee Done,5,0,I love this app. it's free. the selection is so far for me solid. love love it
5042,Pandora,Brett Kelly,5,0,"By far the best music service, especially the best neutral one. Works on all devices and continues to have the best radio feature of any music service. I tell it to play one song I like then hardly ever touch it again."
5043,Pandora,Wendy Kaminski,1,7,"HELP!! I CANNOT OPEN THE APP SINCE I UPDATED IT LAST NIGHT! I HAVE A SUBSCRIPTION ASWELL! IT SAYS ""SORRY CONTENT NOT AVAILABLE OFFLINE"" THEN IT TELLS ME IT ""WAITING FOR CONNECTION "" BUT I HAVE WIFI PLEASE HELP NOW!"
5044,Pandora,Devin williams,3,0,"It is a good app just needs a few things to make it perfect. You should have the ability to like any song and not just the ones on playlists because it really limits how much the app can personalize the music. I have found many times where it plays songs completely different from the ""category"" that I was listening to. The developers should focus on the ""my thumpbrint"" concept but actually incorporate it into anything you listen to and adapt based on other users on a larger scale."
5045,Pandora,Jared Evans,3,3,"Used to be, from my lock screen, I could exit out of Pandora entirely. I'd use this constantly as I'd close the app so it wouldn't kill my battery when I walked into work. Now I have to open up my phone, go to the app, minimize it, and then close it from the active app list. I know it seems minor, but it's always the minor issues that are the greatest annoyance. Other than that, I'm fine with it, though I do wish there was a way to like artists specifically, so it would play more of their songs."
5046,Pandora,A Google user,1,1,this was 4 stars for me . all of sudden it only plays half through the song and stops. it stops playing totally when my screen turns off. so frustrating since I use app all day and sucks ass right now
5047,Pandora,Renee Walz,4,17,"i enjoy listening to my music, i have a lot of favorites on my playlist, however, it doesn't play them all, and i have set it fpr shuffle"
5048,Pandora,Anna N,1,0,I got charged 2 times for the same music on the same device. i was supposed to have a free trial and they charged me anyway. and i try to reach out and get a refund for my $20 they charged me and now i find out i cant get one. pandora has become horrible. I used to love this app. I don't like being charged when it's supposed to be free. you all need to fix this problem. free should be free otherwise it's called false advertising!!!!!!
5049,Pandora,FRANCESCA EDGHILL,5,2,"fantastic, love the stations. I can switch from rock to 80s or love songs. Sometimes I listen to it about 8 hours a day, while I do my art and crafts."
5050,Pandora,Edgar Armenta,4,0,love the app..does it not work in Germany just got a new phone and it still works on my old one ...
5051,Pandora,Keno Nezami,2,11,"I've liked Pandora overall since it came out, for just Music. Difficult to like Anything tho when it seems like every update, blue moon, 2nd thumbs down, 3rd station change, or 5th Tuesday pisses off or crashes the app. You changed the station function so leaving station 'A' and going back to it continued the song that was playing, it auto-skips now. Ad levels are a bit horrendous even compared to last year, and I've never cared before but it's like: 2 songs, COMMERCIAL. From: WAS a happy user"
5052,Pandora,Brittney Avery,3,11,I've seen a lot of people (including myself) have issues with the app not staying open since the new update. This seems to have been going on for a while so I'm curious to see how Pandora responds. Especially to customers like myself who PAY for the app but haven't been able to use it for over a week now.
5053,Pandora,A Google user,3,0,I was loving Pandora until their last update. Now everytime I do anything else on my phone (like open another window) it just crashes and disappears. Please bring back the features of your 1809.1 version - it worked better than your latest.
5054,Pandora,Samuel Hinterlang,1,0,"Poor suggestions, keeps moving away from genre you try to pick. Will play same one song from an artist and never play another, even if they have hundreds of songs. Just thumb down and skip, and if you thumbs up, you'll get that song so often, you'll hate the song. Seems to only give you 15 songs over and over again, them a 100 long string of songs you never wanted and never asked for."
5055,Pandora,Tierria Stop using my account,3,10,something is going on. its constantly stopping and I keep having to push play. I love this. I pay for this. but all day long the music has stopped. I cant even listen to one complete song without it stopping
5056,Pandora,Robert Freeman,5,2,Pandora is a great music service and enjoy playing music and no ads on Pandora Premium! Robert
5057,Pandora,Mike Agee,1,0,why cant i shut it down..i try x out..but thats the only command that doesnt rrspond..is this intentional.. ???
5058,Pandora,Say Phimmach,5,17,hi every I applied if you don't Bank is it going to take me 5-10 minutes to do my phone it was so fantastic and I have no problem with it Las Palmas Direction and you wouldn't so when you make my day thank God I was going to tell you nice respond for me I like it thankuou
5059,Pandora,Rose Santos,5,10,"I definitely love pandora, because it is constantly giving me just the song I want, and is constantly playing songs I have never heard, but instantly like. Although it is easy for the programming because I will occasionally thumb stuff and add bands I like and stuff. I make the program work for me at its best."
5060,Pandora,Henry Tuell,3,5,Recs fly I can't close the app... Can't close notifications... It starts and leaves notifications up I can't dismiss. I keep having to kill the app over and over and over. Please fix!!!!!
5061,Pandora,Renay Robinson,5,4,I loved this all till it became worthless it crashes every time I open it I can't even use it at work or at the gym or at school or after school bc I'm in this group call JROTC and they hate it bc we can't get it to play anything it sucks this needs to be fixed not giving it a low rate but it needs to be fixed ASAP......!!!!!!!
5062,Pandora,alexa gomez,2,13,"I have been a member of Pandora for a couple of years and absolutely love it. I think it's one of the best music apps out there. since I've updated it, the app will only let me open it for a couple of seconds. I haven't been able to use it for about 5 days now. If I'm paying a monthly payment and cant even listen to my music what is the point? I've sent feedback twice and haven't heard anything back. very upset and disappointed."
5063,Pandora,A Google user,5,4,I signed up for premium now and its just like the advertisement said it would be. No commercial interuptions and skip as many songs as you'd like. Great work Pandora... you. got it figured ðŸ‘ out!!!!
5064,Pandora,A Google user,4,6,"I think the Pandora app. is great. I've used it on my desktop PC for years. I accidentally ended up with a few ""stations"" that weren't intended. I never took the time to learn how to keep the music without being a station. I tell anyone who asks about Pandora that they will like it. I try to ignore any other music apps that throw ads at me. They are definately an annoyance."
5065,Pandora,A Google user,3,0,"However the autoplay when connected to car is supposed to work, it doesn't whenever it's connected to my car bluetooth. Also I used to think the algorithm the service used was better than the other services available when playing music randomly. Now it seems it's just like all the others with repeating the same stuff, even when ""adding variety""."
5066,Pandora,Brian Bell,1,1,why can't I remove a song fron the down thumb rating in the app? so dumb. accidentally hit it a couple times on favorite songs and now they never play. about to go back to spotify..... FIX IT
5067,Pandora,Slurtle,3,0,"Nice variation in music but, for me it keeps stopping randomly and closes the app. Sometimes it won't let me use the app for long periods of time."
5068,Pandora,Mr Joe,4,9,"Same problem as others, keeps cutting out. Samsung s10 plus. Never had problem before. Update...there was a setting on phone that turned off apps so they would not run in the background. This created the problem. Do not turn on for music apps."
5069,Pandora,Kim Busch,3,6,I like that you can shuffle your playlist one issue that I have is in the notification pull-down on my Samsung Galaxy s9 phone it will not shut down the app when I press the x it does nothing. I cannot stop it.
5070,Pandora,Truth Finder,2,3,"WAY too many alincessant and annoying ads. This is pretty much why Pandora isn't as good as it used to be. On the other hand, if your brain is fried and you love experiencing non-stop ads (3-4 ads a increment) any time you do snything, even just to see the artist's or band's name, then this is the app for you! Pandora hasn't yet realized that people in this world don't make it through their day by having to pay attention to mind-numbing advertisements that arent even worth the time of day."
5071,Pandora,david cervantes,1,0,"sick of commercials after a 3 songs, even with subscription, you have a limited amounts of thumbs down or skips. I will switch to Spotify out of principe, after almost 10 years of being a Pandora user, fed up."
5072,Pandora,Cesar Castro,1,1,The last few app updates are no longer compatible with the car app. I particularly have a '17 Honda Accord. The phone I have is a Samsung Galaxy S8 Active. One now has to be on the phone while driving to manually like or dislike songs. So much for a drive friendly app. I have read reviews where multiple users have been experiencing the same issue. There has been replies from support stating this is being reviewed. When will the Pandora app work properly with the Pandora car app across all cars?
5073,Pandora,Brandon Rollins,4,13,"for the most part, I love pandora music. my only complaint is when I hit thre ""x"" to close the app, it only stops the music and doesn't fully close. It remains in my notifications area as well."
5074,Pandora,Serenity Carey,5,10,My favorite music app. I've had it 6 years and have loved it since I got it. I even upgraded to premium. It plays songs I like based on what I've listened to. It introduced me to all my favorite bands and type of music. Pandora Forever!!!
5075,Pandora,A Google user,3,8,i would have given a 5 star because it is normally a great app but the last update made it so where the only way to open the app is by going to the play store and opening it there because the Pandora icon is no longer in my phone in other words the update sucked!!!!!
5076,Pandora,Jax Wise,5,0,awesome app I have had it for 2 years and I never stopped working compared to spotify which after 3 weeks it deleted my account .
5077,Pandora,Gabriel Guzman,1,0,I've never been so frustrated with an app that I was urged to leave a NEGATIVE review. I usually prefer Pandora over other services but lately I've been getting so sick of the app simply not working at all. When I open the app it just sits on the last played song and does nothing. I have great wifi signal but it does not work until I turn on mobile data which I would like to avoid using. Bye bye Pandora!
5078,Pandora,Robin Peeters,1,3,"SO frustrated with Pandora. I've been listening for probably 10 years, paying $10/month for over a year now. When my app stopped working with the last update, I gave them the benefit of the doubt that they would fix the problem in a timely manner, so I kept my account in fear of losing all my curated playlists and downloads, but WHAT'S THE POINT if I haven't been able to listen for two weeks now?! The app crashes within seconds of opening and I've sent the error messages a dozen times, no change"
5079,Pandora,Lance Linkhart,1,4,This app was my Love until this last update on Feb. 15th 2019. Now it opens & as soon as anything starts to play it closes on it's own. I tried to uninstall & reinstall but nothing is working. Will stay at a 1 star until fixed!!!
5080,Pandora,blakedance kinley,3,13,I like this app but if im paying for it like i have for a while now i should be able to get all the songs that are unavailable. There should not be nothing unavailable if you're paying... Would have given 5 stars if there wasn't all the unavailable items..
5081,Pandora,josh g,4,1,"unusable for 3 weeks. I pay for premium. Resolved my issue after review. changed raring to 4 star, would be 5 if a few albums I like weren't unavailable for demand play. but good app."
5082,Pandora,Dani Flau,2,2,I love how pandora works on my Google mini but even though the music is supposed to be playing from my phone i can only control it from my Google mini. In the last week or so pandora stopped putting the controls to play or pause in my notifications so i have to go back into the app to do anything. The last time i added a station the app sent me to pandora premium and played the song without letting me know i was being sent to pandora premium all it said was play this song.
5083,Pandora,Dwayne Ranes,2,1,"the platform of the app is awesome. unfortunately the app has issues. will fail to play music and will show to be ""buffering"" even with full service or on WIFI."
5084,Pandora,Steve Collier,2,1,"Audio is awesome but, being a classical music listener, being restricted to one ""song"" means short parts of each work which is disconcerting. Supposedly I can set Playlist to listen to an entire album, no dice. I'm supposed to cancel my subscription in Google Play but, alas, have found no way to unsubscribe. Sorry Pandora, seems I've opened the wrong box."
5085,Pandora,Michael Scobee,1,1,"20 minutes, less than three songs, already acting up!! Your app failed me !! I don't want it !! This may very well be just an app that gets additional information, along with other apps, asking different questions, from your listeners... Judging your reviews, I don't think your paid app is going to be much better. UNINSTALLING NOW.. SORRY"
5086,Pandora,Ron Weaver,5,13,"sometimes I just want to get a chance to win just one or all of the other winners I want too find out how to make a movie that would make you have too make what you're wanting to get, you know you can't always get "" what you want but"" if you try sometimes "" you just might find :you get what you need. ?............â™¡"

5088,Pandora,Anthony Herrera,1,6,update: all I get from you guys is response back saying to contact your Pandora team there is no team you guys are a joke I will never recommend Pandora to anyone if you're willing to pay $5 for nothing rather than just paying for cheaper music service to get everything ad-free I still want my refund I don't care if it was just $5 this is really ridiculous on how you restrict so much for somebody who's paying money you should really fix your services
5089,Pandora,A Google user,3,0,"this app is not working. i have unlimited data and im also in a wifi hotspot, and it says no connection. i dont know whats going on with it but no matter where i go it doesnt work!! i cant say its exactly your app cause i have even uninstalled it and reinstalled it and still nothing. but my other apps work. Then too it's probably my stupid phone, and i even paid to use this!!"
5090,Pandora,Anthony Mares,3,0,the app is great. theres is a lot of ads frequently. some songs you cant replay. the app has been crashing a lot lately. i dont like how they removed the feature to skip or pause while the phone is locked or that the feature that was removed when you pull down the notifications. the sleep timer sometimes doesnt shut off at the time you set.
5091,Pandora,Aleah Sepulveda,4,1,"this overall is my favorite app to listen to music, but you guys arw having problems because it is starting to crash repeatedly it has done this before ahwile ago also but when that is not happening i am constantly using this app for my music please fix the crashing"

5095,Pandora,Erin Back,5,0,love pandora i would not know what 2do w/o it!!!! js!! always my favorite music playing!!!
5096,Pandora,A Google user,5,23,love the free music ... sure their are ads but if you want free then you have to deal with it and stop complaining. Developing apps is expensive so unless you go make your own hush it
5097,Pandora,Robert Allen,1,17,I've been a premium member for a while now and since this new update the app CONTINUES TO CRASH!! I'm PAYING for this. Super upset right now. This app has been so awesome until now. I'm looking for another option.
5098,Pandora,A Google user,1,0,"won't load in offline mode... can't get App to do anything cause I can't get in it. seems I'm not the only one. I paid for premium, how about you don't access payment until I can use it?!! ðŸ¤¬"
5099,Pandora,Seth Brewer,1,0,"Was great but your server side is definitely having issues lately. Especially when you delete accounts and don't tell the account holder. Suspend it, notify the user and wait, don't just delete it."
5100,Pandora,Kris G,2,0,"Terrible! I've had Pandora since its inception years ago. I'm currently paying monthly for the premium subscription, and have got to say I'm quite disappointed. New phone = the latest android software, and as others have also stated all it does is CrAsH! Every, single, time it's used! I reopen and it'll play for a while then it's off again. Extremely frustrating, thinking of switching to Tidal, as that seems to be working quite well. 2â˜†, I pay for a service that they can't deliver!!"
5101,Pandora,mike beard,1,1,"fix you app!!! have to restart my phone to get it to work!!! AGAIN, FIX YOUR APP!!!!! I HAVE TO RENOOT, UNINSTALL THEN REINSTALL CONSTANTLY!!!! I AM ABOUT TO CANCEL!!!!!!"
5102,Pandora,Shantily Lace,3,1,I've been rocking with Pandora since their early days. I love them. But this latest iteration crashes way too much. Four times in a row this morning.
5103,Pandora,Melissa Crook,3,13,"Great music. Irritating app. Every time this app updates, it disappears from my main screen and I have to haul the widget back up. It also randomly goes into offline mode, even when I have a strong wifi or data connection."
5104,Pandora,Richard Michael,5,8,with the new update if the shortcut button doesn't work just uninstall and reinstall. it will fix your problem. other than that I use Pandora all day every work day. love it.
5105,Pandora,Courtney Jones,1,2,I do I do like the Pandora app. The problem that I have right now is that when I'm on offline mode it will either close out or not let me skip any songs at all. Heaven forbid when I have my data or Wi-Fi on it works fine. I refuse to waste all my data when I pay $10/month to have offline compatibility. Based on to what I've seen in the reviews it appears that others are dealing with the same issue since the update. THIS NEEDS TO BE FIXED.......NOW!!!!!!!!!!
5106,Pandora,A Google user,3,5,"I love pandora, I have used it for years!!!! and have been a premium subscriber for about a year now. This most recent update though, has been nothing short of pure annoyance. The app crashes within seconds of opening, I've uninstalled the app and redownload it. I've considered factory reset on my phone, but before doing so I looked through reviews. although alleviating I'm not the only one as I originally considered. I wonder why the problem still persists. Fix Pandora!!!!! I need my sanity!!"
5107,Pandora,A Google user,1,3,pandora keeps pausing after every song on my android radio. no setting in the app to turn it off.. been like that for weeks now. stop using it because of this..
5108,Pandora,Joyce Holt Godsproperty,5,14,"Love it! easy to use..quick acess to all my favorite apps. however, Im still learning, My grand kids are teaching me i love them babies, they know everything!, about social media."
5109,Pandora,Sue Miller,2,3,I have had Pandora for years and never had an issue until recently. Seriously it needs fixed! Won't even play a full song half the time.
5110,Pandora,Trina M,1,0,"using Pandora on my Android phone. Every time I attempt to edit the station to add variety, Pandora crashes. I have attempted to fix this by turning off and on again, restarting my phone, and even uninstalling and reinstalling the app. Nothing works. It still crashes. Looking into other music apps. They need to fix this. Update: went through several of the reviews and found that Pandora response with directions to a website for help. went to the website and got an error message. Seriously?"
5111,Pandora,Brooke H,3,1,i love the unlimited music but i can't stand the ads on the sleep radios. i dont mind ads but when you use a station that is quiet and then and ads comes on that is so loud it breaks the spell the music created.
5112,Pandora,Erik Zukowski,2,0,plays the same music over and over or music that's not even in the same genre as the music u like I honestly hate pandora
5113,Pandora,Lori Hanks,1,1,"Ever since the update, I can't get the app to even stay open for more than 10 seconds. I'm paying for premium and can't even use it. I'm about to find a new streaming service."
5114,Pandora,Nate Davis,2,6,"really sucks that I had to clear app data so the app would even start. otherwise it would crash immediately. I'm a premium member, and now all of my downloaded music is gone. I assume you'll be refunding me for the app not working for 2 weeks since I pay for it..."
5115,Pandora,Paul Hudson,1,0,"stays open for 2 minutes at a time, doesn't 0lay anything downloaded. I had the premium and couldn't listen to anything I wanted to. last update killed the app. save your time and money and get Spotify"
5116,Pandora,Ewa Zbien,5,5,"When I need my fix for some Jams, I love being able to play my type of music every time on any device that's available to me. I can even shuffle my whole collection of favorites, while looking for other new artists, because they are on a specific station of my type of music. You can do by simply marking the song with a thumb up or down. Pandora remembers your selection. The $10 a month is worth every penny every time. Love using my one subscription I have on my cable box through Xfinity."
5117,Pandora,Lisa Saunders,4,6,"My most favorite guitar player in the world has his own station here with his band, Stoney Curtis Band. Check him out, you won't be disappointed. Also my most favorite Irish Rock Band has their own station too. The Young Dubliners, really fun music to dance to and listen as well. I am willing to bet you will enjoy them too."
5118,Pandora,Savannah Brooke,3,0,"Was nice before the update. Now I can't open it unless I go into Google play every time. when i click on the icon, it says that the app isn't installed"
5119,Pandora,Liz Childress,4,3,"Have use Pandora for my personal and professional use (music in my reception room). Lately, unless my phone is open (Pandora screen in view) the music turns off. I have uninstalled, and reinstalled but nothing changes! HELP! I am so glad to report that I am up and running smoothly without interruption. Thank you, Pandora."
5120,Pandora,A Google user,3,6,"When using the infotainment app in my car, music will start playing but the loading screen doesn't go away unless the audio function is changed to Bluetooth Media and back to the Pandora app. I've experienced this in both my 2018 Impreza, and a 2018 Hyundai Elantra. Also, the app only continues playback when getting back into the car about 50% of the time."
5121,Pandora,Raymond Elmore,2,0,I've had Pandora for a little over a year in the last few months every time I get online to listen to music they have cut back something else I believe if you pay for a service they should have decent music to listen to not cutting license agreement to music every other day
5122,Pandora,A Google user,1,1,"Horrible. Every time I try to download music, halfway through, the app begins to constantly crash. I can't even open it back up. I have to delete the app, install it again, and download the songs again. I'm on the trial, but after it expires, I will not renew. Horrible. I never give bad reviews, but God, this is awful."
5123,Pandora,Malieda Phimvong,1,5,"used to be great but ever since the update, the app crashes during every song and have to restart the app every time. trash. get it together pandora"
5124,Pandora,Lorie Smallen,1,4,"i keep getting an empty app ,with no music,no country at all,very little rock,and when i do get rock it flys right past the song i want to listen to,then theres no way,no arrow to back up to revircs backwards to the song,only a half arrow circle,and a forward arrows, to go forward ,which it does on its own , just keeps going forward, so im not very impressed with this app at all right now."
5125,Pandora,Marcus Hubert,1,0,"Compared to Spotify, Apple Music and Google themselves, Pandora's offerings leave much to be desired. The User Interface is not as polished and more importantly, music that I was able to enjoy on other platforms is not available for playback here. Save your money and leave this app alone until they get their act together."
5126,Pandora,Olivia Reynolds,1,11,updated the app and now it doesnt play on my 2013 ford fiesta. last time this happened i had to wait a couple updates later and then it finally worked again. who knows if that'll happen again or not. So I don't have music in my car anymore.
5127,Pandora,A Google user,5,10,"I really love how you can pick out any music unlike other raidos,and its very easy to work also it brings up the music thats fit for you!!!"
5128,Pandora,Keith Bossinger,3,4,i enjoy the ability to hear what i want...and have for many years. as of the last 6 months...i get ads every 2 songs. i get having to make something...but i may be switching to another app. getting tired of constant ads.
5129,Pandora,Rodolfo Villegas,3,1,Is there a preference between iPhone & Android user? Hardly any ad free hour listening on my Galaxy phone while my wife's iPhone gets offers more than 3 ad free listening throughout the day.. Feel like deleting App..
5130,Pandora,A Google user,1,0,are you kidding me i have to go online to a computer to change my subscription that is completely outrageous to I don't have one I use my phone like most people completely messed up you'll get one month from me but thats all disgusting way you dupe your customers.
5131,Pandora,luis Garcia,2,0,"keeps telling me ""due to licensing restrictions this song can't be skipped right now"". What's the point of paying if i can't get the unlimited skips they say we get when we pay $9.99 a month."
5132,Pandora,selina skelton,2,1,"This app buffers way too often no matter if you have all service possible. I have to force the app to close through settings. If I forget, it kills my battery. This app used to be awesome but lately I've been dissatisfied and seriously thinking about deleting it and going with a better option."
5133,Pandora,Brent Nelson,2,2,"Ever since the latest Android Auto layout change on the Music tab, the Pandora app randomly changes the Album cover image with covers from other artists every 10 seconds. For example a Metallica song will have the album image change to Def Leppard, then to AC/DC then back. It grabs a random image from cache. Sometimes it doesn't change. It's very weird. No other Android Auto music app does this. Only Pandora. Also sometimes the songs don't play and I have to tap the Play icon on each song."
5134,Pandora,Robert Cochran,5,0,"exceptional fantastic loving caring energizing app thank you so much Pandora ,to every supporting member work and volunteer thank you God bless."
5135,Pandora,Jade Miller,5,1,i love this app you can listen to your favorite songs and listen to something new then you fall in love with it and i love that it's not like YouTube or Spotify you don't have to search for Everything thing that means that you can't listen to something new
5136,Pandora,Zach Roberts,2,3,"I love music on pandora and all the features of premium, but.... Why cant i sort music alphabetically anymore... this is a huge annoyance!!! new layout is dreadful!"
5137,Pandora,BA M,3,7,"I have had Pandora for a long time and they have an amazing service; My three star rating isn't for the service itself, but for the interface. I have had both the paid and free versions of Pandora, and despite the ads and limited skips with free, I feel it is still the easier interface. The paid version interface is overly complicated and tries to do too much. I found it really difficult just to switch between my stations. Simplify the interface and I'll go back to paid."
5138,Pandora,Eric Hernandez,5,7,"I've been using pandora for a while! I love it!! but there's something wrong with it right now at the moment. it keeps kicking me out of the app and saying "" sorry this content or action is not available online."" if put okay it will also say this too ""waiting for a connection? try again!"" it's been doing for the last 2 days. anyway you guys can fix this?"
5139,Pandora,Vanessa Carpio,1,7,why hasn't there been a fix or a response on why the app continues to pause in the middle of the song or right after it and i have to unlock my phone constantly to have it start up again.
5140,Pandora,John Hanson,2,3,"A good service for music but technologically needs work. Needing to update billing information which I found I can't do thru the app, directed to the website. What a pain, but fine, go to the website and any button option given is based on being on my smart device and there is no login, only a redirection to the app, which of course I can't update thru. I uninstalled the app, logged in still no option to edit my profile, but linked me to install the app. That's bad tech."
5141,Pandora,Jennifer H,1,0,"in the last couple weeks this app has gone from my favorite to one I can't even use any longer. it constantly shuts down a minute or so into every song. I had to go download a different music app, but I have to say i am disappointed. i will try it again after the next update happens, but if issue still not rectified I will have to uninstall. I see through the comments that many are experiencing the same problem, so hopefully you guys can resolve issue..."
5142,Pandora,Mandie Denise,1,68,"won't even play 1 song without cutting off. repeats the same songs all the time, and it's not worth the 4.99. uninstalling"
5143,Pandora,A Google user,1,0,not worth the 10 bucks a month. they limit how many skips you get. the volume is set to a really low and then alot of the songs you cant even collect due to licensing. pandora is a scam
5144,Pandora,Wendy Purcella,5,3,"I have had Pandora for a couple of months now, I love it! However lately I've been noticing in the middle of any song I'm listening to the program will just stop all together exit out of itself and I have to go back into the app and reopen it just to continue the song. I'm hoping there's a fix for this as I really don't want to go anywhere else for music especially since I pay a monthly subscription to stop all the adds. Any suggestions?"
5145,Pandora,Desiree Ballard,5,3,"love it. been a memeber for about 8 years now. doesn't interupt my other phone settings, ex: google maps. always alerts me new songs from fav. artists"
5146,Pandora,Allan schmaltz,1,25,"I wanted this app to play relaxing music for my little one to sleep to, but the ridiculously loud ads that come on make it impossible. uninstalled."
5147,Pandora,Michael Cumberledge,5,1,My Premium account stopped because Of non payment I paid for it then found my offline playlist were Erased. So I tried to re download everything to listen to music offline. And it says it's downloaded but when I switch it to offline there's nothing there. it Says I have it downloaded any music. what do I do to fix this? I've tried everything That I know about the Pandora app.
5148,Pandora,Cassandra Hall,1,0,I hate that I cannot cancel the subscription through the app! my work compter is not allowing me to access pandora the whole point of the subscription. I am being charged for somthing I cannot use!
5149,Pandora,Suquana Jackson,5,0,"Outstanding App. Overall!!!!!! My children and I love it! I would reccomend this app to my friends, colleagues, and family. No matter the mood nor the type of day that you're having, PANDORA is the best number one app to download on your device selection. I love listening to gospel, pop, dance, r&b soul, r& b hip hop, classical jazz, and country."
5150,Pandora,Maria Quiroz,1,0,"I know you guys are trying to get people to subscribe and get paid by the ads but I had to install this annoying app. The music genome project would've been great if it wasn't so general. If I make a station with one artist because of their style, I don't need the artist of another station popping up because I ""liked"" it. I listen to different genres and I swear I can't find anything new. Maybe one song or artist every 4 months but not great for people who LOVE music, not just enjoy it."
5151,Pandora,ML AS,1,0,I ised to love this app however now it's been locking up every damn time it plays the Dove commercial. I get there's commercials but it shouldn't freeze up every time that particular commercial plays!!! please remove this add!!!
5152,Pandora,Monica Perry,1,4,"I haven't been able to use my app for weeks now. It crashes within seconds of opening. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. This is especially frustrating since I am actually paying for the subscription. I have tried reinstalling and restarting and every other suggestion online and nothing has worked. Please, please, please fix this!!"
5153,Pandora,Percy Bohannon,1,23,since the last update the icon won't even pop up in my app drawer. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app and restarting my phone but nothing seems to work
5154,Pandora,Melanie Siedler,1,1,"the last 2 days, it will start a song when played on my cell phone and then shut off. restart a new song and then shut off. getting old."
5155,Pandora,Angel Cleary,1,0,"for the last 2 weeks I have been trying to listen to my pandora,and for some reason it kicks me off,I paid my subscription,if it continues I will not subscribe no more and I will delete it."
5156,Pandora,Deborah Edwards,4,108,"Love the music selection. However, a commercial plays every time you change the station. Not good for my Uber passengers."
5157,Pandora,Cha Tipler,2,15,"Since the update, I now have to go into my settings to ""force stop"" the app to remove it from my homescreen and notification bar. It's more of a hassle than it's worth. I'll change my rating if this is fixed."
5158,Pandora,jo c,5,1,My app kept crashing and I have fixed the problem. I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 8 so this only applies to this phone or phones similar operating systems. Follow these steps on your device: 1. settings 2. Apps 3. Choose Pandora 4. Click on Storage 5. Click on Clear Data and then clear data 6. Go back to your Pandora App and re-sign in. Problem should he solved as mine was! Good luck!
5159,Pandora,Kimberly B,1,8,"Was every other, now every single song stops 1/4 through the song. Pandora turns off completely and the app closes completely. Literally unable to listen to one damn song! 3/23/19 Currently, Pandora stops playing 60-75 seconds into absolutely every song. It is a shame. Was hoping to pay for an upgrade. Absolutely will not happen now. Can not even use the app. Will try again in a month or so. Will uninstall permanently if it continues. Will not be notifying tech support. Should not have this prob."
5160,Pandora,A Google user,3,1,"We upgraded to Pandora Premium, which offers many possibilities in music. However, we are finding this app doesn't seem to allow for deleting certain music types, like albums. You have to delete each song, which is irratating! The app needs to be upgraded to accommodate the new elements of Premium."
5161,Pandora,Raymond Milner,1,2,"Latest update does not allow me to close the app on my Note 8. I have to force stop it to prevent using battery and data streaming. Station and playlist option is great though. I love the music and function, just need to be able to shut it down."
5162,Pandora,Makenna Robinson,5,3,Amazing app 5 stars not only do i love the aesthetic but the app in general is just great you can make lots of different playlists listin to songs of your choice and they have so many songs that are hard to find too!
5163,Pandora,TiKkO Rome,3,2,"They don't pay artists nearly enough but the app itself is better than FM radio because you can choose stations that play what you like and discover new music that fits your tastes. My biggest complaint is that it stopped working with the Pandora app in my Cadillac's CUE system and neither Pandora nor GM seem to care about resolving the issue, despite this apparently being fairly common."
5164,Pandora,Joseph Miles,1,1,"keeps immediately skipping without playing songs. used to be great. now, literally unusable. 0 music plays. loads album cover image, then skips to next song... repeat."
5165,Pandora,Steve H,5,111,"Great source for music, well worth the purchase price for no commercials, no ads and being able to select specific songs/albums."
5166,Pandora,A Google user,1,1107,love the music but HATE the app.... why the hell do you ask if I'm still listening to pandora after just one song??? you people suck...
5167,Pandora,Tamblyn McKines,1,0,"I use to love this app but over the last couple of days since the last update it's been hell! It keeps stopping or in the event it miraculously plays for a few minutes, it starts shuffling various songs without actually playing them just shuffling the titles. It's very disheartening to have something your paying for a premium monthly subscription for it not to work. I will give it until the end of the month for pandora to get their *#@% together if not I will be canceling my subscription!"
5168,Pandora,Jacob Bennett,3,0,"Great service, but I'm not happy with the ad placement, could be done better. I'm only writing this review because I have been woke up by your ads, I get angry, then go to sleep in a bad mood. If I'm listening to classical music that is soft and quiet, then your loud obnoxious ad comes on to wake me up, I'm not happy. You punish people for not paying for plus, which is why I'm switching to another music streaming service, Im willing to pay for services that are focused on the customer over money"
5169,Pandora,Caitlyn Bonner,1,0,"It has been two days now where I've been unable to play music, all it says is buffering. I dont have a connection problem, so that doesnt make sense. I renewed my premium account hoping that would solve the issue and it didn't. So now I'm paying 10$ for a music app that wont even let me view the songs ive saved so I can listen to them on a different application. Honestly pandora is the superior music app, but this is just aggravating. I uninstalled the app and reinstalled that didn't work either"
5170,Pandora,A Google user,1,2,The last few days the app will open randomly and start playing. I've tried everything and it keeps doing it! I am just about done with it...
5171,Pandora,brandon honea,1,2,listened to pandora for the last 3 years trouble free until this last month. constant notification on phone wont go away and the pandora app for my sync doesnt hardly work anymore. i spend more time trying to reset apps and disconnect and reconnect to get it to work i started listening to amazon. this needs to be fixed
5172,Pandora,Marla Knox,2,0,Used to love this app I pay for a subscription to have unlimited skips and downloads but since I got my galaxy s10 plus the app isnt working anymore it skips through my playlists and wont play certain songs anymore and also wont allow me to download anymore a message pops up that says I dont have enough space on my phone and I have 528 Gigs of storage... please fix
5173,Pandora,Karina Buezo,1,0,audio quality is terrible for specific genres. it feels too equalized and it's not compatible. makes my music sound very compressed. I dont know how to fix this.
5174,Pandora,Kylee Dunn,5,0,"i been using pandora sincs beta after finsing it on stumble upon. the first month beta was unlimited and you would find way more diverse. i was discovering new music everyday, stations player a bigger rNge but eventually would cycle back. its still great but miss that"
5175,Pandora,Esther R,4,8,now Pandora is better than before. thanks for not mix it up Christian music with secular music. thank you again.ðŸ¤—
5176,Pandora,Ryan Kaiser,4,0,Even though I have full service Pandora has been having an issue with loading songs. I've already uninstalled and reinstalled Pandora three times this week just to get it to play.
5177,Pandora,Jose Fermin,4,3,"The app keeps opening! and its getting really annoying. I close it, and it will randomly start playing music."
5178,Pandora,Jared Manuel,2,3,crashes constantly after new update.have had pandora for at least 5 years....no problems..updated yesterday now cant get through 1 song without crashing.way to go on the update.who cares about podcasts?theres youtube for that
5179,Pandora,Rob D,2,4,"I had left Pandora premium a while back to try other music streaming services thinking none would be as good. When I came back to Pandora, I now realize how bad it actually is. There are MANY songs that can't be downloaded, the algorithm that determines which music to play based on a certain song is pretty bad and leaves me skipping from song to song way too much to be able to enjoy listening to music, and worst of all, they make it so difficult to cancel your subscription."
5180,Pandora,Dalton Spencer,1,0,"I have been a long time user and lover of pandora, but with the last update being released my app on my galaxy s8 crashes constantly. In order to even get 30 minutes of play time I have to delete then reinstall the app every 30 minutes. I'm sure support is bombarded right now, but I haven't even been able to get in contact with anyone after opening several tickets. I pay for this pandora plus and now I can't even utilize it, ridiculous."
5181,Pandora,Doc Davis,1,6,"New update broke my app. I now have to restart my phone several times to get it to connect to my sonos. I filed a complaint on your help page and all I got was a ""clear your data"" response. Well no kidding, wish I would have thought of that before. it did nothing except make the problem worse."
5182,Pandora,William Kemerer,3,6,"Recently changed for the worse. I have a google pixel 2, fully updated. I have used pandora for years and years, ups and downs, but mostly good. Now, I cant understand why recently the app puts a mini player in my notifications pull down that CANNOT be closed. there is an x in the corner that does nothing. if i go to all the open apps on my phone and close it there, the mini player still there. Restart my phone, still there. uninstalled and reinstalled, still there. Please fix, killing my batt."
5183,Pandora,A Google user,2,0,"i really enjoyed Pandora until there was a update in December of last year. I feel like a am wasting money on an app that doesnt work correctly. I can not listen to any of the songs and stations i have saved i can not skip to the next song and its always stopping in the middle of the song and going to the next song. The app was updated recently and now the songs keep ""buffering"""
5184,Pandora,April Gonzalez,4,0,"I love having no ads but I don't like not being able to download certain songs to my playlists and not being able to skip certain songd because of "" licensing."" I pay for Pandora Premium and should have access to anything I want to add to my play lists and unlimited skips as advertised. All in all, I do enjoy Pandora."
5185,Pandora,s r,5,0,It is a very good music experience. To get extra features all you have to do is watch an add. I love it
5186,Pandora,Bill Boss,2,2,"I have had an account with Pandora for over ten years now. I used to love this app. The ads have become so dominant over the music, it is unbearable to listen to! I remember when you had to pay a penny to listen to more music once you reached a certain amount. I would like to know the monetary amount of a 6 hour day of streaming with ads. I'm sure the ads would suffice as payment. The ads are worse than FM radio now! It is very frustrating being pushed away with so many personal stations."
5187,Pandora,Amber D. Hunt,5,8,"I have had one unique experience with Pandora. The only thing is, I am legally blind, and use TalkBack, and the problem I'm running into is that when I go to add a song to a playlist, for some reason it is not reading me the list of playlists to add a song to, and I'd like to know what I'm adding to before I tap on it. What is going on here?"
5188,Pandora,Stoneclover 47,1,0,This app sucks. I only like specific songs but it has what i like. But your telling me that I have to spend money for a playlist. Yea screw you. Spotify should be #1 in music.
5189,Pandora,A Google user,5,10,"amazing! has every single song you are looking for! it's like being in YouTube, except it's only for music! oh, I recommend an artist called ""NF"". I â™¡ his music. Also, they have song lyrics to almost all of the songs!"
5190,Pandora,A Google user,3,10,its a great music app but lately my playlists won't all download for offline listening also whats the point for paying extra for playlists when most songs are radio only?! Almost all of my Three Days Grace songs are radio only :\ it never used to be like this.
5191,Pandora,Bhagwan Singh Khanka,1,6,"this is turning to be a nuisance now there is no way to stop pandora from auto playing in my car. even when i am on a phone call and i enter my car, pandora starts playing instead of my phone call. I dont want to have the Pandora plus if they cannot fix this issue soon"
5192,Pandora,A Google user,1,0,"do not get premium membership! i signed up for premium membership on my phone and have been trying to cancel it but apparently you can only cancel it by going on an actual computer. so i am going to leave bad comments and reviews everywhere possible until they change this. it is ridiculous, them making it harder to cancel than to sign up is a sleezy business tactic and they should be ashamed of themselves."
5193,Pandora,Jaelynn Bill,2,0,it wont stay on unless i am ON the app the whole time. this has been going on for over a year and it still isnt fixed. if i try to do anything else on my phone while it plays it shutsoff.
5194,Pandora,N. Bb D. Bb,2,0,"well i loved this app until today, it didn't let me play any music despite having wifi and when i updated it it still didn't do anything fix this i have enough to stress about and music helps me and YouTube is a pain in the ass"
5195,Pandora,Delfino Rodriguez,1,0,This app crashes constantly if you pay for premium. I haven't taken Pandora off of offline mode in months because it won't work in online mode. I don't know why I keep paying for it.
5196,Pandora,Shell Bell,3,9,"you're forcing me to thumbs down certain songs because you play it over and over until i dont like it anymore. and it stops playing, so i have to go offline and those songs are songs thar constantly play. I never hear anything new."
5197,Pandora,andre aiken,1,0,I'm a uber driver and it is very frustrating that the app keeps crashing. I tried to reinstall the app after uninstalling it but now I can't even download it! please fix this problem!
5198,Pandora,Jessica P,4,1,"love it...except.... the app always starts up in my car even with the setting turned off. I don't hear the music, which is fine since I don't want it to automatically play. However, I am unable to turn off the app. The notification bar will not close. I have to force stop the app to close it."
5199,Pandora,Michelle Mott,1,0,"about to cancel I pay for the subscription and it stop/cuts out about every other song. SO ANNOYING. I've rebooted, uninstalled, reinstalled. Spotify might be getting my business very soon if this is not fixed ASAP"

Closed app, logged out and back in, restarted phone. Decided to go to a different music app instead. No problems there. i pay for the upgrade om Pandora and I still cant listen to my music when i want to. starting to wonder in its worth the measly $10 bucks"
5201,Pandora,Brian Kennell,1,2,"After purchasing Pandora Premium, all it does is re-play's my likes over, and over, and over again. Is this Pandora's scam??? When I had the free version, it was always playing new songs, and songs from new groups. Now that Pandora got my money, all I get is repeats all day long."
5202,Pandora,James Kilpatrick,3,0,This app was working perfectly until the last update where I am no longer able to replay a song as the reply button is not functional on the music controller when I access it the lockscreen of my Galaxy S10+. I know that this is an issue with the app as the same issue is present on my Galaxy Note 8. I downloaded Spotify and all of the music controls work perfectly on both my S10+ and my Note 8 so I know that this is an issue with the app. Please fix this as I don't want to switch to Spotify!
5203,Pandora,James McNelly,4,0,"Has been a great app. Since I use it while driving Uber/Lyft, every day I start shuffling my stations, I keep hearing the same songs all the time. Pandora needs to shuffle the song lists on their stations so there aren't so many repeats. I may have to explore another service if they cannot mix it up better."
5204,Pandora,A Google user,1,0,"I've been a long time listener and premium subscriber for years. oldest app in my phone. litterally went from the best app to the worst overnight. it doesn't really do any good to write a review because it won't be read, the problem fixed, or bring back my huge song list, my large ""off line"" collection or my many, many created radio stations that were litterally lost overnight. with a a subscription. I put ALOT of time, energy, and thought into my vast collection. for nothing!"

I used to really like pandora but she has not been cooperative"

I can only see Waze for half a second before Pandora takes over the screen every single time I try to open Waze or click on ways to view the map Pandora closes it and stas on top. super annoying uninstalling and giving YouTube music a try
5211,Pandora,Jacki B,1,2,I've tried for 2 weeks to cancel my trial and still have not found the way to unsubscribe. It's not because I didn't like it. I used it just one time. I did learned one thing and will be sure to pass it on. DON'T SIGN UP FOR TRIALS UNLESS YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO JOIN.

5215,Pandora,Patrick Mulholland,1,3,"I used to use this daily as the go-to for music and comedy shorts. The last year I've paid for premium and plus. Simply put, this offers good exposure to some new music, however, easy to get free on other apps. This crashes more than my other apps since 2/2019, no longer can skip songs due to licensing restrictions regardless of payment for plus? just.... why? uninstalled today. sad for the app, good memories dying like Luke Skywalker for Pandora trying to squeeze people."
5216,Pandora,A Google user,1,10,I am a paying customer. Pandora gets 1 star for crashing when I try to use the app since yesterday. I sent several feedback messages and I have not received any response. Please come up with a fix quickly before I cancel my subscription.
5217,Pandora,BilldozerMBM,2,0,"I've been using Pandora for around 6 or 7 years and finally decided to upgrade to premium recently and loved it. But, I'm not sure if it was the last update or what but, now my app won't stop crashing any time I open it. I've been reporting the issue for omost a month now with no patch or update and Pandora still decides to charge me my monthly fee regardless of un-useable service."
5218,Pandora,Angel Fuentes,3,1,what happend to night mode? I'm a premium member the option was there before. I updated the app is the night feature no longer available?

5220,Pandora,Jeri Rhea,5,1,I love Pandora. The assortment of music and artists combined make it even better. I love the thumbs up option to keep my songlist preferences too. I love the assortment of singer/songwriter and folk rock. It's just a great app and definitely my go-to for music whether in my car or anywhere.
5221,Pandora,A Google user,1,6,I have absolutely had enough of your stupid app telling me I don't have internet when I do. This is enough. first YouTube now you. apparently everyone wants to get ddosed. Edit: your site refuses to alllw screenshot upload. Less than one star update. and why http instead of more secure https? UNINSTALLED
5222,Pandora,David Smith,1,0,"a recent update caused the ""launch from car"" feature to automatically ALWAYS switch to shuffle. why would anyone want this? in fact it's so incredibly annoying i have switched to spotify."
5223,Pandora,Jacob L.,1,0,OMG......SHUT OFF ALREADY. this program literally never turns off AND there is no off button in the program. you literally have to use 3rd party apps to turn it off. Double you want me to be a subscriber or not? It also over uses data on my mobile plan due to auto unpausing every time my car turns on and running music when I have paused and muted it. Do you folks even product test? Do you just not care? I have been fined over $300 usd because it unpauses by default when android auto connects.
5224,Pandora,Danielle Bradford,4,2,i think that Pandora is great and it is awesome for when you want to listen to music offline because if you download the songs you like then you can listen without WiFi
5225,Pandora,Katie T,2,2,pandora wont work. it says station currently not available. try another one. i tried other stations. none of them work.
5226,Pandora,Sam Graham,1,2,You can only download so much music. When you sign out you lose all downloaded music and stations. When you try to start to re-download all your lost music it doesn't recognize anything. It won't let me download anything now except over wi-fi even though I've changed it in settings for cellular data download. It takes forever to switch to offline. When it eventually does it plays one song then quits. You can set up premium on your phone BUT have to be on an actual computer to cancel your subscri
5227,Pandora,A Google user,3,3,I like Pandora but when I clicked to get 30 day free trial its wouldn't accept my provider billing so I hit subscribe. It then billed me immediately and said Payment successful? It was even provider billed? I thought I was getting 30 day free trial of premium but all I got was subscribed to commercial free for $4.99 a month? To me the ads aren't worth $4.99 a month. I wanted to try premium
5228,Pandora,Jerome Phillips,1,0,I have had ongoing issues with technical problems with my premium subscription with the Pandora app for more than two consecutive months. And they don't offer any live customer service to report problems to or resolve the problems or rectify the issue with refunds. In closing I'm very unsatisfied with not being able to speak with someone live or a customer service representative in regards to any issues.
5229,Pandora,kadetra brown,1,1,what's going on with this app?! mine hasn't worked for the last week or so. I've never had problems before. I love this app... please fix!
5230,Pandora,A Google user,3,3,Two annoying bugs in this app that I wish they would fix. The first is that it automatically starts with Android Auto. Setting it to not auto start does not work within the app. I have to change the music app inside Android Auto to something like Googe music to fix it. The other bug is the notification on my S7 Edge that won't go away. Please fix them.
5231,Pandora,Kenneth,3,0,"skips a lot. I've tried deleting, then re-installing. The settings are set to give the best quality. Yet the skips are still there. It didn't do this before, but it does now."
5232,Pandora,Laura Baker,5,0,wondering how come you can't use the thumbs-up thumbs-down option anymore to rate the song
5233,Pandora,Mr Schittzy,2,0,"this app is an a-hole. it's only good if you pay $10 a month for premium. the radio part of it is pretty good but I like to make playlists, and this app takes away a lot of my favorite songs at random and says they are now radio only. there are also a few explicit songs I can't find. these problems still happen even when paying for premium"
5234,Pandora,Kaisle,4,2,"Great app, has most songs and podcasts I try to find and works well. However, it takes an astounding number of taps to the simplest things."
5235,Pandora,andy crossman,1,5,"Uninstalled. Used everyday for years but couldn't deal with the battery drain anymore. Every time i get into my car the app launches, no way to prevent it. For some reason there is a lot of battery drain associated with this even though their developers claim there isn't. Moving to another provider that listens to their customers (unlike Pandora). Search for the issue... Update: New pixel 3, fresh install, same problem. ""Launch from car"" unchecked, app still open in background."
5236,Pandora,Dawn Watson,1,2,"Extremely frustrated Like a lot of people on here I have had premium pandora and was working great, but now it starts snd then says Pandora app has stopped. I sent in to report it and if course haven't heard anything. I did get it to work once after uninstalling and reinstalling. After I stopped listening for a while and then tried later same problem. Pandora continues to stop. Its not the free ap so it should be fixed immediately but as others have stated its been going on and on."
5237,Pandora,reggie staten,1,0,since this past weekend the app closes seconds after opening. iv tried uninstalling and lost all my downloaded songs. i pay the premium amount and i am very close to switching to another music streaming service.
5238,Pandora,A Google user,1,10,I pay for Pandora Premium and usually love it tbh. I have had a couple of complications of it sometimes downloading things weird but I let that go. The last update however seriously messed up the app for me. I can MAYBE play a song for 4 seconds before the app crashes and it crashes constantly. At this point I can't use the app which is pretty much the only music app I use besides Youtube. This is a serious frustration
5239,Pandora,Anthony Guidi,1,7,"edit 3.26.19 Pandora never responded. probably because they couldn't recreate the problem or do it very easily. I figured out the issue anyway (I think) After locally downloading music from Pandora past the 9.5 or 10 GB point, the app seems to get to bogged down with checking remaining downloads against what you've selected to download.Then at certain point the app stops downloading music and just pretends like it is. you think you're downloading, when you're just telling it to download."
5240,Pandora,A Google user,1,0,"Useless app. I pay for premium. and none or the features I pay for, actually work. cant play the songs I've downloaded, cant find songs in want, and the app crashes repeatedly. DO NOT BOTHER"
5241,Pandora,Brenda Medina,1,0,"Was charged twice for subscription but told they DON'T refund anything!!!! Not happy with this. We were on two separate free trials. Once up, I switched to the family plan. We were both on same plan the last day of free trial, but was charged for one family plan and one single plan. I even logged in to both accounts and both showed family plan, so there was no other subscription to cancel. So I report this and they come back with WE DONT REFUND BUT ENJOY YOUR SUBSCRIPTION...."

5268,Pandora,Fern G,1,7,"Not good, Pandora. For someone to cancel premium subscription you have them jumping over and through a hoops. Basically, you make it inconvenient to cancel. For this you get 1 star. Your a Sly Saleman. Keep it easy how others (apps) do to unsubscribe, throught the Playstore or iTunes. No excuses. Do not reply but listen and take corrective action. Now I have to open my laptop to unsubscribe. Thanks alot!"

5272,Pandora,A Google user,3,5,"I did a trial of Pandora Premium. The service is fine, but if I want to cancel the premium subscription, I should be allowed to do so from the app. Unless you work at a desk, it is difficult to gain access to a regular computer these days, and Pandora knows it. Its clearly just a dirty trick to get people to pay for something they don't need/want. They could have done the easy thing by adding the capability to the app and allowing one to choose the free version. Instead, I will be doing neither."
5273,Pandora,Steven Szabo,1,6,"ever since the update, I am unable to use the app. says buffering or cant run while offline. i purchased the monthly subscription so i can go offline. now i am paying for something i cant use. please fix or i may have to cancel. 2 weeks of this is gettimg old"

5282,Pandora,Mrs Cheryl Hall,5,10,the best I really enjoy listening to Pandora is just too many ads and if you want to skip you had to wait but the way that avoid all of that is to buy the prescription which I really didn't want to do since it was supposed to be free but if you like your oldies but goodies like I do what can you do so of course I had to pay for the prescription I still really enjoy Pandora cuz I get to choose what I listen to and don't have to wait not a big fan of waiting either you do or you don't hope you enjo

5292,Pandora,Daniel Laster,2,3,love the app but can't get premium on phone because they do not have a trustworthy and secure payment method. my information has been hacked through gpay by very securable means on Google's side and I refuse to use them again for any service due to their constant attempts to cheat me out of my refund after finding clear evidence of fraud. its unfair to be forced to use gpay to get premium services.

5301,Pandora,Brittani White,2,0,Recently started changing my radio station out of the blue. Sorry but if I wanted to listen to country Id put it on there. Fix the app and Ill pay to continue my subscription.
5302,Pandora,Ana Lewis,2,5,"It's a good app, if yoy like listneing to the same songs everyday on repeat. It claims I have over 740 liked songs, but it just plays the same 5 over and over. I don't understand why I have to unlock my phone and pause the music, when it used to show up on the lock screen."
5303,Pandora,A Google user,2,2,"Whenever I have Pandora on, I cannot go to another app or turn my screen off without Pandora shutting down. This didnt used to happen but it's gotten much worse. Extremely frustrating. Cant even use GPS @ the same time."
5304,Pandora,A Google user,1,0,"I have premium, it shuts down after just a few seconds once opened. I've tried reinstalling twice with no luck. First time I've had a problem in the year I've been paying for it."
5305,Pandora,jennifer teel,1,0,I just found out that I've been being charged monthly $9.99 for many many months without my permission. I've contacted customer service and will update/change this rating when this problem is resolved. Thank you

5307,Pandora,Lydia Robledo,1,0,I love listening to pandora the only thing i hate is that the app will not close properly. I tried closing it & will apear back. Even if i uninstall it i see the icon on my phone.
5308,Pandora,A Google user,1,2,Will never use again. You sign up for a free trial and then you have to sign into the website from a computer to cancel it. Real shady way to get people stuck paying for your subscription when they no longer want it. You suck!!
5309,Pandora,Connie Stevens,1,2,"I don't know what's going on with pandora, I can no longer enjoy my music. It keeps pausing and skipping from song to song I've done everything to correct the problem and nothing has worked. The sad thing is I'm paying for no commercials and it sucks. I have a long drive to work so I only listen to my offline music on pandora."
5310,Pandora,A Google user,1,0,i mad i installed this app and i subscribe to plan with another phone and now i cannot cancel it so im im pretty mad and it wasn't your date u cannot be in a basement and her music and it take a lot of storage ðŸ˜Ÿ and they don't help you with nothing i tried to contact them but they never responded back to u. i am very madðŸ‘¿ðŸ‘¿ðŸ‘¿ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤ðŸ™ðŸ™.
5311,Pandora,Alissa Wasmiller,1,2,I am a premium member for awhile now. I use to be able to listen on my phone and leave music playing on my Alexa for my pups while I'm away. but now It says only one person can listen at a time... also a ton of buffering even on the offline.. what gives? thinking of switching to spotify. anyone else use spotify ?
5312,Pandora,Karen Everette,5,3,"The P for Pandora is not on my phone. It, in other words, i cant turn my phone and push the""P"" from the front of my phone. ive already downloaded it too!"
5313,Pandora,Richard Mock,1,1,completely unhappy with the app. continuously stops anytime i listen to more than one song. hope the problem is fixed soon.
5314,Pandora,Alyssa Michaud,5,0,love pandora!! I tried spotify for a months and it doesnt compare in my opinion.
5315,Pandora,Quandrae Mccord,1,0,"been using and paying for this app since 2017. the last week it hasn't been letting me log in so today I deleted my account, not gonna pay for something I can't use."
5316,Pandora,Miguel Zuniga,3,0,Used to let me play all the songs the whole album. Now whenever I want to hear music of every album. Only 3 or 4 tracks play and that's it. Can you please fix this problem?
5317,Pandora,Christopher,1,0,"unlimited skips my butt. skip six or seven times and get hit with ""due to licensing issues you can not skip this song"". So what am I paying for? For you to lie about unlimited skips? That's the whole reason I payed for you. Now I cant even cancel my subscription. Its 100x easier to cancel my damn card."
5318,Pandora,A Google user,5,1,"All I Have To Say Is For 2 Years I Have Found All The Songs & Hits, I Remember Listening To When My Age Was A Lot More Energetic. This App Deserves Many, Many Kudos... Tiny Tim"
5319,Pandora,Kelsey Brown,1,1,"keeps stopping everytime I start playing music on any station. this did not happen until recently, about a week ago. have not been able to fix on my own and sounds like others are experiencing the same issue.....havnt been able to use it at all and am ready to get rid of it."
5320,Pandora,S Ervin,1,0,"horrible. worst ad invasion of any app I've ever downloaded (and I've downloaded some pretty sketchy apps) and has gotten continually worse. i don't mind reasonable ads but i can hardly use the app due to persistent ad posts. now it's interfering with other apps because it doesn't have a shut down option. after many years of using Pandora, I'm done and uninstalling. there's many other free options without the ridiculous level of ads they force through. is it money troubles or greed, Pandora?"
5321,Pandora,david ohler,1,4,this app shuts down about every 5 minutes. Why would I even consider paying for something when the free stuff doesn't even work. I don't use it very often and I forget each time that I turn it on how frustrating it is
5322,Pandora,Millie Wilson,3,13,i love pandora and have for years but they seriously just updated and now the shortcut app is missing off my phone. the app still works but no way to remake the shortcut all of the sudden
5323,Pandora,Maleia Danyail,1,5,For some reason for about the last month my Pandora will not play music. When I turn on Pandora I'm not able to click any of the buttons and it just keeps skipping songs before they even start. I have used Pandora for years and have always loved it. I hope there is a way the problem can be fixed.
5324,Pandora,Veronica Nieto,2,3,"I have been having issues with Pandora. For the last month Pandora has continually been buffering. The station doesn't even play music, just buffers and skips to the next song, then the next and the next. Not pleased at all with Pandora and it was my favorite music app."
5325,Pandora,James Jannett,2,2,"App keeps crashing over and over again, I may possibly get though a song or two, if that, before it crashes."
5326,Pandora,Barbara Elaine Roe Mullins,5,2,"I didn't know it cost. I don't want it, $10.00 is too much to pay for music when I can get music for free. I tried to cancel my free trial and I didn't see any of the stuff that was in the instructions for canceling. I've had the free trial for 10 minutes so I shouldn't get charged. Will someone let know if I am cancelled or not? Please."
5327,Pandora,Marvell Dean,1,4,My Pandora premium has not been functioning properly. I keep having to uninstall and reinstall the app. This is not acceptable seeing as to how my money keeps getting taken without receiving quality service. It seems as if Pandora is taking their time fixing the problem. may need to find a new source for my music
5328,Pandora,Arturo Gonzalez,1,0,"I'm paying for premium. Pandora wouldn't open for the last 2 weeks, I kept getting a pop up stating unfortunately Pandora isn't working right now. how to uninstall the app, reinstall the app, just to find out I had to redownload all the music that I previously had. this has been a waste of my money"
5329,Pandora,Jesse Gooding,1,11,"I got so tired of hearing ads every other song and another ad if I disliked a song, so I upgraded to pandora plus.....then I continued getting ads for pandora premium as if I never upgraded. I cancelled my subscription and weny to spotify. If I wanted to be bombareded with commercials I would just listen to FM radio."
5330,Pandora,Teri McGowan,1,0,i paid for premium and you CANNOT play whatever song you want. and could not play my playlists I had made. i am no longer using this app. i use iHeart now.
5331,Pandora,Jakob C,1,7,I'm very annoyed that I can nolonger clear the pandora music player notification in my notification bar. Force killing the app does not work either. This plus the obnoxious amounts of ads and popups in app are finally convincing me to leave pandora in favor of a better streaming service.
5332,Pandora,DevWreck Videos,5,0,please fix the bug where the app closes automatically when you try to leave it on android.
5333,Pandora,Michelle Chavez,5,1,I love it no commercials I hate talking.....less talk...more songs..yay
5334,Pandora,Treston Hadley,1,2,Get rid of the CONSTANT free trial pop ups!!!!! Its so constant and overpoweringly in your face that it just completely ruins the app. pandora used to be a beautiful thing that I used constantly. what the hell happened???

Sometimes another song would start, other times not. I followed troubleshooting instructions on the website but no change... disappointing.."

5339,Pandora,Danyelle Mohan,1,2,Don't understand why the Pandora app won't close. I hit the X from the notification bar and it just stops the music. Doesn't close out like before. Because it sits open it drains my battery. Have uninstalled and reinstalled still the same problem. Have to do a force stop just to close. Please fix.
5340,Pandora,Robby Wyatt,1,1,"After update, the icon is on my phone but says, ""not installed"" . So having to uninstall then reinstall.. again ."

5347,Pandora,Chad Weisinger,2,0,Trying to cancel my subscription. It is like pulling the last tooth from an alligator. It is such a pain. you have to go to the website and then of course it comes back with an error and states you need to do it again later. that way you forget and they can charge you for another month. make it more user friendly Pandora.
5348,Pandora,James Turnbaugh,5,0,Its really easy to just go on YouTube and find songs but I think this is just cool to have and helpful.. Its a great app I think you should get it...... Have fun!!ðŸ˜

5355,Pandora,Jonathan Wyatt,3,5,Have to close and open it a couple times at least once a day. I know I'm already on a plan I don't want to deny upgrading to next plan every other day. Find myself using YouTube more and more though I'm not a huge fan of it either. Definitely the Apple version is less glitchy than the android version.

5361,Pandora,A Google user,1,10,terrible service. too many ads. constantly asking you to try the add free feature but that requires a credit card. I would not pay for this and I'm looking for another music service that is less annoying.

5374,Pandora,A Google user,1,1,ive loved this app it has never had problems always good for quality music. premium was the way to go. until this last update now i cant even open the damn thing
5375,Pandora,A Google user,5,4,I enjoy listening to Pandora because of their gospel selections. Some updated and oldie Goldie music. Thank you. Now all I need is good old fashion church servicea. Thank you.
5376,Pandora,A Google user,2,1,"my music keeps going by really fast, it stays on one song for a second then moves to the next. I just tried uninstalling it then reinstalling it and nothing changed.

5377,Pandora,Kelly Dujmovic,1,3,"Uncaring company. Asked for them to remove the ad tailored to my ""pregnancy"", since I miscarried. I've been hearing this ad for seven months and my heart just can't take it anymore. They told me I could buy ""ad free"", but otherwise to eff off. Wow."

I am a pandora premium customer too, so this is really frustrating to not be able to use something I pay monthly for."
5384,Pandora,A Google user,1,0,"they dont even deserve a star! offline mode is a joke. ""downloaded songs"" that are always ""unavailable"" or just skip. buffers every 5 seconds. or plays 3 diffrent songs."
5385,Pandora,TheOnly BASSHEAD,5,25,have been using this as my mine music source for 8 plus years I'm still loving it and yes I have premium and have had it for 2 years it's a good perk for long drives no ads and unlimited skips

5421,Pandora,A Google user,3,0,I don't like that I ask for a specific artist and I get maybe one or two songs from that artist and then plays other artists some of which I might not even like. I ask for specific artists for a reason!!
5422,Pandora,Dallas Adams,2,3,"ive used pandora for years, free version. i have a tool station that will not play tool. its been over a month since ot played any to. ill just go use another service if you cant at least play the band im looking for once in a while. when you act like this why would anyone bother paying for your srvice?"
5423,Pandora,Kisha Melvin,5,1,I love it's music I can get on a different app and it is still on
5424,Pandora,Jayson Kingsford,1,1,"used to be great, so sad how far they have fallen. constant buffering issues have turned pandora into a nearly worthless app."
5425,Pandora,A Google user,2,18,Love the station itself but to change account information on a card or cancel it is absolutely terrible! SO hard to do. Wont be getting it back due to the inconvenience
5426,Pandora,A Google user,5,0,"if you cant do it, then im about to show you how: first you spread your legs then put your arms out and go left, right, left, right, left, right"
5427,Pandora,Blue Beal,3,3,"the songs get repetative. you can have thousands of songs on a playlist and it will only play a handful of them. also insists on suggesting artists and songs you ""dislike"" insessantly doesnt matter how many times you ""thumb down"" them. other than that its ok."
5428,Pandora,Chris Cavnar,1,10,update to app today. now it is missing. no icon. still loaded but cant find it. is the only fix to uninstall & reinstall?
5429,Pandora,Shellby Norwood,5,3,I keep having problems with it! i have a paid subscription and it wont even load on my phone! I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling and it still doesnt let me in!!
5430,Pandora,killa k,3,1,Doesn't play when I open app. Sometimes it says having difficulty. I can restart my phone and it still doesn't have sound. It may work when I change the station of music. Which is frustrating. Beginning to want to not use it at all
5431,Pandora,Kellie McGinnis,1,2,"I used to LOVE Pandora and use it regularly. l don't know if there was an update or what, but it's absolutely terrible now. And don't even get me started on trying to use it on a Smart Cast TV. The WORST."

5436,Pandora,A Google user,1,4,first off i can't listen to whateveri want when i want. second off it doesn't always download what i ask for offline listening but what really pissed me off if that i pay for this service and for thirty minutes I've been trying to listen to music and have not gotten one full song to play. YOU GOT ONE JOB PANDORA AND YOU CANT PLAY MUSIC BULLCRAP
5437,Pandora,A Google user,2,0,I like the playlists when I want to discover new music but on my phone the player wont close out after exiting my car or simply after rebooting the phone. it's a battery drain and will cause me to delete the application if the UI and software issues are not resolved. I'm not always trying to use Pandora.
5438,Pandora,Austin Smith-Ritchey,2,13,"was great until it became the most frustrating thing ever, can't even open the app, tried pretty much everything, I just wanna listen to the music I pay 10 bucks a month for"
5439,Pandora,Matt Futrell,1,10,Pandora charged my card and I canceled my subscription WAY before the trial ended. I want a refund and nowhere will it allow me to request one. I'm beyond pissed.
5440,Pandora,Meko L,4,5,I have loved you for long time! I love Premium even more! But lately (even after I did an uninstall and install) it has been cutting off repeatedly. It's annoying.
5441,Pandora,Alicia A,1,4,"Not able to use the App icon. You have to log in from the internet which is a pain. Hope this issues gets fixed soon. Honestly have Prime music, tidal, and two other but Pandora is my favorite. Hate let it go"

5443,Pandora,Jeff Nelson,1,2,pandora got rid of the quit button in the menu. so no easy way to close app. i'll probably dump the app.
5444,Pandora,A Google user,5,7,awesome and I have been a loyal listener for over 6 year's now. it's great music and variety. huge selection to choose from. Pandora Rock's!!!
5445,Pandora,Gerardo Laboy,1,2,"for months this app hasnt connected to my cars stereo, a big selling point for both my Honda and this stupid app. canceling my subscription and deleting the app. guessing by the other comments, whoever manages pandora's CRM needs to be fired."
5446,Pandora,James Mahoney,1,1,"Keeps crashing no matter what fixes I try. New phone, same issue. Galaxy S9 +."
5447,Pandora,Bookmark Mareep,4,1,While I get the need for ads when you are not a paid subscriber but I hate that I cant at least skip an add for another one or something... i don't like hearing the Adam and Eve ads pretty much almost every other ad... it seems to be the only ad I CAN'T skip....
5448,Pandora,Austin Tucker,1,0,The whole app wont let me use it. I've been subscribed for over a year and I cant log in or anything. tried uninstalling app and all! going to spotify.
5449,Pandora,Natalia Garcia,5,8,I've used pandora for several years and it always expands my music based on my likes and stations. It usually never steers me wrong and it's pretty amazing for a music lover such as myself. ðŸ’œðŸ˜ðŸ˜˜
5450,Pandora,A Google user,1,0,this app is so frustrating because I literally don't know my password and I said forgot password and it made me sigh into all these things that I don't know about. I hate this app.
5451,Pandora,Em Cee,4,0,For some reason when I try to exit out of the app I can't. i have to force stop the app each time. I thought it was my phone but I have a new one now and it's still doing the same thing.
5452,Pandora,A Google user,1,0,why did your premium subscription app stop working??? I'm paying 10 dollars a month for nothing. I cant even open your app for longer then 1 second then it shuts down. this is disappointing. I've been a premium member for pandora for years. I want this bug fixed now please
5453,Pandora,Kelly Arens,5,3,"Love Pamdora. Easy to put together playlists, play by artist or whatever. Works great with Google Voice too."

5455,Pandora,John Kelly,3,5,Pauses between songs randomly when used with android auto in Subaru Outback. Used to work perfectly. Not sure if this is Pandora or Andoid Auto issue.
5456,Pandora,A bored person is here,5,1,add more songs form other countries and the lyrics. im useing pandora because of the free premium for 39 min and idk for Spotify has this but i can find it so i havent change to spotify but its a good app over all
5457,Pandora,Melissa Tietz,4,7,"Hello, I usually love Pandora, but lately, it will start buffering through every song and I have to keep closing app and opening again to get it to start, even when I am on Wi-fi. Pls fix this bug or advise what to do."

EDIT: I got a 30 days free trial of premium, and IT WON'T DOWNLOAD MY STATIONS THAT I WANT DOWNLOADED. AND I HAVE EXCELLENT INTERNET CONNECTION. UNINSTALLED."
5461,Pandora,Bryant Hammonds,2,1,"to many problems not working properly and what Google going to do nothing but keep taking my money, not I will be canceling my subscription"
5462,Pandora,Anthony Reusch,2,0,"I like that I can look up and play pretty much whatever song I want. what I don't like is how I can't download any of my playlists to completion. I don't like how I was getting booted put every few songs or so. I don't like how when I stopped paying, everything started working again. I also don't like how the exact second I started paying again, all bugs happen again. I want my money back!"
5463,Pandora,Nelson Jules,1,7,is there something wrong with Pandora app cause it's not letting me do anything it keeps on saying that it has stop and say restart app but everytime I do that it still dose not work fix the Pandora app cause after your must recent update it has stopped working it .it stops working when I do have it working or it skips songs then it shut off by its self mid song .can Pandora app support team tell me if there a clich in the system cause this needs to be fix right away can't keep on happening
5464,Pandora,Brittany Cork,5,0,the last update is making the app icon not work!!!!! I uninstalled and reinstalled app and it fixed the problem for my phone!!
5465,Pandora,Shelly Swazey,1,0,Everytime I'm jamming to a song Pandora closes on its own. Went through all my settings and there is no way to prevent it. Very disappointed.
5466,Pandora,Leeila Sayler,2,0,5 second dove ad freezes up Pandora at 0 seconds. every time. have to get out if app and reenter just to listen to music. please fix. another thing that is messed up is sharing... can't share except by copying to clipboard. also...the new blue back round hurts my eyes bad. would you guys mind changing it please? thanks.
5467,Pandora,michele ziman,1,6,what is going on since this last update? I am paying for premium and I am not getting the services promised. I like to listen when i am driving but every 2 minutes it stops working. please fix and give me a refund for this month.
5468,Pandora,nathan herreman,4,6,why did it change? used to work great in my car with Pandora controls on the radio. Now an update and no longer works in Pandora mode. tries to start then fails. why change a good thing. contacted Pandora they say they now about new glitch but.......how about a fix or a way to roll back updates
5469,Pandora,Lawrence Rhoades,1,1,This app truly sucks. every few minutes it cuts to an ADD. If your playing from playlist it does the same thing and when you try to find where last song ended it takes from the time to next ADD. only way to cut out adds and download music is to buy the premium hince not free.
5470,Pandora,Bob Brown,3,0,Skips with Samsung Galaxy S9. After the latest Samsung update Pandora stops playing. I have to restart the app. then it randomly skips songs halfway through. Needs a big fix ASAP.
5471,Pandora,Britt Sings,1,0,I liked it when it worked.... it won't stay open for even 30 seconds now.... I'm going to cancel my subscription soon if it doesn't get fixed cuz it's a waste of money if I can't use it
5472,Pandora,Nicky Torres,2,1,Love Pandora however recently it has continued to cut off halfway thru one song. I've updated my app and even checked my setting on the app itself and my phone.
5473,Pandora,Daily Bitch,4,4,I rate Pandora 4 stars because I didn't have certain songs I hope you add all the songs like senpai by: shiki and salt by ava max and more!!!!!! (aka the 6 explanation points are nessacery)!!!
5474,Pandora,Abby Dion,3,8,"ugh, I have to sign in. I really wish there was a no sign in account. I was really excited to listen to music. If you can can you try to fix that."
5475,Pandora,Pat Sheetz,2,5,"I dont like Pandora using different versions of the same song and passing it off as the original. This happens WAY too much. Use the version of the song that made the band famous, not a crummy studio remake. The ads are also maddening."
5476,Pandora,Biggest bud ever,3,4,keeps going to offline mode when I have internet connection i have to close pandora and reload just to get offline mode off so annoying pandora needs to be updated ðŸ˜ 
5477,Pandora,Chris Squires,4,0,I have only had it for 3 weeks.. So for only the audio has bin really clear ( very crisp and very a warm in the total ? Sounds really nice.!!
5478,Pandora,A Google user,5,1,this part of the pandora is 100x better than my old account. I can actually listen to my german music. I love this version of pandora ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜
5479,Pandora,A Google user,2,3,"keep getting ads for subscription when iv been paying for it for years, half the time can't use offline mode because ""i need a subscription"" and for days it keeps saying cant play offline when im online so havent even been able to listen when im online. and it randomly changes the station. hard to use at work with appropriate music on the jobsite around kids, then kevin gates or tupac comes on."
5480,Pandora,A Google user,1,4,Dont get this app. They force you to subscribe by making it difficult to listen to music and always says buffering.
5481,Pandora,A Google user,5,0,I have to really give it a tryand pay more attention. I love music but I always listen to CD's that I chose the songs and pay to have it done. What! ðŸ˜
5482,Pandora,A Google user,1,2,will not stream through a complete song without stopping. now it wont let me cancel my subscription. very frustrated and unhappy
5483,Pandora,Landan Letcher,5,0,thanks again for your support and encouragement for the update and the kids will have a look at the place where you can find it on the website
5484,Pandora,DrZ_ SkYz,5,0,"it's great. btw, I'm not a robot or a person that is just leaving food reviews"
5485,Pandora,Nellie Kabler,3,1,always freezes and stops working on me unless i have it open and on the screen. have had problems with it for a while now.
5486,Pandora,brittany payne,1,5,"What is the point of paying for premium to enjoy offline mode... if it does not start while saying ""mode not available offline"". I mean, I am connected to the internet. idk might have to switch to spotify even though I've been using Pandora for years."
5487,Pandora,Mycalia Radcliffe,1,0,I love Panera but for the last week or two it just cant stay open and its annoying. I pay for premium so i should get what i pay for. please fix ASAP.
5488,Pandora,Dustin LaFrance,2,1,paid for the premium so i could listen offline but nearly everytime I try opening the app without service it says i need internet to open the app that that offline isnt supported??
5489,Pandora,Cynthia Dial,5,15,I Love Pandora . I especially Live how it gives me more of the category of music i like especially songs that pop up that ive never heard before & some music i hadant heard in a while
5490,Pandora,Brian Miner,3,3,It's good in aspect it's random on songs play but not as random as I would like seems to take newest songs and put priority on those before the older songs so if added like 50 songs in one go the first 25 don't seem to get played as much as the last 25.
5491,Pandora,chris steinhauer,2,1,great app when it doesn't crash all the time I even pay for premium. funny thing is this crashing never happened when I only used the free version
5492,Pandora,Anime Fan5547,3,0,"It works most of the time, but for some reason, it always cuts off! I can be in an app that is completely compatible with it, and it'll just turn off! Please help me fix this!"
5493,Pandora,A Google user,5,1,love it play what you want when you want dont get better than that
5494,Pandora,Aurora Parra,1,0,Pandora isnt playing. Pop-Up Message implies I am not connected to the internet. I am. Will rate higher once issue is resolved.
5495,Pandora,A Google user,4,0,needs less adds. maybe every 8 songs or so. then I'd be fine. and stop popping up the start trial when I just wanna listen to music.
5496,Pandora,KAY ATCHISON,5,5,"been using Pandora since 2013?, But when i pause a song app skips to the next and cant go back to replay ðŸ˜  the song , i was listening to Wish there were Unlimited skips without having to subscribe to Unlimited Version Premium, free hr uninterrupted is ok"
5497,Pandora,Andy Sayers,5,3,This is my favorite music app. After the update all you have to do is reset the icon by removing it and adding it back. That fixed the bug for me.
5498,Pandora,Kim brrrly,1,0,Always stops playing my playlist after 4 or 5 songs and goes to default stations. It's the most annoying thing ever. I took a break from Pandora because of this issue and came back and am still having this issue. Please fix this ASAP.
5499,Pandora,Nelson Kidd,1,2,googlecast fails from pixel 3XL. neither Lenovo Smart Display nor my chromecast ultra are able to play music from Pandora. other apps are working.
5500,Pandora,Nathaniel Alvarez,5,8,my experience with Pandora's absolutely amazing and something that I would like to see happen is that we have the option to download lyrics for the song that they want
5501,Pandora,Kristen Atkinson,4,1,S10+ Won't play unless connected to wifi. It just buffers but won't play. I've never had this problem before. I just got my new Samsung Galaxy S10+ on Verizon network. Is this the issue? Please fix!!!!!
5502,Pandora,Sean Kenzo,5,2,"not sure if the bug is at my end or the app. music plays and stops after 5 seconds. this starts happening after the android version update last week. my phone is Galaxy s9. i am rating 5 stars, excellent app whatsoever."
5503,Pandora,Christopher S,2,0,Would be great except it randomly starts up and playing even when the app is closed and force closed. Used to do this a lot and hadn't for a while but started back up about a week ago
5504,Pandora,James L,4,4,Love the way stations are created from artist and songs. The IU is great to use as well. My only wish is for a better sounding stream. Something of CD quality is a plan I would happily pay a premium for.
5505,Pandora,Leo Zarazua,1,27,Does not work in Mexico I traveled to Mexico on vacation and I was unable to listen to music. it kept saying that it was unavailable in this country.
5506,Pandora,ti lane,2,3,Pandora won't play offline. idk why I'm paying for it if it doesn't do what you say. yes I've checked all my settings. I want a refund. I just started a new month n I'm disappointed in this. I want music offline. I HAVE UNSUBSCRIBED.
5507,Pandora,Javier Flores,5,0,I tried to listen to my favorites station on my pandora and I cant listen to the station because if I try to start the station it wont respond when I tap it. please fix the issue at your earliest convenience
5508,Pandora,A Google user,3,1,"I've been using the app for years, and loved it. But today when I pressed it to play my station, it erased every song I downloaded and won't let me re download them. Pandora please fix this it's making me very angry."
5509,Pandora,Å Å,3,0,"100 song limit on thumbs up per station? What's up with that? I've been thumbing up certain stations for years, and you're just dumping that data? Not a good move. Upgraded to 3 stars because I'm starting to think it only *displays* the last 100 thumbs."
5510,Pandora,A Google user,3,2,Pandora is an amazing app it's just that they(the people who created it should allow u to listen to music without an account
5511,Pandora,Cindy CAMP,5,3,I can't get my google home to cast pandora premium. changed settings and it wont send me a code even though I requested it on Pandora. it said it could take a while. what's up Google? Do I need to switch to Alexa to play music in my house.
5512,Pandora,Gil Borges,4,7,"Love pandora. Have it like the first music stream service, use since they started not on portable devices but just on computers. The only thing bad is the newest version is getting stuck and wont shutdown entirely, sometimes will even start on its own. Might just be little glitch but needs fix"
5513,Pandora,daniel simons,1,1,notification tool doesnt go away after closing the app. The notification completely freezes and doesnt work once you close the app.
5514,Pandora,James Wishengrad,3,1,"Unfortunately the big now playing and music controlls in my notification center never go away. ive tried force closing, rebooting device, etc. The X at top right doesnt work but the pause and skip buttons do. This has happened repeatedly, so im finally going to uninstall and just use competitor music streaming service."
5515,Pandora,Melissa Bennett,2,0,can't use it on my ipad anymore. not supported on iPad 2. that's how i listen to the majority of my music. thank you for making spotify my go to
5516,Pandora,Carl Hesse,1,2,I've been using Pandora for about 10 years and love it. however the app requires me to go into phone settings and force stop before it minimizes on the lock screen. this used to be as simple as swiping left but that functionality no longer works.
5517,Pandora,Helena Stewart,5,0,I have been using pandora for about 9 years ?? and I love it. its is my number one music streaming app. I will never make the change to spotify. pandoras stations are better. there recommendations are better. I love it !
5518,Pandora,A Google user,5,3,Rudy Giuliani is the first president in history and the arrogant monk to have a new president and his campaign is going on a trip
5519,Pandora,Chris Y,1,1,"Dumpster fire. Always buffering, never works with either of my cars (different makes). This is ever since SiriusXM took over. Switching to another program and probably dumping SiriusXM. Also, dont give me that canned response because it is garbage after seeing other reviews."
5520,Pandora,A Google user,1,0,"between the amount of ads and having to restart your phone to get the app to stop freezing, about 1/20th of your time will be spent actually listening to music."
5521,Pandora,Buddah Felix,5,4,I love pandora. however tho it would be nice to allow the paid users to have more than 1 person using their pandora. I pay for it plus I have my stuff signed in on different Alexa's so if my daughter at home is listening to music I can't at work. that sucks
5522,Pandora,Lisa Holbrook,2,3,normally have no issues with this app. I love listening to Pandora....but when played for like 2 hours straight it will start cutting out during songs and have to close app and restart... all for it to do again its getting aggravating and I'm bout ready to say the heck with the app. Needs to be fixed soon
5523,Pandora,Shilena Wilson,1,0,Pandora was fine before this update and now it just cuts off in the car and I have to start it again. I have premium but I am canceling it and going to Amazon music. If I'm paying I expect ot to work. and don't say it's my phone cause I have a BRAND NEW note 9.
5524,Pandora,A Google user,2,0,"The app keeps crashing about 15 seconds into a song. Its really annoying. I cant seem to get it to work. (Might switch to Spotify) :( Arent updates supposed to make the app new and improved? To me, this update made the app new and ""I disapprove."""
5525,Pandora,Kaylynn Mulvaney,5,4,it lets you have your stations played anytime of the day and if you go to your profile the songs that youve updated stay there and you can play them like a muaic list
5526,Pandora,D Ha,5,1,"very happy with Pandora, plays all of my favorite music and artists. thank you! Pandora!"
5527,Pandora,A Google user,1,0,They charge you without giving you a direct way to cancel subscription. Says go to p. Com and there is nowhere to do this. Rip off
5528,Pandora,Josiah Miranda,5,3,can you fix the issue that when you share a song and copy the link and send it that it opens to the song right now it just opens pandora. love this app tho just an issue I've noticed lately.

5535,Pandora,brando midkiff,5,4,"After almost a decade, Pandora has come to know my routine and sense abnormalities in the alignment of my chakra. This results in perfect, one of a kind playlists... and this applies to every last station. bravo, pandora... bravo"
5536,Pandora,A Google user,1,2,I couldn't even get into the app because it has ridiculous login stuff that keeps saying:SORRY THE PASSWORD YOU ENTERED WAS INCORRECT. I'm not trying to be mean but I just can't get into the app because of this. So I will need to find something else.
5537,Pandora,Jacqueline Cuevas,1,2,what in the world has happened?? this used to be my to go to for music and lately it crashes on every song.!!! it needs fixed or I'm going somewhere else like spotify.

Also my music kept on cutting out I thought it was my head phones so I got new ones but I kept happening so then I thought it was my data but it happens on my Wi-Fi too.

6069,Pandora,Jasmine Brewer,1,0,poor station creation altogether. very repetitive. tons of ads. eventually veers to unrelated choice of music
6070,Pandora,Brittany Davis,3,1,update is horrible. I hate that you can't choose which stations YOU WANT to shuffle anymore and you cant exit without shutting the whole app down now!!!
6071,Pandora,Typhany Williams,1,1,Not worth 10 dollars a month to be able to look up songs and with the 5 dollar upgrade you have to watch an ad to search a song. going to get ride of this app.
6072,Pandora,Angel Foulke,2,1,songs are skipping like a scratched CD!!! other then that great songs
6073,Pandora,robert donohue,5,2,I really enjoy this music app. Simple enough to use even while driving.
6074,Pandora,rr_ 0237,5,2,If you want were you can pick your own music to listen to its pandora. Pandora is better than Spotifi because if you pick a song for example sicko mode on spotifi it playes another song and its not the song you want and you have to pay for the song you want to listen to and Pandora is different because if you pick a song it playes ONLY that song not ANOTHER song :)
6075,Pandora,A Google user,5,5,If you choose carefully over time you can have a great AI DJ. Patience and hack/game.
6076,Pandora,Johnny Lane,5,0,Its great I listen to music almost every second I am awake.Love Pandora.
6077,Pandora,FatalAGamer90,4,9,U see this app is cool but the thing I don't like is the ads before u start u first song. This app otherwise is probably second best behind Spotify (only if u have premium on Spotify)
6078,Pandora,Kelly Johnson,5,8,I like it because it has all the stuff I want to listen to I just love Pandora but I don't like the adds and waiting to get more skips that's just dum
6079,Pandora,Trent Ackerson,1,1,pos app wont stay open. paying for premium and getting nothing. gonna cancel.

6081,Pandora,Frankie Hardin,1,15,false advertisement (pandora plus) is NOT unlimited skips. Don't be fooled

6087,Pandora,A Google user,5,11,I think it is good because you get to pick your song and you can turn off your phone and listen to the music still unlike other music apps.
6088,Pandora,Janice P.,1,2,whatever you did reverse it b/c i cant find the app on home screen and now it plays 1 song then cuts off in my car with bluetooth connection and i have to open the app again it will cut off saying not able to to provide. fix the bug!
6089,Pandora,leave me alone I probably don't care anyways,1,0,you have to pay so you can download music if you dont pay then you need to use wi-fi or data would not recomend
6090,Pandora,Dallin C,5,0,I love the premium version! The one thing I really want Pandora to have is searching music features like four-on-the-floor and house roots.
6091,Pandora,mary mary,4,0,Good app even with ads. Jus wish there was a quite app not just sign out. If you pause the music and come back later it difficult to get the station playing again.
6092,Pandora,Jessica James,3,2,App used to work excellently but about 2 days ago it berry l began to crash every time I tried to use it. I pay for premium and this is getting out of hand

6105,Pandora,Scott Dolinger,2,3,"your latest update sucked, I have to go to the Playstore each time to open the app. Please fix this, quite annoying. Spotify looking better and better....."
6106,Pandora,Tom Davis,5,2,I love Pandora I can listen to what I want
6107,Pandora,victoria hensley,1,0,im starting to hate this app because i have had it for years now and now it wont let me into the app unless i go to google play and click open
6108,Pandora,A Google user,5,3,because I gave it five stars is because you can turn it off or go in the game I'm going to game more like you YouTube and it stays on that's why so I'm going to be playing a game with the music to get a state on and I want the pic music* farts *
6109,Pandora,Maria Long,1,1,Won't save my songs in my collection 90% of the time since the update. Why am I paying for a subscription if it isn't working properly?? Please fix.

6964,Pandora,Megan Bussell,1,1,I have a note 8 and I'm on the family plan and for about a month now I have been getting an error that tells me to contact support. I have tried that and they told me that they'd work on it but wouldnt let me know when it was fixed. I do not get how the only way to communicate with this company is through email and then when you have an issue they will work on it but not let you know. I also lost my play list because of this error so I am not thrilled with them right now....
6965,Pandora,Spicy Lemon keeper,4,0,HOW DO I UNLIKE A SONG ONCE I'VE LIKED IT AND CLEARED THE APP

6968,Pandora,A Google user,1,23,"I can't skip in android auto. It loads infinitely on that station after a skip, and has been playing the same songs for a week. To anyone experiencing the same issue; there's a way around it by putting another station in the same state, then switching back to the station you wanna listen to. It will play a new song on that station. Will update when this issued is resolved."
6969,Pandora,Marie Moon,5,3,i love it i just wish you made it for off line
6970,Pandora,A Google user,5,0,Better then Spotify because I added songs in Spotify but it played different songs from the one I wanted ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘

6979,Pandora,Kimberly Dome,1,23,It has been closing out and I'm not able to listen to music at all. Since the last updates this has been happening. This is so aggravating. Want to charge people a monthly fee but don't want to fix the issues. This sucks. I'm cancelling my subscribtion. I have had this and been paying for several years now.
6980,Pandora,A Google user,1,3,"Love the music, but the technology frequently fails, and then there's the fact that even though I paid for the premium service (loved it when it worked), after 3 weeks, I could not access my account. Pandora was nonresponsive to my inquiries, and then I was billed again. Google is good about taking my money. Pandora tech support seems nonexistent."

6995,Pandora,boo davalos,5,1,"'PANDORA MUSIC"" Is absolutely the best music app around. The music selection is magnificent and I love the fact that we can make and name our own radio stations and playlists. You'll find that there are so many exciting things that you can do in this app. Too many to name here. I highly recommend this app. If you love music, you'll love ""PANDORA MUSIC"". ""5 - STAR"" rating !!"
6996,Pandora,Conner Moore,5,3,Sounds so much better than spotify! Thanks!
6997,Pandora,A Google user,1,0,pandora worked great until recently. none of my music seems to play... very frustrating.
6998,Pandora,A Google user,4,3,its very relaxin you can just sit back and relax why you can enjoy your favorite songs
6999,Pandora,Casey Purta,1,117,"Only Pandora FREE is good for music discovery. I've used pandora free for over 10 years. I finally bought premium. It doesn't support split-screen or multi- window, nor does it have a driving- mode. It doesn't work in other countries. The PAID version has less discovery options than the free version and its ""browse"" tab only shows top 40 or other BS that is not curated/adjusted to your listening history. THIS APP IS DEAD."

7006,Pandora,Kiersten Shelton,5,0,I enjoyed to play music on Pandora I love to listen to music
7007,Pandora,Michelle Tamez,5,1,I use Pandora regularly and love the variety of music I get to learn about and enjoy. Would highly recommend! An idea for improvement: often I am not looking at the screen when listening but would love to know the artist I'm listening to - could there be an option that you can turn on/off to have it announce the artist at the start of the song? does anybody else think this is a great idea?? Thanks!
7008,Pandora,Dalton Hoffman,2,3,i like the app but I wish there was a feature where you can choose to download the whole song before listening. It's really bad with poor data connections to listen to 30 seconds of a song only to have to wait for it to buffer for another 30 seconds. I also have a google pixel 3 and sometimes Pandora will automatically open and will not close; I have to go to my settings to force stop the app every time. Fix this for a Google Pixel 3 and I will gladly give 5 stars.
7009,Pandora,Martin Klein,2,3,"The algorithm they use is awesome. I've discovered a lot of great new music but... the user interface stinks, some basic function are too difficult for me to find (assuming they exist) and now it appears I'll have to uninstall/reinstall it just to get it to run on my phone after the last update. 5 stars if they would just put a little effort into the user interface."
7010,Pandora,A Google user,5,1,Best app for finding artists based on songs played.
7011,Pandora,music mitch,2,0,it was nice to have when it worked but for me the app kept on crashing

7015,Pandora,MONICIA RESOR,1,2,it keep stopping in the middle of the music.
7016,Pandora,Dave Slomer,1,1,"Pandora plays great music and was free, until a month ago. But $4.99 for better options and no commercials was okay--just drop Sirius; save money. But now at $9.99 for same service as a few days ago, I'm dropping it. And Sirius, which largely stinks anyway. Save about, $25/month. Go to Slacker, for instance. If people like me drop both of Sirius' services, I hope there's a stampede that makes them go under. Really rotten deal from the get-go."
7017,Pandora,Tommy Earnhardt,5,1,very good and awesome music!!!!
7018,Pandora,Jim Kidd,1,2,"Great selection of music and Android auto integration is awesome. However, the notification constantly on the screen and not being able to get rid of it drives me insane. Also drains my battery since it's needlessly always running. This is a critical fix for me to install again, but the issue is well documented as being ignored by Pandora... shame."
7019,Pandora,Aaron Brewer,4,24,"I love the app. My only complaint is that I wish it was on more peripherals. I had a Ticwatch Pro (Wear OS), and I loved that I could control my choice of music at work by not even picking up my phone. Now I have the Samsung Galaxy watch, and I'm a little disappointed to find that it's not available on this watch. It would be great if y'all could work on that."
7020,Pandora,Sarah Welch,3,2,its buffering downloaded music and wont play songs that i want it too

(when you voice search a song... 80% of the time you'll get the dumbest version of the song you were looking for, like a remix, cover, live recording, or acoustic version....ANYTHING but the actual studio version, even though it's in Pandora's library plain as day)... UI incredibly behind the times. I chose Pandora as my ""free"" premium service with my latest AT&T plan. I wish I could change my mind. I rather pay $10 to Spotify per month."
7030,Pandora,Caesar,1,4,"been using Pandora for years and loved it, but a recent update has made it impossible to skip a song on android auto (2018 Audi RS3) with my Samsung Galaxy S9+.

7036,Pandora,Riley Ghramm,1,0,"This was great at first, until ads were after every song, I was unable to skip more than a few tracks, pop ups every time I attempted to change a station or setting, and constant urging to upgrade to premium. I uninstalled it and turned on the radio. Unlimited skips, random good songs, no pop ups, and no urging me to spend money, they actually offer to give away money! I have no idea how Pandora even exists still, they moved backwards in the progression of technology! I may try Spotify."

7042,Pandora,A Google user,5,2,"I have pandora on headphones or other bluetooth or hardwire devices most of the day, especially if I am doing a project in the house, shoveling snow or working in the yard. Pandora helps me get through the day and night. resently I lost my blutooth function, as well as my access to pandora. i had allowed an update that disable alot of my app data. I didn't realize how much having Pandora in my ear helped me get through the day, stay on task and staying relaxed through frustrating moments."
7043,Pandora,r wilcots,3,1,New update is not closing Pandora when you x out of the music. The music stops but it keeps running.
7044,Pandora,Larry Morrison,1,1,yeah recently Pandora has been eating my battery and all my data even when it's off so this is been going on for 2-3 months now and I just now discovered on my phone is a thing that says talks about data usage and battery use and that just came on today so I've been unable to do anything with my phone because it's always buffering because my data usage has been eaten up by this f****** Pandora f****** pisses me off so now I've had to uninstall it and I love Pandora

7063,Pandora,Chasten Richard,4,1,"alright I just got Pandora premium and it's cool and all but one simple thing yall need to fix is the queue song button, if I'm able to listen to a song without copyright issues and I want to queue it that means I want to play immediately next, regardless if I'm listening to a playlist or station. Sometimes it seems it works but most times it doesn't. Fix this and this app will be worth 5 stars"

7067,Pandora,Norma Navarro,5,0,IT HAS THE MUSIC I LIKE FROM BACK IN THOSE DAYS
7068,Pandora,Phillip Hyatt,3,2,i really do appreciate having Pandora and the benefits of unlimited music but i pay for a subscription and they constantly harass me by the upgrade to premium message that pops up each and every single time i back out to change a station. i think the price is fair for what i have and pay for but that it repeats songs way too much and too soon. its sometimes like having the exact same playlist each day unless i change the station. and thats not even all i dont have enough room left here...
7069,Pandora,A Google user,1,11,constant buffering. Constant. Im a premium subscriber and i have to keep deleting my data to get the buffering to stop. I have to start all over. Buffering is not why i like listening to music. Its worse then a scratched cd. Its a issue that should be resolved and overly compensated fully by pandora. Its the same as willingly selling scratched cds and saying their new. A constant buffering pandora premium is not what i paid for. I spend more time in the settings app then i do listening to music.
7070,Pandora,Kameisha Rice,3,2,"Ive had pandora almost 7 years now and honestly im starting to hate it because my app doesnt stay open for no longer than 30 minutes and then will shut down. You can even have another app open while playing it. Quality has gotten worse. Ive also notice that some artist stations dont get updated even though they still make music. I like old songs but what to be involved in new music too. For example, if I have Maroon 5 station on it will only play songs from years ago. Fix the bugs and ill re-rate"
7071,Pandora,Amy Hiatt,3,18,It's going downhill. I have been a loyal Pandora fan and user for 12 years purely because they never changed from what I liked and always played a variety of music. More and more often I am hearing the same songs over and over. Their definition of variety is narrowing to the same 15 song loop the local stations do. And now they've got all the extra junk that gets in the way of my music. I don't need podcasts or collections or favorites. I just need my music!!!!!!
7072,Pandora,A Google user,5,0,pandora he is so good I need it all the time on my phone thank you

IT'S A WASTE! I'm uninstalling.

7090,Pandora,Ramon Scurry,2,39,"App is getting worse. Stations do not play similar music most of the time. I have this one for The Black Keys. half the time it's either pop culture garbage ""alternative"" music. Like where is the ""I don't listen to garbage, lacking lyrical depth music"" button. Same with rap stations garbage ass wanna be thugs and ballers music does not relate to Logic. Dude is a genius and yet is related to trash. Your service sucks I have already cancelled my paid subscription and will just find some better way."
7091,Pandora,James Morgan,3,3,"I'm fine with the ads, though it's not like everyone couldn't live without them. What I'm not fine with is the fact that the app can't transition to an ad or transition from an ad without being the active app. Phone locked and want to listen to music? Perfect!... until an ad tries to start."
7092,Pandora,A Google user,1,0,"I was ok with Pandora until they started playing commercials in spanish. now its driven me to leave a comment and switch to using spotify. i would never pay for AGAIN, no matter how much you attempt to annoy me. its not worth it, you still just play the same songs over and over and all you end up paying for is no commercials. NOT WORTH IT."

7122,Pandora,syd reinarz,4,1,My screen app has quit working. please fix this glitch.
7123,Pandora,Dreamy MÃ¸Ã¸n,5,0,Its better then spotify in my opinon because it doesnt have much ads.
7124,Pandora,A Google user,1,2,"it was a lazy exuse for a music app, when I'm in the middle of a song it will just change it. yet, radio doesn't do that, I want is to listen to my music,but that is too hard to ask for. Then,when I was sighing up it asks me for my zip code, how is that important for music ?"
7125,Pandora,Gaz3rman,1,3,This is a good music app though I'm disappointed with the app. If you pause the music after switching to a different app (I use the calculator quite often) or it was forced to pause (phone calls are a prime example) the app will force close itself forcing you to restart the app every single time.
7126,Pandora,Thomas Bruecker,1,8,"Auto plays constantly when connecting to to bluetooth, usb and Android Auto. Even after turning off all autoplay features it still forces itself open. Makes using phone difficult when I must constantly keep Pandora under control. Best way to fix the problem is to uninstall the app. Spotify, IHeart Radio, and numerous other streaming apps do not have this issue."
7127,Pandora,Ciera Austin,1,7,"I pay for pandora premium monthly and as of recent my app hasnt been working properly. I've reached out to pandora over a week ago via email and the problem has yet to be fixed. I'm going to have cancel my membership, I'm very disappointed. I've had pandora for years!"
7128,Pandora,kyle may,1,0,with this new update pandora wont connect at all even when im connected to any wifi.
7129,Pandora,A Google user,1,0,"Charging me $10/ mo only to cut off mid song every time, no thanks goodbye pandora"
7130,Pandora,A Google user,2,1,"Randomly shuts down in the middle of the fourth or fifth song. Ads are getting worse. They play between every song now, sometimes two in a row. I had to give it a fake zip code because they try to be all creepy and have personalized advertising. Stop being creepy, Pandora."
7131,Pandora,Estavon Posey,5,1,lost title and artist information. it does not appear on the auto media screen.
7132,Pandora,Jon Kessler,5,1,"love it, so easy to use!!!"
7133,Pandora,Victor Martinez,5,0,Pandora is my #1 music choice of streaming. thank you Pandora. ðŸ’™ðŸ¤—
7134,Pandora,Janice Dawson,5,1,Like the choices of music
7135,Pandora,belleia rivers,1,0,why does it keep stopping & it won't install
7136,Pandora,Sandra Davis,5,0,personal and fun to make your own
7137,Pandora,Chris Cabitto,2,18,"Lost Android Auto Functionality. Im just echoing what I see others have said. Sunce the update Android Auto is basically unusable. Works for one song then freezes when you change stations or skip. Change the station again and it works, next change it freezes. I drive for work so I use Android Auto pretty much daily. Without that functionality the app is useless to me, which stinks because I much prefer the interface over Spotify or Amazon Music."
7138,Pandora,Mitchell Miller,5,0,Great Music App for the whole family!!!
7139,Pandora,A Google user,5,21,i don't really have anything to say but this is the BEST APP EVER
7140,Pandora,Jacob Blanton,1,0,i got pandora premium and ever since it pauses to laod the song 3 or 4 times before it finishes
7141,Pandora,Andresa Niesen,5,2,good doesnt use much internet so it works on slow internet
7142,Pandora,tom scott,5,0,love this app I use it all the time when riding my Harley
7143,Pandora,Helene Davis,4,1,I love listening to Pandora in my car.
7144,Pandora,Jane Goethel,1,1,this sucks. you cant play half of the albums. you can keep it.
7145,Pandora,KimShon Ridgell,5,1,I love having my music and my fingertips
7146,Pandora,Tracy Martin,1,0,watch what you pay for they'll gladly sell short on their agreement!
7147,Pandora,Kaylee Fleenor,1,0,I am not about to keep paying for a subscription like I have for years if all it's going to do is crash any time I turn it on
7148,Pandora,Justin M.,5,19,"Great! I have really enjoyed Pandora since I got the app. I recently ran into some issues where songs would not download, and nothing I did fixed the situation, so I left a negative review. Pandora was in touch with me within a day or so, and I was able to completely fix the issue. Great app, great customer service."
7149,Pandora,Jesse Oswalt,2,2,"Used to be a great experience, I've been paying for premium for a good while. However fairly recently it started regularly purging your offline music and puts great strain on your data limits in the process. They may fix it eventually but I might be cancelling just to save my data and cash."
7150,Pandora,Nick Watt,1,1,completely frustrating needs updated or somthing. app stops after every song and dosnt start playing until I just touch the screen. some songs just randomly stop and change to the songs or just pause for no reason again until I touch the screen and it starts the next song. super frustrating wish I could find another music player because this one is broke. messaged them on Facebook and got no help.
7151,Pandora,Tenrosei Xeroexp,3,2,Its a great app for discovering new music similar to music you like. However the app is a pain to try and close once it decides to stay in your notification bar. And when playing through android auto it gets stuck loading next song occassionally you have to close the app and restart it to get it to work.
7152,Pandora,A Google user,5,1,great music to listen from all over the world
7153,Pandora,Vincent Mirelez,3,1,Was working fine until shortly before the latest update. plays half of one song then app restarts.
7154,Pandora,Jose Ayala,5,1,"BEEN LISTENING TO PANDORA FOR OVER 8 + YEARS,THE BEST MUSIC & ALWAYS MY KIND,LOVE IT... THANK YOU GUYS"
7155,Pandora,Shannon kerrigan,5,0,its great for when your doing somthing and u want to listen to music
7156,Pandora,Jazmin Gonzalez,1,0,has been stopping every time i minimize to go to another app or when lock my screen
7157,Pandora,Michael Hill,1,16,Used to like this app but it has tons of bugs. It locks up either when you try to skip a song or will lock up randomly. Seems to lock up perhaps when trying to load an advertisement. Uninstalling this and glad in stopped paying for the version with no ads. Google music works great compared to this.
7158,Pandora,Tammy taggart,1,1,ðŸ˜¡ it would be nice if you would send more than the same freaking password. Because sometimes you can't tell what the letter or number is... and the sign in tells you over and over wrong sign in information. but that's fine... I don't have to use your app... bye bye...
7159,Pandora,Kasandra Hagler,2,1,"used to be my favorite music app but now its like no matter the station , its like the same 5 songs play . I understand theres a "" im tired of this track"" option but im only tired because if i open the app at 12 ill hear the same songs when i close and open again at 1:30 its the same song . Definitely will be the reason i delete this app and ive been a user for years."
7160,Pandora,Steven Lyttle,5,1,I really appreciate y'alls music . I jam as i pump weights ðŸ˜‚
7161,Pandora,jo thompson,1,7,i will give you 5 stars when you fix the off line storage(ols) problem . the app is on the SD(64G high speed)@2% butt the ols. is internal and will not be mooved (8G@98%). 20 song's max and phone cant update and crashing all the time. that sucks on long trips cancelling subscription end of month unless fixed sincerely soon to be X fan PS or BS why pay for that and it isn't the phone we have 6 different ones all with same problem. plus there are 100s of same problem on line
7162,Pandora,Moises Hinojos,2,1,there is something wrong with the app. it keeps opening up on my notifications bar without a radio station it just says unknown. I have uninstalled and reinstalled and even switched devices and still the same issue which drains my battery life. I don't believe I'll be keeping it anymore
7163,Pandora,A Google user,5,0,great app but after like 15 minutes it turns off and my alarm for the app is off
7164,Pandora,A Google user,5,1,it a lot of information I don't know What to say I just like music but l don't have no money right now

I love the music, just not the shutting down in the middle so much that I can't even enjoy it. please fix this as I have the ZTE Blade ZMax. thanks"
7171,Pandora,Daniel Moores,1,1,keeps shutting g down. i pay a premium charge as well
7172,Pandora,Ian Neri,1,14,can someone tell me what error code 99001 means because it keeps popping up in my pandora
7173,Pandora,Kiara Liddle,1,3,"Pandora used to be my main app. I even paid for the premium. which was great. until a glitch happened and now it won't even let me in the app, because it states that I dont have connection.. I have full bars, the WIFI strength is excellent.. but it still wont let me in.."
7174,Pandora,A Google user,5,4,best music app i ever had and very easy to use
7175,Pandora,Margaret Williams,5,2,love music and you have what I like best.
7176,Pandora,Gary Simpson,1,1,Ever since it updated all it's done is buffer. i have to uninstall and reinstall it to get it to work until i exit it then have to repeat everything. I have had pandora for years they need to fix the problem i have now deleted the app since its just a waste of space on my phone.
7177,Pandora,Kenya Patterson,3,0,it's a good app most of the time but it always buffers and freezing
7178,Pandora,Joseph Kocour,2,1,"App no longer closes even with the pull down ""X"" always have to force stop it."
7179,Pandora,Israel Peralta,1,0,the app keeps starting up after i close it or even when i pause it honestly tired of it
7180,Pandora,Peto Santucho,4,3,i love it. great way to hear new music
7181,Pandora,Maggie Montenegro,4,0,"I love the ease of app & ability to customize my music listening preferences. But, I gave 4 stars because a lot of remixes are popping up as songs I've liked (I normally don't like remixes). If I like a certain song, I expect that to play, not a remix in it's place that isn't even showing as a remix in the song title. Remixes should be labeled as such so people have the option of giving it a thumbs down without missing out on the original that they actually want to hear."
7182,Pandora,Blake,1,0,"music starts playing automatically when the app is launched, weather I'm connected to Bluetooth it not, it'll just start playing out of my phone speakers. there is no reason for that at all. i tried reinstalling the app, but it still does it, and i dont see an option to shut that off. going back to Spotify if this is not fixed by the end of my free trial. i really like your app better than the Spotify one, but this is a deal breaker"
7183,Pandora,Jereidiah Symonette,5,0,i just got this app because many people were teling me about it and its the best
7184,Pandora,Ken Barnes,3,0,"After many years I bit the bullet and bought premium. It is, by and large, worth it. However, the android app is buggy. It persists on running when backing out of the program and requires pulling down notifications to terminate it. Worst of all it just doesn't work well with chromecast. It plays normally for about 5 minutes and then just stops. 2 minutes later it starts playing through the phones speaker. Since I've spent a fair amount of money on CC this will probably be a deal breaker."
7185,Pandora,A Google user,5,8,it has a song for every mood no matter what
7186,Pandora,A Google user,1,1,Stops in the middle of a song to play ads then skips the song completely. Switching to Spotify.
7187,Pandora,Danny Servin,5,0,"PANDORA PREMIUM IS AWESOME, I CAN REALLY HERE MY MUSIC CLEARLY!!"
7188,Pandora,purple girl,3,0,i love it but i hate i haft to see a commercial when I'm gonna here music can you please stop with the commercial it's getting annoying love the app thought
7189,Pandora,Andrea Perez,1,0,recenr update doesn't allow you to close pandora it stays open in the background
7190,Pandora,Ronald Terrell,5,3,Great music with a variety stations that you enjoy absolutely free!
7191,Pandora,Faith Charm,4,1,i like it you should too lol
7192,Pandora,A Google user,1,99,"Still.... Complete disrespect for the notification settings. I disabled ALL notifications including the auto launch on Bluetooth connection, yet the app still appears in my notification bar and I cannot dismiss it. Force closing the app is only temporary The only way to have it respect my settings is to uninstall. Goodbye Pandora."
7193,Pandora,Flozel Marriott,5,0,love the new features of replaying your favorite songs.
7194,Pandora,Jonathan Hensley,4,0,its great for listening to your music when playing other games
7195,Pandora,A Google user,1,0,this app worked fone for yesrs and now all it will do is buffer unless im on wifi!
7196,Pandora,Lashonda Denise Howard,5,5,I had this app for a very long time I have too hook my account back up to here my fiance got his togather. This is grear
7197,Pandora,Gary Mollet,5,1,it has every song I have ever looked for and so simple to use my 7yr figured out how to listen to it
7198,Pandora,Mariana Caballero,4,1,its amazing because u can search up songs and play them without ads but when u go back to your normal radio there are so many ads u have to watch
7199,Pandora,Lisa Montano,1,1,it wont let me download!!!ðŸ˜ˆðŸ˜ˆðŸ˜ˆðŸ˜ˆ

7202,Pandora,A Google user,4,3,"Every time i tey to open the app it says that uts not available in this country (i live in the U.S.), i click on ""ok"" then the app closes. I keep trying to reopen it and even uninstall it then reinstall it, i tried turning off my phone too, but it wont open. What's uo with that?"
7203,Pandora,Kimberly Wax,1,0,"I have used Pandora for several years, but today I am done. I just heard their Pandora advertisement, which stated 'maybe you need to find your let's get naked song'. In an over-sexualized world, usually violating women, this is repulsive and shows a lack of business ethics. Friends have suggested another app., which I will now download. Pandora just lost a customer."
7204,Pandora,Robert Jeter,1,1,What is going on i can't get all of my music
7205,Pandora,A Google user,4,0,I like listing to Pandora cause I can listen to the music I like

7207,Pandora,Tylor Wright,1,0,I HATE IT IT WONT LET ME SIGN IN AND I KNOW THTS MY RIGHT INFORMATION IT DOESNT LET ME
7208,Pandora,Clint Maxwell,2,0,"I used the free version for years and recently switched to the premium. I like being able to set up my own playlist and only had a few songs I could not add. It was what I was looking for. However, and this is close to being the ender for me, I constantly get the ""We're having unexpected technical difficulties"" message. I had to redownload the app last week because it was stuck in offline mode and would not load. I'm close to moving on to another music provider."
7209,Pandora,Koffin Master,2,0,"Great on the music side of things, but the amount of ads has gotten beyond out of control. If I wanted to hear that many ads I would put on the radio. There are sometimes ads in the middle of the song. It's like they are playing as many ads as songs just to force you to upgrade to a paid service. Why do that when there are other truly free listening aps with better features. Sorry Pandora, I've had an account since your infancy, but that's the reality of how a long time user feels."
7210,Pandora,annie noneya,3,0,"I'm only giving 3 stars because it's constantly closing on me for no reason! I got a 14-days free of premium for having it for 4 years and couldn't even use it most of the time because of the app closing & not opening back up, no matter how many times i try! I'm definitely not going to pay for the premium as long as it keeps doing that. I really love this app and wish this issue would get fixed and then I'd changed it to 5 stars and give premium another chance..."
7211,Pandora,A Google user,1,0,"the like feature doesn't mean your favs will be played more. I use all my skips the first 10 minutes I am in the car and I have been using the app for over a year. it just picks awful songs. it also freezes everytime I skip or switch channels. so I have to skip and it freezes, then I switch the channel and it works. or I switch a channel, and it freezes and then I switch again and it works. GARBAGE. WHY ON EARTH WOULD ANYONE PAY FOR PREMIUM"
7212,Pandora,Michael Cabrera,1,0,App keeps crashing. Paid user for a awhile and pretty frustrated.
7213,Pandora,Brian Sloan,4,1,great it turned me on to a lot of new music

7215,Pandora,Adam Finkbeiner,1,0,pandora is glitching on Samsung s9+ plays for about 15-45 seconds then shuts off.
7216,Pandora,Brandy Sneider-Koontz,2,0,I've been using the peaceful and rain sounds stations for my baby to sleep. Why do the commercials have to be busting your speakers loud? The commercials ten times louder then the music. Like that's ridiculous. Thought using those stations would help her sleep but it just wakes her up when a commercial comes on.
7217,Pandora,Cody O__o,4,2,I love using Pandora but the stations always drift away from the artist I was hoping to focus on.
7218,Pandora,Chris Fleming,5,0,I love the app. I use it every time I'm in my car and all the time at home.

7225,Pandora,Jeremiah Frost,5,2,I control the music I listen to!!
7226,Pandora,Diamond Doyle,2,12,A year ago I could look up pretty much any song and it would play. I decided I listened enough to pay for the removal of the ads. BUT none of my downloaded/liked songs play anymore. I'm over this app. ðŸ˜¶ðŸ¤”ðŸ˜‘ too many copyright issues
7227,Pandora,Laura Keeper,4,0,"im gonna give it a good rating because it worked pretty well but after a while whenever i opened it, it would just say ""sorry Pandora is not available in this country"" i live in the US in Indiana. I uninstalled then reinstalled it and it worked for a few more days before giving me the same notification. please fix this as i really do enjoy the app"
7228,Pandora,Jason Holmes,3,1,"Im a paying customer, but the app seems to act up when trying to download playlist for offline play. ive uninstalled, purged the storage locally but nothing downloads. it just shows the double green arrow icon on the playlist showing its downloaded. toggling it back and forth doesn't help either."
7229,Pandora,scott Underwood,4,0,"Pandora has always been an easy to use provider for finding music and other artists similair to your favirites. Unfortunately this app, particularly with recent updates, has begun openning on it's own and running in the background. It will do it multiple times a day. I have found that nearly every time i turn my screen off, when I pick it back up Pandora is running in the background. 15, Feb 19 Update No change. App starts itself and run in the background. Uses about 25% of my daily battery."
7230,Pandora,Steven Williams,2,0,An incredible app that took a hard turn into over advertising. I think I heard three ads back to back after 2 songs. Ive been using Pandora since it's inception and have dozens of stations and this happening was enough to get me to delete the app. I already pay for Spotify and this free version of Pandora is no longer worth the space on my phone. Goodbye old friend. I hope you see better days.
7231,Pandora,Sam Huskins,1,0,"same problem as others, paying for premium, app is not staying open long, please fix soon or will be cancelling"
7232,Pandora,Zainab Jamaluddin,2,2,"Updates made it crash like crazy, it worked perfectly fine before the last few updates now, within some time as the app runs in the background it crashes. please fix this problem and ill change my review. i really enjoy this app but this is really frustrating."

7243,Pandora,A Google user,1,1,hate this app too many ads stop ads it ruins listening to music
7244,Pandora,Terrilyn Cormier,1,0,"DO NOT INSTALL THIS APP. There is a hidden agenda with the creators/developers. the app turns on gps. after I turn off gps, it forces it back on. it can record audio and listen to you. why does it need to know my exact location. why does it need access to my contacts and need permission to delete them? DO NOT INSTALL THIS APP!"

7260,Pandora,Wyatt Grenier,4,0,"Almost perfect except for 4 thing for me: 1- Pandora doesn't have all the music thats available on the market. 2- the rising cost for Pandora 1. 3- the commercial if you don't pay for Pandora 1. 4- this last one is a hard one to describe because it deals with the selection of songs that Pandora's search engine uses to match music you've liked and no way to refine your preferred type of music with say like instruments preference, vocal type not just in generic categories like ""hip hop""."
7261,Pandora,A Google user,5,0,just started listing to it love it just gotta figerout how to get to what i wanna lissen to
7262,Pandora,Mitchel Shepherd,4,1,"Thus music app works great if you pay the 9.99 a month. without the sub you get overly bombarded with ads and the amount of skips given is worthless. If you have the sub, the app is great. 4/5 mainly because it forces you to pay to properly enjoy your music."

I get error messages saying the station isn't available or that they can't play Pandora right now or it just buffers. I've been putting up with it for months and I'm so frustrated. I've been a loyal Pandora listener since the very beginning but I'm paying for a product and a service and I'm not getting what I paid for. If its not better by April I'm going to have to switch so I don't keep wasting money.
7269,Pandora,A Google user,4,0,Seems to be very good. Is app. extra?

7273,Pandora,Quinn Muldoon,1,0,All I want to do is listen to a certain band on THEIR station and it just wont play them for the life of me. Its honestly annoying and ruins what would otherwise be a solid app. You know if you don't mind five ads per song. Its disappointing because this could have been a good app if it just played band that we wanted to listen too then it would work but you might as well just search the band up on YouTube it's pointless.
7274,Pandora,Kevin Moran,1,2,"Love the app, Hate the most recent update..... The latest Pandora update interferes with ability to change stations or next songs through Andriod Auto.  The Pandora App via  Andriod Auto just gets stuck on a ""loading"" status.  It occurs with my Pixel 2 connected to my Andriod Auto capable Chevy Silverado as well as my wifes Pixel 2XL connected to a Sony aftermarket head unit that is Andriod Auto capable as well.  Please fix, love the app and use it daily, so it is bothersome daily."

I will be switching bact to the cheaper version, Plus, for this reason alone. I much prefered the original format anyways. Over all, the station shuffle is the deciding factor for which version is better."

7301,Pandora,A Google user,2,0,"There is no reason to use pandora with every other music app being superior in every facet. Pandora does the worst job with playing artists you want to actually hear or even comparable artists. the app also crashes a ton and locks up. YouTube, Spotify, Prime Music, Apple Music, all are lightyears ahead. Not sure how pandora stays alive anymore."
7302,Pandora,A Google user,5,0,Always flawless. Enjoy many genres of music.
7303,Pandora,A Google user,2,35,"Updating my review. With each app update, this app just gets worse. Since the last update, this happens every two minutes with Ford Sync (and yes my Sync is up to date): ""Pandora is unable to play music at this time because of an unknown error."" It then continues to play music but with no other functionality, info does not display, can't skip or thumb up etc. I am a paid subscriber, but if this doesn't improve, I won't be after this month."
7304,Pandora,Thomas Cook,5,5,Great music!!!! I enjoy listening my favorite hits that I grown up with. You have some that I don't recall hearing for a long time. Looking forward for hearing many more that I grew up with on Pandora.

7306,Pandora,xDRAGONSTORMERx,5,1,"Stop offering me a free trial if I'm ineligable, dangit! Other than that, love it. Best thing ever for music and discovering new favorites. I wish there was an app for it on the ps4, its way better than spotify."
7307,Pandora,Madison Orchard,1,1,What did you do? I use to be able to interface with my car radio and now all of a sudden I cant control pandora with my car radio. I'm a subscriber and now I'm thinking of switching to something else because I cant see song titles or control it.
7308,Pandora,A Google user,5,7,I find what I need to get out of my head thank you
7309,Pandora,A Google user,2,0,absolutely love Pandora radio ive been a fan since it was first introduced. however the app doesnt work anymore. cleared all data and cache. reinstalled. it opens but it just skips songs over ans over and over again. itll show me a title but will automatically skip the song every second. wont even let me listen to ads. definitely a glitch that needs to be fixed.
7310,Pandora,jeannette,3,0,"I would give a 5 star if could stay on same song when pause. ads seem to increase if not used everyday. on occasion, just when your starting to get into a song, will skip to another one. I dont pay for service, so i get the ads part. i bought a car stereo that included 3 mo. premium. wont accept my code. never worked in app."

7315,Pandora,Jonathan Brown,5,0,i just do not like the adds up
7316,Pandora,Brandon Cole,4,2,so overall good gets the job done for music.... i deal with the ads because i dont feel like spending the money... but could you at least make sure they're in english? i dont speak any other language and all my ads are now in spanish.
7317,Pandora,Ivan Sarmiento,3,49,"There's such a wide gap for improvement. Start with the user interface, recently podcasts were just added, but man... Improve the search engine, the only way to look for a specific podcast is by ""viewing all""and if you type in a search you'll get a radio station instead of the podcast. Learn from other competitors. It's got great potential, but needs a better interface."
7318,Pandora,Sandy Prany,2,8,"I used to love this app over Google Play and Spotify. I would play this almost everytime I got in the car. Since the recent updates, it no longer shows the song information on my screen via bluetooth. The audio is fine, but I would like to know the name of the song playing, esp if it's new or a long drive. When I switch to Google Play though, the full music info is avaliable. This issue is frustrating enough for me to switch elsewhere if not fixed soon."

I should be able to just seeing it left it right to get rid of it but that doesn't work. If contacted customer service, I've deleted and reinstalled the app, I've adjusted my notification settings, nothing seems to fix it. 12/28/2018: still have to force stop the app to clear the player from my notification bar."

7328,Pandora,Ash,2,1,"Used to LOVE pandora, but now it just keeps clpsing and crashing on it's own after every other song. If this isn't fixed soon I'm canceling my subscription with Pandora. Not worth paying for something monthly that doesn't work properly."
7329,Pandora,Ray Wysa K,5,12,Great app. The pay version is awsome. Dont listen to the idiots who complain about ads. If you dont pay with money you pay with ads. Just like every other app out there. Mooches who cant pay a little for something they use everyday should just uninstall pandora. You expect free music for nothing? Buy premium and you will be pleased. Dont listen to the mooches who want everything handed to them without cost. No ads once you pay and unlimited skips. I have discovered music I would never have found without this app.
7330,Pandora,Dan Brock,1,1,"Used to love Pandora, but now they're forcing a useless notification in the notification drawer at all times. They claim it's a new 'requirement' that exists whenever Bluetooth is active. Uninstalling, will use Google Play Music and Spotify instead."
7331,Pandora,Melissa Woofter,3,0,"it is what it is. the right mix of personal funtional appeal with choice availability and user friendly functional software. only issue i disagree with is..as a premium contibutor, i should always have full music library capabilities. i pay a premium price but will see, at random (or a musicians decision?), certain songs and/or albums only used for radio use. as an avid user looking to have a set library to select from ive paid a monthly fee to operate i feel its not worth the money. refund? ha."
7332,Pandora,A Google user,3,1,I LOVE Pandora. It would get a 5 start rating if it werent for the only issue I have found. It closes out quite often and I lose the song I am listening to. Please fix this bug. I love this app and have for a long time.
7333,Pandora,Tyler Davis,4,63,"The current ""like"" thumbs up button does not function in an intuitive manner. Usually when you select something it lights up but in this case it goes dark and get surrounded by a curcular white outline. Considering it is the main way to control the content of your channel they should keep it simple and intuitive. Commercials are necessary but just too loud sometimes. I find it to lack music from around the world. It is very dominantly English music. I have to use other services to listen to some my favorite artists from around the world. This is a good music player for discovering new artists you may like. The classical relaxation channel is funny because it will have some heavy exciting compositions far from relaxing."
7334,Pandora,Crimson Camellia,1,0,"Now this app is really getting on my nerves. We have premium and I've had to sign out, uninstall and redownload three times and now, my added songs won't even download. Even when they did, it would stop downloading to a certain point and it's just so annoying...like it's really not that fokin hard."
7335,Pandora,A Google user,3,16,"I really enjoyed it before something happened to it. Now I have to restart the app after a phone call, if I pause for too long, getting in and out of my truck. Skipping songs seems to buffer part of the song everytime. I'm on the road alot so I pay for the premium but with all those issues doesn't seem worth it anymore. I was really happy before all that started. Also yes I deleted the app, cache, data and reinstalled and no fix"
7336,Pandora,A Google user,4,1,Though I was at a concert s couple of times
7337,Pandora,Brianne Turner,3,260,"I have Pandora Plus and the app used to work really well, no complaints. But over the past few weeks, the app has become SO SLOW. From opening the app itself, to skipping songs, to searching for an artist, each action takes about 10-30 seconds. Pull up search, wait 20 seconds for it to load, search for a band, wait 20 seconds for results. Just to be sure that I am not exaggerating, I just skipped a song and counted 22 seconds before the next one started. If you like the retro feel of a dial-up connection, you're gonna love this new update."
7338,Pandora,miguel rodriguez,3,6,A tad too many ads. And it should save the song you exit out from. When you are on Pandora and then go to snapchat or something else that's video/sound based it stops and doesn't restart. Then the song u were listening to doesn't get put on hold
7339,Pandora,A Google user,2,3,"I used to love this app but as another user said, it no longer works properly with Android Auto, at least on my Galaxy S8. It will play but when you try to skip to the next song just gets stuck saying loading and wont play. I'm going to start using a different music app. I don't have time to bother with tech support. When they release a new version I'll try it again and see if it's fixed."
7340,Pandora,A Google user,5,0,i love it but thing is IT DOES NOT HAVE ALL ME FAVE SONGS IN ONE the me is not a typ.o ok
7341,Pandora,A Google user,5,0,The greatest music app to listen to music of all types.

7344,Pandora,Troy Barry,2,1,keeps shutting music off and I have to restart constantly
7345,Pandora,A Google user,4,24,"Overall a good app, its easy to use and great for music (obviously). I've had some problems though, sometimes it gives me two ads in a row and I'm sure if its supposed to do that. I know that a function of Pandora is that it recommends songs for you based on what you listen to, but often it plays songs that are nothing like what I listen to, even if I click dislike on them similar songs keep showing up. A bug I've noticed is that it lets me add new artists, but not songs, to a station."
7346,Pandora,Daniel Batista,1,1,"new update constantly crashing, please fix update."
7347,Pandora,Haylee Burke,1,3,Considering uninstalling after this latest update. Pandora shows up on my top bar as if it's playing but it says unknown and I am unable to close it out without force stopping the app. It's not worth keeping on my phone if it continues to do this daily. Update: I posted this review over a month ago and even reached out to Pandora support. It has not been fixed and happens multiple times a day now. I have to go into my app settings and force stop it. Checked Pandora settings and don't see where I can stop it from popping up on it's own. It's too much; I'm uninstalling.
7348,Pandora,A Google user,5,0,have used for years. advice for new users: create different channels based on genre and 'like' based on that. thumbprint channel was great addition. love that you can get hours of commercial free time for viewing add when offered (but not required). adds are occasional and eq leveling is good (the shouting car adds are never louder than music). have discovered many artists I would have never heard if not for pandora. my 'go-to' music app for casual listening. replay feature is great as well.
7349,Pandora,Nick F,1,60,"So, since the update I too had the persistent notification. It seems to be a common thing with a lot of apps and Android 9. And the only way to fix broken parts of the app or when it doesn't behave is to uninstall and reinstall the app. Worked for me but I'm not going to do it every time I use the app. Could turn off notifications, but, that defeats the purpose. Tried all the setting changes before uninstalling and nothing worked."
7350,Pandora,A Google user,2,4,"This used to be my favorite music app, but after thumbing 1926 songs, (taking many hours and days and weeks) I upgraded to premium and lost 1500 songs! WHAT HAPPENED?) Then I had to call my credit card company to get my account canceled because I couldn't get Pandora to do it! I tried for six months while they continued to charge my card $10 a month! DISGUSTED!"
7351,Pandora,Greg Spielman,4,20,"What the heck is going on with playlists?? This app hasn't had an update in about a month, yet it suddenly keeps losing and re-finding my custom playlists! Is this a data/content issue? It needs to be fixed fast. I am not paying a Premium membership fee for THIS. Edit 01/09/2019: Ok, so this appears to be a sorting issue: the most recently modified playlists used to appear at the top. I can find the new ones for ""Add to playlist"" by scrolling way down. This should be fixed please."
7352,Pandora,A Google user,1,0,"it used to be good for several years, now they force music on you completely unrelated to the station, and when you skip the track they keep playing trash to make you keep skipping so that you have to keep watching ads to get more skips! Sorry Pandora, it was good while it lasted, but I'm switching to Spotify... BYE FELICIA!!!"
7353,Pandora,A Google user,5,0,can you please let me play my favorite music from hiphop
7354,Pandora,A Google user,5,0,Love love love Pandora! I've had it for years...
7355,Pandora,Jordan Gammill,2,31,"Me and my family decided to switch to Pandora and stop paying for Spotify, and the radio is great, but I'm not satisfied with Premium. Not one part of the paid features are up to par with my or anyones standards. The app needs a lot of polishing. Better organization, a bar signifying download progress, and maybe a dark mode. The app needs more customization and organization."
7356,Pandora,Beautiful Cryptid,5,3,why is pandora having tech difficulties? its been this way for days. plz fix
7357,Pandora,Rance Prentiss,4,0,Pandora is great. Very few things bad about it.

7361,Pandora,Joy Townsley,1,0,looking for radio music county and rock some oldies for some up lifting.
7362,Pandora,Elaine Akers,5,0,"I had Pandora when I was in NE, I AM IN TN ""NOW"""
7363,Pandora,Todd Hostetler,2,190,"This app is wonderful if you are going to primarily going to use the radio feature. I bought Pandora Premium and use it as my default music player and it is awful for that purpose. the songs have no orginization, they don't always download, or may become corrupt files. Uninstalled music doesn't always uninstall and the layout is very clunky and not that smooth. Like I said, it is amazing if you are just going to use it for radio but I do NOT recommend using it for a music library."
7364,Pandora,A Google user,3,6,It's a good app. But all I wanna do is cancel my subscription and continue to use the free version and I'm getting the run around on how to do it because I changed phones from when I originally started to subscribe. I went from android to apple. It'd be great if there was an easier way to go about it instead of me looking for over an hour and counting on how to do this. Other than that this app would be great. Also it'd be nice to have a phone service that actually answers instead of a machine that says we don't help you over the phone you have to email us for support. What kind of business model is that. Pandora your great but you fall severally short on the customer service side of things. Also would it kill you to play a wider variety of music on certain channels. Just because I haven't specifically liked someone doesn't mean that I just wanna listen to the same 50 songs every time I go to that channel. I like the songs and I like the people and I wanna continue to listen to them but maybe put some lesser known artist in the mix and expand peoples music bases so they don't seem so one lined.
7365,Pandora,A Google user,1,139,"I ysed to constantly listen to Pandora but today it just wouldn't open and last night it just stopped without warning. I was listening to Pandora earlier in an area where I never have a signal but now that I'm connected to wifi it just won't work. I've tried restarting my phone multiple times, triple checked my wifi, AND tried a bunch of other things and it just won't work. Please fix it because based off other reviews I'm not the only one with this problem."
7366,Pandora,Danny Zayas,3,180,"Ive had pandora for years and i love it, up until recently. Its a great program..unless you plug your phone into your car. Then it takes over Android Auto. It will automatically start whether you want it to or not when you start your car. It will also randonly start while in mid trip. It has been known to continue playing on your phone even after you unplug your phone from your car. It just forces itself to start, to the degree that im tempted to uninstall it out of sheer frustration."
7367,Pandora,Ty Tribble,1,1,"App started acting buggy, which led to needing to sign out/uninstall app and re-Install. Of course I lost all of my downloaded music. Now, I can no longer get anything to download, whether on a verified Wi-Fi or not. As a Premium subscriber, this is unacceptable. Customer service is notably absent, which makes the experience even worse. Terrible product! Not worth the money!"
7368,Pandora,Tracey Wolfe,5,264,I love Pandora. I use it almost every day. I have rarely had trouble with it other than a phase where several of my ads were in Spanish. If you take the time to rate the songs you can get an amazingly customized experience & the suggestions for new music are usually right on. The ability to have multiple stations & turn off explicit lyrics makes it ideal for work as well. This app has changed my daily routine in a positive way.
7369,Pandora,Paster B,4,9,"The UI is very easy to manage and everything you want is right there when you open the app; no extra ""recommended playlists"" or the like. The premium membership is very much worth the money in my opinion, as I have never thought about switching back to the free version voluntarily, and the fact that it is capable of charging to your Google Play account makes it more convenient, rather than having to put in credit/debit card information. My only real drawback is that there is no queue feature. Spotify and Soundcloud, have it, so why can't they have it too? Other than that, I have no real complaints, and this is a very good music streaming service."
7370,Pandora,J M,5,1,"Love Pandora Music they have a super recommendation engine. Very Very intelligent. Was a subscriber and very happy. Unfortunately they began running data consuming ads, Video Ads, dont mind watching a short ad for a free hour of Pandora. But they were running many, back to back video ads! And they changed the UI - it became unfriendly. Uninstalled the app. But I have missed my stations. So I am back and glad the UI is simple friendly. Proly gonna get Pandora Plus for $4 and miss all those ads."
7371,Pandora,whydoyou wanttoknow,4,4,"So far, I like it. Went ahead and paid for a monthly subscription, so I wouldn't have to listen to ads, and I could download and listen to entire albums, instead of having to hear a bunch of other artists in between songs. It's more convenient than listening to my iPod, even though I'm aware of Apple music .Only thing I'd like so far is the ability to thumbs up tracks without having to go into Pandora whenever my phone is idle and shows only the current track and artist playing. Oh, and licensing agreements for some artists/albums (a.g. Aaliyah), but I'm sure that's the case for all music streaming services."
7372,Pandora,February Armstrong,5,41,"i absolutely love Pandora music! There has been only a few times i have searched for a song and not been able to play it and that was because of copyright issues. Other than that, they have alomst every song you could imagine. Also, if you havent tried any of the subscriptions they offer, you really have no idea what youre missing! unlimited skips, ad free, download tge music you want, its AWESOME! <3 Pandora!!"
7373,Pandora,David Rutledge,3,7,"I pay the subscription fee because I'm often in marginal coverage areas so having the ability to have offline music is a huge thing. The last few times though that I went into an area that didn't have coverage, when I started Pandora, it kept trying to connect (showing the pulsing P) then when it couldn't connect, it would just give the option to retry or cancel (which exited the app). I get that there has to be some kind of periodic check that the license is updated, but I've been caught out by this enough times for it to become an aggravation. What's worse is that it's not always predictable when I'm going to a bad service area, so by the time I think to open Pandora to let it check the license, it's already too late."
7374,Pandora,EA Ballard,1,6,"I pay a monthly subscription fee, but it's constantly bombarding my phone with ads for Pandora premium. The widget doesn't work. To make matters worse Pandora is now owned by Liberty Media, a company that has made substantial campaign contributions to Donald Trump. I am choosing not to support a company that works to erode American values, destroy the Republican Party, and is okay with America being the laughing stock of the world. Subscription canceled and app uninstalled."
7375,Pandora,justin whit,1,0,I listen everyday but 2 major problems 1 the same song everyday you do kno these artist have more then one hit correct? play other songs by them not the same song over and over and over. 2. they always asking me on my desktop if I'm still listening because we dont want to play to an empty room. ok so i cant let it play for my pets? or im clear across the shop and have to go back to click yes im still listening. its a free app who cares? play the music its ur job regardless.

7383,Pandora,Matt Disrud,3,3,"I put on Metallica radio and in 3 hours I heard 2 Metallica songs. Now this wouldn't be an issue as I was looking for the style of music, except I heard ""Mother"" by Danzig twice, ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" twice and Hotel California in that mix. The ads I get. Gotta pay for free stuff somehow but it gets old constantly asking if I'm still listening. Just not that good of an app overall for those reasons."
7384,Pandora,TeddyPrior,1,33,"The constant inconsistency of what songs you can and cannot play is infuriating. I pay for what was advertised as any song I want to hear whenever I want to hear it, yet certain songs can only be played on radio stations so I would have to wait for it to come up randomly. I also still have a limit to how many skips I can make because some songs can't be skipped. Though what really frustrates me is how I can't even listen to music half the time because if I swap stations it just stops working. Now it won't even connect, download anything, or play any song I specifically selected."
7385,Pandora,J Goomba,3,7,"Aside from the awful ads (probably designed to be extra annoying to encourage purchase of the premium; which I typically recommend getting), the app is littered with bugs as every 1 out of my 5 clicks is received with a Technical Difficulties error forcing me to close and reopen, which even that does not always resolve the issue. Also, their algorithms are more than likely outdated at the time of this review; I have stand up comedy popping up on my classic rock station & Kendrick Lamar playing on my Blink 182. It used to be a great app, particularly for finding new tunes that match your taste; but I feel like it hasn't been receiving the attention it needs from the developers. I'm finally gonna give spotify a shot."
7386,Pandora,Lynn Marie,1,1,"I'm being charged for no commercials so Pandora uses the word ""advertisement"" and gives you commercials anyway unless you upgrade and pay more money. Horrible business practice. Probably going to change to a different music app."
7387,Pandora,A Google user,2,0,can't use with wifi on Samsung Galaxy S8 and no longer pairs with my Subaru.
7388,Pandora,A Google user,1,4,"App all of a sudden stopped working. It'll play for 30-60 seconds and then just stop. It frequently had issues before in my car (Ford Sync 3) but now it just completely stopped working. I thought it was my car so I connected my phone to a blutooth speaker at home and same thing happens. I tried headphones and same thing. Android auto works completely fine besides pandora. Even before this completely stopping it would randomly say ""unexpected error"" or something similar and either not connect or disconnect while driving for no reason, but only pandora. My other android auto features would not disconnect. This is very frustrating. Pandora is my only source of music while driving. I don't listen to the radio's crappy music and constantly annoying ads, I need pandora. Go back to the update as of Juneish 2018. I had no problems back then. Now it's completely unusable. I'm not being dramatic, it literally doesn't work. Now I drive in silence."
7389,Pandora,Jason Kober,2,15,"I have used this app for a long time and have the stations playing really good music. Recently, the app stopped connecting to my car's Pandora app unless the app on the phone was already running. After the latest update, which fixes bugs, it does not connect to my car at all. I was about to purchase the monthly subscription, but won't if I can't use the app while travelling."
7390,Pandora,A Google user,1,0,been using it worry free for years. recently it won't load if I thumbs down a song or skip. I was literally going to buy pro when this started happening. You lost out on a pro member for life. If it starts working again I may look into going pro but it will be awhile before I trust it. fix it!
7391,Pandora,Sweets McKay,5,0,love the app but the something wrong with the app I have to install and unstall the app over and over
7392,Pandora,Tiffany Lampson,2,3,"I have loved Pandora for many years. But lately I have been finding other platforms to use, as for the past few months Pandora puts an ad in between every TWO songs. And some of the ads talk about how I wouldn't have to hear them if I would just upgrade, and pay. I understand that's true, but it didn't used to be so many ads, or rude ads. I'll just stick to Amazon music."
7393,Pandora,Stacey Pilati,2,25,"OMG!! Used to really love this ap. I used Pandora back before there were ads, and then handled the occasional ad. Now ads are always covering the screen, OK delt with too. BUT!! now, because they want you to buy the ap and pay a monthly fee, they are constantly messing with the feed. All the sudden everything just stop. No music, no ads, nothing. Then you be listening along, the volume changes!! It will get crazy loud, then it will get minutely quiet. Adjusting the volume only makes it worse."
7394,Pandora,Anne Mathews,1,110,"I don't know whose side it's on but either Pandora can't get their program to work properly with Alexa or Alexa is screwing with Pandora. Latest Pandora update was 2 days ago when you tell it to play a specific station, then go into the app, it won't show what's currently playing. While in the Alexa app, if you select what is currently playing it will open it up then immediately close it again so you have to press it again to get it to open it back up in order to rate a song. Still cannot see the queue of songs it's been playing to go back and rate a song or just find out info about a previously heard song."
7395,Pandora,A Google user,1,51,"really wish it would not stream music immediately upon opening. then I am immediately met with to pop up advertisements trying to get me to upgrade before I can stop the music from playing not to mention adult themes commercials being played while I'm with customers, I choose Amazon over Pandora screaming. don't know why I download and reinstall once a year. lock screen widget also disappeared. need to take gloves off to unlock phone to control app. Deleted again"
7396,Pandora,Cameron Harris,5,1,"I really enjoy the Premium Pandora! I do wish it was a little cheaper.. But i'd say all in all it's well worth it. So with that being said, I would definetly recommended this app to all future subscriber's. Hope my brief review will encourage you to give it a shot. Hey you might get lucky like I did, get the 1st month FREE ( p.s. do know that you will still have to have a credit/debt card on file for future auto payments). If you decided you don't like it wait till the last day to unsubscribe ðŸ˜œ"
7397,Pandora,Dube Dollars,1,3,Using paid sub version with android pie on the one plus 6. Drains my battery like nothing ive ever seen. Wasnt like this before. In comparison from %100 battery after an hour of listening its at %87. Apple music after an hour of listenong im at %97. Please fix this battery drain issue.
7398,Pandora,Andrea M,5,6,"I've used Pandora for years without an issue. All of the sudden, past 6 months, i seem to be stuck in the kiddy pool of clean versions of songs. Like wth, really? I have made sure that explicit song lyric's is enabled, made sure i only thumbs up the adult version, if that's even a thing anymore, i even went and followed other stations just to see if there is a difference. Um no change. Nothing like hearing NWA rap clean.. um no ty. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app and still nothing. I'm giving 5 stars only because everything else works and im just going to chalk this up to ""user error"" and hope this ""bug"" gets fixed."
7399,Pandora,Custos43,1,5,"Ad's are inappropriate. I enjoy listening to classic rock and jamming out with my daughter on long car rides, but thats about the only time I have pandora open. Being that way i cant see a real reason to pay for a subscription when i listen to it ~4 hours a week. Having to listen to ""Adam and Eve"" comercials every 6 minutes with my five year old is uncalled for and shouldn't even be an advertisment on this app. Children shouldn't be wondering about a sex shop at 5 years old."
7400,Pandora,Shea Daly,1,31,"This app was great at first, but once you actually get into a station and you think it's going to play your songs, or your favorites, or something similar, It gives you a whole bunch of stuff that's not even close to what you actually like. I think it went from a music app to a promoting app. I've gotten to the point where I've thumbed so many songs down it won't even play the station anymore. But none of the songs were even remotely close to the band I put in for the station. I'm not sure what happened to this app but it's completely different than it once was. On top of that you get a commercial almost anytime you skip or thumbs down a song."
7401,Pandora,A Google user,1,36,"11/27/18- latest update still has not addressed issue where pandora has to be forced stopped even after closing the app to keep it from consuming my battery seems like it should be a simple fix to make sure the app is closed when users close it. I guess not apparently pandora is more concerned about how many ads they can squeeze in rather the the app being user friendly . Same problems after newest update. going to uninstall if this isn't fixed within the next few days. What's the point of an update that makes things worse? Glitchy, starts on it's own when in my car but I can't shut it off unless I force stop in settings I'm not sure I can continue to use it . I was going to go premium but with it being unpredictable I cannot justify it. Last update is really bad."
7402,Pandora,A Google user,4,0,good songs for free for like half an hour for a 15 sec ad
7403,Pandora,A J,5,1,I love Pandora! I use it everyday.
7404,Pandora,A Google user,1,0,The sessions are a LOT shorter now if you don't have premium
7405,Pandora,Luther Selby,5,0,its a great way to get intuch with my music from my youth
7406,Pandora,Makayla Willis,5,0,its so hype and it easy like 123 periodt.
7407,Pandora,Juan Tello,3,1,the new update won't let me open the app I have to keep going to the play store to use pandora
7408,Pandora,Christopher Franklin,5,0,I have about 18 1800 songs of my on Pandora
7409,Pandora,Star Hawkes,3,1,I've paid for the scription and I keep getting an licencing message where I can't skip a crappy songs that you app decides to play or it continusly plays repeats. Why is this when I've paid for it? I hope this is repaired soon or I'm canceling my order.
7410,Pandora,Ish Mendoza,1,5,"A friend got a free premium code and didn't want it so he gifted it to me. Thought he was crazy for just giving it to me, but after using it for a few months I understand why. Pandora is known for its radio feature, and after a few months I'd say its garbage. It replays the same liked song over and over when you keep down voting the awful songs from bands that is recommending until you get sick of your own liked songs. Its awful at finding fresh music after you give months use of data. Also even if you have a premium account it still plays mini ads. This app is only used as my last resort."
7411,Pandora,Ann Reinke,1,1,"Pandora itself is pretty low on my list of music apps, I find the song choices puzzling at times and repetitive all the time. For some reason, the Beatles will show up on literally every station I create. And I was listening to their jazzy 30's and 40's era Christmas station the other day and suddenly Josh groban popped up singing a hymn. The weird choices seemed to be getting worse lately, so I decided to cancel my plus membership. The app was confusing, I couldn't find where to cancel, so I followed the link to their website. Then followed it back to their app. A few more repetitions of this and I realize that apparently as I have switched phones since I signed up with this site, I cannot cancel subscription myself. A little irked, I contact online customer support and ask them to cancel my sub as my new app on my new phone won't seem to let me. I don't hear back for more than 24 hours, at which point they leave me the same useless link I kept finding everywhere on there website--minus the helpful tip that I wouldn't actually be able to cancel with my new phone. Luckily a friend reminded me I can contact my financial and cancel payment directly. Do NOT sign up to pay for ANYTHING with this company. You'll never get unsubbed."
7412,Pandora,MJK Urbanryderz,2,0,I loved Pandora I'm very unhappy with this app for some time now. Even after paying more than it should be each month just for commercial free and music lists. But I'm ready to delete permanently because of the constant buffering please fix also a free month to subscribers from time to time would make you look less $$$ hungry
7413,Pandora,irelandtay 28,4,142,"Very nice app which I decided to pay for the subscription..a few suggestions: please make the app available for split screen function, or some type of widget that allows me to keep the app over top of other apps. Aslo if there can be a like button for songs in the notification bar. Lastly please please add the year of when the songs came out!!! Lots of requests yes I know but I feel confident in the developers. Give me a reason to keep my subscription forever!"
7414,Pandora,Danielle Morrison,2,25,"I hate to give Pandora a two star rating because I've used this app for years, however I upgraded yesterday to premium before my flight to listen to music offline but Pandora would not download my playlists. I attempted multiple times needless to say I wasn't able to use it on my flight. Now I'm out of $10 as I usually just listen with the commercials on a regular basis. I heard Spotify is much better. I think I may try them instead."
7415,Pandora,Cameron Kellogg,4,1,"I'm not a big fan of not being able to keep playing the same song after you have disconnected from a Bluetooth device and it automatically pauses, so if you are in a different app (messaging app for instance) and lock your phone the song changes. I'ts just really inconveniencing having to reopen Pandora for the song to keep playing. I also found on the new update that the alarm doesn't go off at all. I really like being able to shuffle my different playlists."
7416,Pandora,Leland Parker,3,1,I pay for the premium pandora package every month and for some reason the app will not download music for offline listening even when I have wifi or cell service. Then shortly after I attempt to Download something the all fails. will cancel subscription soon if not fixed.
7417,Pandora,N.Greene,3,35,"What's happening with the radio today? And you can cut on the commercials a little, I mean 3 commercials in a row, with 3 minutes each, it's too much dont you think? Or you do that so you can make people pay more for commercial free radio? You already make money just by people downloading and using the app. Stop the greediness"
7418,Pandora,Shelby Orf,3,8,"Rather pissed recently with the app. not only does it have a million pop ups advertising the pandora one (like i get it, i know) but now my songs are being ""cleaned up."" I have explicit turned on... and I've listened to these songs hundreds of times and now all of a sudden they are being bleeped out? Some songs are not the same without the curse words there. Please stop ruining my music experience Pandora. Im gonna have to switch to Spotify soon."
7419,Pandora,Nelly Walker,2,1,"Listen, pandora is good for listening to music and waking yourself up. However, that first part is POINTLESS if you have to keep opening and exiting the app to play music! Whenever I leave the app with music playing, the music stops when I'm barely a minute or less in a song and i have to go back to the app to start it up again! I've done this more than 6 times today and its only 7:21 a.m.!"
7420,Pandora,Daniel Heppt,3,8,"App was great until recently after the last two updates. I paid for a premium subscription and it won't download any music to listen to offline. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app and it worked fine for a day or two, but now back to not being able to download anything. Very frustrating. Going to cancel the subscription and delete the app if this keeps up."
7421,Pandora,Chris Andrews,2,3,"I really like the music service but the app is terrible. The worst aspect is that it plays automatically every time you open the app with no way to disable that behavior. The ""feed"" is just an obnoxious way to shove ads down your throat. Performance is terrible as well. The app generally gets killed around 30 seconds after I pause my music on a Pixel 2 XL."
7422,Pandora,Karee Johnson,3,4,"I love Pandora, but I constantly have issues with it connecting to the app through bluetooth in my car. I've had my dealership update my car, but then Pandora does another update that make it incompatible again. For the past 3 months, all I get is a notification on my car's display saying Pandora cannot be found, yet it's playing just fine under the bluetooth setting. I'd continue using it under the bluetooth setting, but I cannot access my stations nor give thumbs up or down. My husband, who also drives a Mazda like me, is experiencing the same exact issues as I am. I wish Pandora would keep their updates compatible with cars that offer Pandora as an app. If they did, I'd update to Pandora Plus in a heartbeat, however I won't pay for something that doesn't work correctly."
7423,Pandora,Naomis Delgado,5,3,its really good but some songs you cant find on here
7424,Pandora,Taylor Perry,5,0,pandora is useful because when i play roblox I can listsn to music! five stars
7425,Pandora,A Google user,5,1,I love all the Oldies. Blues. Doo Wop Tejano Classic Rock i put on my Pandora.
7426,Pandora,Phan Man,1,5,Need to stop auto playing music upon opening the app
7427,Pandora,Alexis Merced,1,0,why erased the X icon to exit???????
7428,Pandora,Joyce Gray,5,0,greatest thing in the world. I love you god bless us all.
7429,Pandora,Richard Lowe,1,0,App always buffers and skips over songs. NOT what Im paying for...
7430,Pandora,Lilyâ€¢ â€¢Maag,4,0,it is an amazing app does exactly what you want but the only downfall is that when you first get in the app you get bombarded with ads to upgrade your app and get premium â™¡
7431,Pandora,April Valencia,5,0,the best variety of music n mix you can ask for.
7432,Pandora,Christina Hill,1,0,i cant close out the program . the Ã— in top corner is missing
7433,Pandora,Kyle B,2,1,"Notifications refuse to be dismissed.  Even if I pause a song and leave the app, I get a permanent notification with audio controls for the last song that was playing.  The X does not remove it.  It comes back almost immediately if I swipe it away.  The audio controls don't even restart the song.  I have to kill the entire app to get it to go away."
7434,Pandora,Leland Kriz,1,0,"It's a great idea as a whole but as a long time user (7 years) it's gone lower in the spectrum with new features that are not really useful or just a plane waste of space.I've had premium for 1.5 years and it's been ok no commercials or advertisements but still some songs are ""radio only"" even if the album is downloaded some personal (pandora made) playlists can't be removed which is lame it's a premium subscription you should have more options for a simplified version no podcasts or bull."
7435,Pandora,A Google user,1,13,The horizontal picture based interface is far inferior to the classic vertical. I miss the classic and was disappointed when I lost the option to select it this summer. One simple thing.... while driving it is much more distracting to select a different station with this new interface. It is a shame because I have always been a big fan. I prefer to stay. It is more likely if they bring classic back.
7436,Pandora,Allyson Ridgeway,3,1,Would have given 5 stars but since updating the app it just crashes more than plays. After I updated the app it's crashed over 5 times back to back. If that is fixed I will give 5 because that's the only problem Ive had with this app ever.
7437,Pandora,Frances Newman,1,20,"App worked great for a while, but after latest update it crashes as soon as I open it. I'm paying for premium so its really frustrating that I haven't been able to use the app for a couple weeks now. I've restarted my phone, uninstalled then re-installed the app a couple times but still doesn't stay open. Hope this is fixed soon..."
7438,Pandora,Jeff Cossaboon,2,1,"Pandora was better before the latest update. Granted, it would crash periodically. The new update seems to have removed some stations (?), and has removed the ability to alphabatize the station list."
7439,Pandora,Kimtray Basil,4,1,i would give stars but it freezes up and buffering to much
7440,Pandora,Christina Telles,2,25,"It's great when it works! My chevy volt has the Pandora app. My phone is connected to the Bluetooth in the car. When I try to run Pandora, it's great when I first start it but when I try to switch stations, I get Pandora error messages and I'm constantly having to close the app and restart it to get it to work which by the way is very annoying when you're trying to drive!"
7441,Pandora,Maggie Embach,2,18,I've been using pandora for about 10 years and only just recently has it gone down hill. It just closes itself out randomly and now will no longer stay open when I play pokemon go. Would give 5 stars but just can't anymore :/
7442,Pandora,Stella Parce,5,2,love that I can play music from my library and never listen to the same song

7448,Pandora,Allan W,5,0,"used to work great, now it wont work with my Bluetooth"
7449,Pandora,Joseph Beineke,3,0,This app is a buggy mess thats not intuitive to use.
7450,Pandora,Geoff Rathbone,3,1,"so i connected my phone to my mom's car via Bluetooth. it's a ford car. I was listening to Spotify but for some reason Pandora added a non dismissible notif. even after leaving the car i can't dismiss it. I don't even know why that's appearing. I'd like to give Pandora another shot someday, but I'm uninstalling the app. please fix this issue."
7451,Pandora,Kragothe Valour,1,56,"Bad app with even worse support. First the app keeps locking up when trying to log in on one of my devices. I contacted support and after trying two very basic things, that didn't help, they said they can't help me. On my main listening device I download all my thumbs up (premium subscription) songs but they are rarely there when I use offline mode. 700 songs, 3GBs worth of app data, and only 0-10 songs play while in offline mode. I'd ask support but they'd probably try nothing and give up again"
7452,Pandora,Dwayme Fuller,5,2,very good selection of music to play.
7453,Pandora,Drew Granger,3,12,been using the app for years & love it! The ONLY reason I gave the app 3 stars is simply because there is no longer a shutdown button for the app! when I first downloaded the app it had one where did it go?! now it's a bit of a challenge each time I want to shutdown pandora which is becoming an inconvenience! please developers fix this issue!
7454,Pandora,Paul L,2,1,Music stops when trying to skip or change stations requiring force close of the program. also doesn't always open with Android auto. Shows error loading within Pandora when Google Assistant tries to open. to fix this i have to clear cache. this occurs every few weeks.
7455,Pandora,Denise Hirchert,1,3,"I cant find alot of songs due to license restrictions. Same goes for playlists, replays, and skips. You cant add A LOT of songs to playlists and can only skip so many or give a thumbs down to so many. To better explain, if it is a song you cant replay, then this means you also cant search for it, add it to a playlist, download it, and it wont play in your thumbs up playlist. These are license restricted songs. I have the premium. Wont be doing any more than the free trial. So disappointed."
7456,Pandora,Mr. Breeze,1,0,"well pandora, you have really out dumbed yourself this time! i would never pay money to such a leftist clown of a company but free... ya il do that. until i turn on a CHILDRENS station for my kids and suddenly an ad comes on talking about lets get naked! so i turn it to a christian christmas songs station, same ad! i know you leftists are all for sexualizing young kids and murdering babies but not in my house. i wouldnt care if they paid me to listen, i still wont, nor will my family! uninstall!"
7457,Pandora,Erika foxx,2,2,Dark mode pls . Get with the program ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜
7458,Pandora,Meagan Bisby,3,4,"I gave this 3 stars. As of lately it hasnt been working for me at all. Im on wifi (excellent wifi) and it keeps buffering songs, saying my connection is bad and stops playing songs half way through! But it plays the ads like a dream! What happened? I have used pandora for years, i dont even care about the amount of ads, what is going on that it isnt working? Straight up not working for me"
7459,Pandora,Jeffrey Evans,3,1,Great selection of songs and super easy interface to use. What I don't like is how long it takes to launch the app. It takes a good half minute for the songs to play. Pressing the play button gives you no indication on whether the app is frozen or waiting to load. Works OK once it actually does start working. Need to really fix the app load times.
7460,Pandora,A Google user,5,2,Love it ! Totally Awesome Indeed!
7461,Pandora,Nigel Xie,5,4,"Perfect, but Notification stell a little buggy.ðŸ˜‚"
7462,Pandora,Red Cipher,3,2,"It's alright for listening over short periods of time, but it tries to obviously push you/trick you into buying premium and the skip restrictions are infuriating. I thought that the ""one hour uninterrupted"" was the solution to this, but after only half an hour for me all the songs became ""licence restricted"" which means I was roped in to watching an ad for no reason. All these things really hold back that over all, the song recommendations and actual music this app should be focused on are pretty good."
7463,Pandora,A Google user,3,2,"I love Pandora radio alot. I listen to it alot, basically the only music app I regularly use. But I am giving it 3 stars for now because the app hasn't been working right lately and it's getting very irritating. I get errors such as 3005 and technical difficulties when I try to like or dislike songs. Please fix and I will give a better rating."
7464,Pandora,Sara Morris,1,12,"I would give a 5 because this has been an app I've used for yearsssss and when I upgraded I fell even more inlove, until recently when the update happened and now it's showing on my notification bar that it's running and it's not. I've tried EVERYTHING and it's soo freaking annoying. The icon is always there and it's ALWAYS on my notifications/status bar. It bugs me so much, help?"
7465,Pandora,A Google user,1,3,"App crashes constantly. I tried to upgrade and the app doesnt recognize the account status, pandora support is garbage as well have fun! Its been 12 hours since i reached to Pandora support and I haven't even received a response. I went through all the trouble shooting guides and manually reset the app. This is ridiculous."
7466,Pandora,DYTangler,1,6,what happened to this app? It used to be great and then after the last update now if I answer a phone call or go away from the app it crashes and shuts down. On top of that if I navigate away and come back and it doesn't shut down its skip the song regardless of where it was at. also stop endangering Me by putting up a screen that I have to manually look at and click away from to get to my song.
7467,Pandora,Kayla Breen,2,1,My Pandora won't play at all I've restarted my phone I've turned off the data I've turned off Wi-Fi and it just won't play and keep freezing my phone up. It's starting to get irritating . I pay $10 to have music not an app that keeps freezing and shutting off. now it won't play swears in any of my songs. I think I'll be switching to amazon music ðŸ‘
7468,Pandora,Chris Scott,2,98,"started out a 5. slowly goin down. Free trial was great, seems the minute i started paying for premium it wasnt the same. Not able to play any song from artist ""see all songs"" gotta play the albums, on my ipad only, which is the device used 99.9% of the time. works great on my Android (not an apple product). Description says play any song. any where! Not the case!! emailed about the issue, was told to shut device down and restart. Did just that, didn't help!! Emailed several more times, NO RESPON"
7469,Pandora,Guenevere Cunningham,4,1,"Great app. Would reccomend to anyone who doesn't have service and wants an offline mode for music. Love it so much. Has been a little buggy lately, but still better than anything I have ever used before."

So you have to force stop..vicious circle here!  2/4/19 was off Pandora for  awhile, thought I start listening again but Nooooooooooo, the app does not won't work at all.

7478,Pandora,Kathryn Brownell,2,2,"It's just so frustrating that you can't listen to songs in other languages on this app. It will play one song in another language, and then 10 songs in english, no matter how many english songs I thumb down. I've heard spotify is better for this - it's like pandora *wants* me to take my business somewhere else."
7479,Pandora,Emberly Benitez,3,0,"I love this app but after my premium trial ended, the app has been crashing and giving me error codes every time I open the app. It really sucks when I'm in a rush to workout and the app is giving me issues. I can't work out without music, if this was fixed I would give it 5 stars."
7480,Pandora,Christina Marie Doss,3,1,I've been a pandora user for many years and recently decided to subscribe to see how I liked it and noticed immediately that one of my favorite pandora options disappeared or either I couldn't find it. The option to choose what stations you suffle was either gone or in a different place. Then I decided I wanted to cancel the subscription and read online that it has to be done on something other than a mobile device which I dont have. I signed up on a mobile device but cant cancel on it.
7481,Pandora,xSPLITTINHEADSx C,2,1,The comments section needs to come back
7482,Pandora,Lynn Tromborg,1,0,I paid for premium and just this week it's been crashing...I can't even use it! Please respond to those of us who are writing about this problem. After 5 years I'm canceling my subscription and trying iheart or another similar app. I'll gladly return once there's an update or fix.
7483,Pandora,TL Jeffcoat,3,1,"I used to love Pandora, but although I don't have many issues I do have enough to finally stop using Pandora after years of loving it. The drop-down from my notifications seems to have disappeared which is incredibly inconvenient and the ads are increasing which is only somewhat annoying. I'll keep using Pandora on my TV's for background music at get togethers, but Spotify has fewer ads and plays exactly what I want without random unrelated songs sneaking into the playlist and it still has the notification drop-down working. Not to mention I love having an adjustable equalizer in the Spotify settings. Pandora, you need to keep up with the competition or you're going to get left behind."
7484,Pandora,A Google user,5,13,Pandora Music offers song selections I had previously been unable to find. ðŸ‘
7485,Pandora,Nate Phillips,2,0,newest update has caused the app to constantly crash upon using it.
7486,Pandora,Gacha Cookie,4,1,Its okay but when you need to re-subcribe its stupid bc i have to and if you dont you have hear music and then it plays a song you didnt even ask for then you have go on the song then your music stops then and you have to back on and its just annoying ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡

7488,Pandora,A Google user,5,0,pls. stay consistant . thank you very much
7489,Pandora,Janessa Ray,5,2,i LOVE my Pandora. its amazing. the best app out there for some tunes.
7490,Pandora,Love Girl,5,1,I love Pandora all thr songs are free for me to listen to i love it best and have everyone of my favorite songs
7491,Pandora,Eliza Thomas,4,0,it's great in almost every way except for needing internet and ads. I understand as because that's how they make money but if they make money that way cant they make it not require internet. if I'm strolling the town why my friends and want to listen to music I have to use data which gets annoying I recommend they make it not use wifi because they're already making money from ads
7492,Pandora,Danesha Taylor,4,0,i love listening to music on my phone with Pandora
7493,Pandora,Bron _,3,1,"I like the setup but hate the ads. I did a trial of premium and everything got messed up. Make it like the hour of free after a 30 second ad, don't make me choose between a functional ap and a crappy one but add free"
7494,Pandora,Celeste Lane,1,2,"I don't know what's going on with Pandora right now but everytime I search an artist or a song it keeps popping up ""error 3005 try again"" and I don't know why. Can you fix that or something cause it's really aggravating and it's making me mad. I can't even enjoy Pandora anymore when it keeps popping up the same mess over and over again"
7495,Pandora,Chris Henick,2,6,after years and years and years I never thought I would do it but I've got to say goodbye to Pandora... I'm uninstalling it... The commercials have just got out of control and I am not paying for a music service. I remember when there was just maybe one commercial every half an hour but now every song sometimes.... it really feels like they're trying to shoehorn you into paying for a subscription.
7496,Pandora,TJ R,2,1,"App crashes constantly when trying to download music. No easy way to download your entire collection, must do it one at a time. Every time I pause the music and the app closes it no longer shuffles songs. Widget doesn't work half the time. If I wouldn't be getting this included in my phone plan I would go back to Google music."
7497,Pandora,Song Bird,4,92,"I love this app but I wish whenever I play a game on this phone that the music wouldn't cut off on me. Like when I open up a game that already has music to it, I mute it and let my Pandora Music app play a song but then like 30seconds later it cuts off and removes itself from notification so then I have to keep going back to the app. This repeats SO much. Please make an update that the song will keep playing when you enter a game and WILL NOT cut off."
7498,Pandora,A Google user,5,1,I love it I don't got to gi to YouTube no more

7500,Pandora,Zorukia,2,1,"I love Pandora, I really do. But i've been having a lot of issues lately. Every time I open the app, it spams me with error messages and then crashes. Also, I think that charging $10 a month and not allowing anybody else to use the account - not even 1 add-on or family member - is ridiculous. If i'm paying $120 a year for this, I should be able to add a family member or child to the account."
7501,Pandora,Sean L. Kraemer,1,2,"Ads about every 2 songs, every skip, & channel change. It's getting worse every day. Music cuts out w/spotty reception, ads never do even w/zero antenna bars. What's the deal with pushing Artificial Intelligence on users so heavily (85% of the ads). If you guys are using AI to judge the happiness of your audience, time to consider a change. As a 10yr user of your service, I've rarely been so disappointed."
7502,Pandora,Jennifer Ridge,5,26,"Pandora is AMAZING!! I was a paid subscriber for years when it was cheaper. But now the ads are bearable (like a radio station, grouped in chunks vs. every other song). My only only complaint is I can not pick an individual song to listen to. I end up opening YouTube or Spotify when I just want that one particular tune stuck in my head, to go away! Amazing regardless for.what it does. Way better than spotify for station listening. It's clean interface has amazed me since Pandora began over a decade ago. Please add single song capability and millions will leave Spotify. Thnx"
7503,Pandora,John Gardner,1,20,"I've been a pandora user since 2011 and have loved this app for years, but lately the algorithm for which songs play on what stations seems to be completely broken. When I make a station for 80s Rock for example, I should not be getting Adele songs, just as when I make a station for Adele, it does not make sense how Metal and Reggae music are also being played on the same station when I haven't thumbed such songs on that station. Will gladly change this review once the original algorithm for selecting music is restored."
7504,Pandora,Nathan Kulmer,1,2,"Just started a free trial of Premium a few weeks ago and hate it so far! Annoying music player notification gets stuck on your phone and have to force stop the app to get it off, which I've seen other reviews on here mention as well. Auto plays on app startup which is so annoying! Can I pick a song or playlist first please!? And now it has added some random playlists to my collection that I DID NOT add myself and won't let me delete them. Pandora radio may be good, idk I've never actually used it, but Pandora Premium is ABSOLUTE GARBAGE!!! If you wanna do a free trial like I did that's up to you, but PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON IT CAUSE YOU WILL ABSOLUTELY REGRET IT!"
7505,Pandora,Kent P.,3,1,"just be careful what you like. I liked one live song and now half of the songs played seem to be live. I liked the song, not the fact is was a live performance. Stupid way of doing things IMO."
7506,Pandora,Jason Hutchinson,1,1,it crashes when its running with my workout app.
7507,Pandora,Pandajumper H,1,0,i give it a one cause you nedd a zip code i mean what if pepole dont have a zip code

7509,Pandora,Karena Clay,5,0,best radio music app! the update was bit much....too many options lol
7510,Pandora,Patricia Rodriguez,4,0,"Good selection for drives, but I was disappointed that eventually the same songs started repeating. I guess the drive was too long. I would really like to be able to select the album to play in entirety or select the specific songs from an album"
7511,Pandora,A Google user,5,0,amazing! i can listten to all my favorite songs!
7512,Pandora,T T,4,0,It was a 5 but now it's a 4 because I cant close out pandora on my notifications nor the app itself without logging out.
7513,Pandora,Donnie Morrison,4,0,I don't really like the ads but other than that it's a really great app
7514,Pandora,Alex Alvarez,4,0,i.love my pandora premium but i cant delete songs in playlist please fix
7515,Pandora,A Google user,5,2,I love to listen to my music from Pandora
7516,Pandora,Beau Jenkins,2,2,"I've been with Pandora for a long time now. I've moved to a country that doesn't support it, I now use a VPN on my phone so that I can use it and it works. But I'd love to know why I pay for PLATINUM and it only gives me PLUS I'd love it if they had some sort of support but I can't find anything. Please give me the membership I pay for you my money back. It's not fair. Please fix and I'll give a five star rating that this app should have."
7517,Pandora,Star Miller,4,3,"I love this station but every now and then I have to uninstall and download because it will say ""access restricted due License in country"" or ""check your internet connection"" even though my WiFi or data is acting just fine. And then I'll get the occasional I'm not going playing anything and just be a blank screen with the radio station name only."
7518,Pandora,Jaquilyn E,5,0,"good. overall the best music app i have ever used. there are a lot of good recomendations, although there are a lot of adds. i listen to it everywhere i go. i like how you can sign in on more than one device without having to re-sign in every time you use your account on a different device"
7519,Pandora,Tina Thomas,1,2,"I don't have the finances to buy a premium account, so I'm cool with commercials. That's what you get for free, right? I could make playlists and get 30 mins, commercial free (if I watched an ad 1st). Now, the commercials are longer/multiple and you only get 10 minutes maybe. I think I can uninstall this app."
7520,Pandora,Robert Short,3,7,"So I love the algorithm that finds common music to what I am enjoying, and even the number of advertising is good for a free service. What annoys me is the notification control never disappears even of I close the app, it requires you force stop the app every time, and what's worse is the notification control does NOTHING, it just says unkown with a play button that does nothing. Please fix"
7521,Pandora,_.Lilieee._,2,1,"I love pandora, I do. Their music selection is absolutely amazing and everything is just beautiful but Pandora has been crashing lately. It will also randomly skip songs, and on my laptop it falt out wont work on the online site. I would give this a 5 star but there are problems that have been going on for awhile and havent been fixed. Sorry"
7522,Pandora,Michael Craven,3,2,"Avoid the Thumbs Up button at all costs. I get that it is supposed to offer similar music to expand your horizons, but it uses the most miniscule details to suggest new music. For example, let's say you build an Avicii-centric EDM station and you Thumbs Up up Broken Arrows ft Zac Brown. Pandora will start throwing Zac Brown Band songs at you as well as a slew of other country artists that have nothing to do with the EDM station you tried set up."
7523,Pandora,Sergio Marrufo,1,0,pandora plays everything you don't want to hear and when you shuffle your stations it plays what you take off shuffle instead. I don't ever write reviews but I think this had to be said. I deal with it most of the time. I'm forced to uninstall and redownload just to reset it.
7524,Pandora,A Google user,3,0,"it would be a 5 star but it always messes up on System of a down station, says it doesnt know what else to play...like more system of a down ya dumb app. anyway besides that I love it. I have premium membership. Fix that issue for me please. I uninstalled and reinstalled and nothing!"
7525,Pandora,AliMali,1,3,"I'm so frustrated with Pandora lately. For the last few months it keeps freezing and I have to force close it. Every time I use pandora within 30 minutes it does this. I use Spotify more because of this issue. I've tried uninstalling, I've tried restarting my phone, nothing works. Please fix this!!"
7526,Pandora,Charles Huerta,1,2,"Just did a recent update yesterday 11-19-2018 hoping the reboot issue was part of the ""bug fixes""... but NO! every time I disconnect a Bluetooth item or use any other internet required app or pause and then black out my screen... Pandora seems to have to reboot and start all over every time this happens... doesn't matter whether it's an hour or 5 Seconds...... this is such an important thing for me that I'm thinking of going back to Slacker after the last two years of Pandora use! ðŸ˜  but changing"
7527,Pandora,A Google user,3,2,"I overall really like the app, but I don't like that they put a bunch of random music in a radio station that isn't even in that radio station of songs listed. It takes forever just so I can listen to the songs I like on that radio station, and I can only listen to them once and that's it and I have to spend another 20 minutes of my time finding another song in that station that is listed and I like. In the future I hope that gets fixed so I can still listen to the music I love."
7528,Pandora,pindragon66,2,3,"not working and i pay for premium ? i had to unistall the app after a day of it saying ""can not open in offline mode"" and reinstall - all my downloaded stations are gone now - finally able to sign in and play music after all this hassle (i'm not on wifi often): offline mode doesn't switch itself on most of the time - music just stops - then i have to search for the offline mode while driving or something - the downloads don't just download for some reason - it's a little pricey for so many issues"
7529,Pandora,Samer Khatib,1,10,"There is a persistent notification that says ""unknown"" for both artist and song. That comes up the moment I use Android Auto in my car regardless if I actually use Pandora. Since I already use Play music I am thinking of removing this app and not renewing (I only installed because of TMobile Tuesday deal). I know I can disable notifications for the app but then it becomes useless if I want to listen while doing anything else on my phone since I would have to go into the app to pause. Give us the option to swipe notifications away and I would gladly reinstall the app."
7530,Pandora,Dale Powell,5,2,i like the Beatles music early and later in therw music
7531,Pandora,Lori Smith-Grubb,5,3,i enjoy this walking my dogs and cleaning my house to name just a few ways i get my hand picked stations.
7532,Pandora,Constance Adler Galloway,4,4,love free pandora on my bikes or doing yard work hooked up to my ear buds or party speakers always great selection of music!
7533,Pandora,baldie dude 11,4,0,it has this song that I didn't think it would have but they changed 2 of my favorite songs to radio
7534,Pandora,Zachary McGraw,5,0,love this app when you have unlimited skips it will also make a thumb print radio of all ur favorites and an offline mode for when u have no service
7535,Pandora,abigail carr,5,0,this is my favorite music appðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ§
7536,Pandora,Mark Miller,5,0,great radio that beats to the tune of your ear specifically by letting it know if you like songs or not.
7537,Pandora,Lorraine R Moses,5,0,hope for the best by all means
7538,Pandora,David Wils,2,3,i enjoy Pandora but i have a couple issues... 1 if i my skips and watch the video for more 2 is kind of annoying. and 2 this is very big when i restart my phone and do not load Pandora i get a notification saying the app is using battery. why? if i don't even load the app. also after i use the app and close all my apps I'll get that alert too. the only way to get it to stop is to force close the app... please fix that and I'll give you more stars! the skip issue isn't that big of deal
7539,Pandora,kayleigh cullum,4,1,"I got a new debit card and forgot to update my info, so I lost my premium, along with all my songs that i saved. Then i tried to get it back, and in the process canceled my subscription AGAIN. I wish it was all saved with the account it was under and all the info wouldnt be lost. I love pandora and cant use any other music app though."
7540,Pandora,Katie Doerrler,1,2,"I currently pay for Pandora premium because I can't use wifi where I work. This allows me to listen offline without using my data. recently the app no longer opens on my phone. It gives me the message ""Sorry, this content or action is not available in offline mode"" but won't even give me the chance to switch it back to online. Useless now and I have to cancel my subscription and not be able to listen to music at work ðŸ˜ "
7541,Pandora,A Google user,5,37,"This is my absolute favorite music streaming app. However, it's been crashing and skipping songs nonstop. Happens on both of my phones, different manufacturers, different carriers, different configurations, and regardless of using WiFi or different mobile data companies. Have already cleared cache and data, reinstalled, disabled battery optimization, white listed on antivirus tool, updated to latest version, etc. I'll change the rating and review once it gets fixed."
7542,Pandora,A Google user,1,1,said it was free then asked for payment scam
7543,Pandora,Delaney BrummÃ©,1,2,"This app reminds me of one of my ex-girlfriends: if I stop paying attention to it for more than a second or two, it shuts down. Everytime I pause the music, or make a phone call the app completely restarts, leaving me wondering what I did wrong. I've been flirting with the idea of upgrading to Spotify, but honestly I'm kind of scared of what Pandora might do. So this is just a warning to all you guys out there, no matter how desperate you are, she's not worth it. You are stronger than this."
7544,Pandora,Michael Kreeger,2,135,"Pandora fails at designing channels. I selected an artist channel and in two hours heard exactly one song by that artist. I ran out of skips as a trial account trying to hear the music I actually wanted to hear, on a single artist channel. If I had wanted to hear something OTHER than what I requested, I would have requested that other thing. Stop filling artist named channels with garbage from ither artists."
7545,Pandora,broo ke,3,4,"Pandora is a great music app, but whenever I leave it it'll keep playing the song. for the next song, it will buffer then skip the song. I have to go back onto Pandora, disrupting what I was doing, and an ad will come on then start playing music. idfk what's going on. Not worth the hassle but I hate Spotify...so :/"
7546,Pandora,Samuel Henderson,3,28,I don't like the way it plays the same songs no matter what playlist I go to. Even with Pandora Plus on my offline playlists it plays the same limited variety of songs. Other friends with regular Pandora seem to get a wider variety of song mixes than I do with Pandora Plus. I'm thinking about unsubscribing and deleting the app because I get tired of the same songs all the time. Even my Thumbs Up playlist has a limited variety even though it shows over 180 songs it plays the same damn 15 or 20 songs over and over.
7547,Pandora,PapiSantoes S,3,1,Pros: Awesome Music Cons: App will automatically close when paused or when you open another app this happen to me many times. There offlinemode would take me 2 to 4 attempts to play my music offline and certain songs could not be downloaded.
7548,Pandora,wesley kreitzer,3,3,"Can you fix whatever you did that makes the app stop, close, and reload anytime you jump to another app or answer your phone. Also when you give permission for your car to open the app you always have the notification that its ready to link to your car even tho your not running bluetooth, or near a car period. You cant get rid of the notification at all until you take the permission away.... and yes im a paid account..."
7549,Pandora,angryfiercedonut bearclaw,3,10,"Usually amazing... However, since the free trial release for premium I've been plagued with session timeouts, force closes and I'm now unable to access any of my stations. Can't use an otherwise awesome app. Wish I would of stayed with plus instead of going for the free trial of preminum... My past experiences are the only reason I went with three stars instead of one."
7550,Pandora,Luke Watson,5,3,AMAZING LOVE IT. PREMIUM WAS SO WORTH IT.
7551,Pandora,Ashley Brown,1,0,"I will be honest and say if you need to speak with pandora support, they will get back to you but they don't give a damn about you, or your concern. They aren't concerned about your experience with them, they just want your money. There's too much competition out here to just settle for less. SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ELSEWHERE!"

7559,Pandora,Bill Ward,1,0,plays same songs over and over and over .
7560,Pandora,Idiosyncratic Child,5,6,"I absolutely adored this app. Pandora honestly does ""sound like you"". To be candid, it adapts to play more of what you want to hear, easy to use and helps connect you with music you never knew you loved. Yet, that's not even the half. Pandra is positively unlike any other radio."
7561,Pandora,Shmoken Aces,1,10,"Ads are too agressive and very intrusive. Two full screen ads that I have to push through to set the sleep timer, showing ad front and center when I am trying to look at the current artist, and the ad comes back faster than I can inspect the album cover. Audio ad frequency is not bad, but many of the ads aren't suitable for work."
7562,Pandora,Amber Duncan,3,24,"Omg I live Pandora but it won't work. It says can't connect to the internet. I have full internet connection. I even tried to uninstall and reinstall to see if it would work now it won't even let me sign back into my account. Please fix this problem. I don't want to use a different music app, but if it doesn't get fixed I will ."
7563,Pandora,Chris Dougherty,3,3,"It needs fixed... it closes on it's own when I turn off my truck the app fully closes and needs to be reopened but only sometimes other times it works like its sapost to, I go in the store come out get in my truck start it up ""boom"" music starts right back up where it left off. other times it pauses (randomly) and it starts back up when i unlock my phone yeah that's safe when I'm driving I've been using pandora since since 2012 I love it but it needs to be updated/tweaked to work more correctly"
7564,Pandora,arshiya sabaa,3,2,"I love that they have all the music and and stuff but, the ads keep popping up and they take forever to load for 1 song and then when it's done I press back and it exits out of my Pandora. And whenever I try to set up an alarm the station button never works and it really gets on my nerves. Cause the WI FI is awesome and I tap and nothing pops up the screen juts turns a little dark. so imma just give it a 3."
7565,Pandora,Doug Welling,2,16,"A good idea to add, might get more people to download this, make it so you can change the songs u thumbs downed. in case you hit one on accident. and just a small option, but it gets really annoying when I just opened the app, listen to one short song and then get 2 or 3 ads in a row. I know your trying to make money, but that makes me not want to spend a dime on this app. is that just me?"
7566,Pandora,Kari Baxley,5,4,reilly good i can find all the songs that i like
7567,Pandora,Tonya Lonergan,1,41,"I have been paying for the premium and it won't even open after the stupid update. I will be cancelling my subscription. I'm not going to pay for something that I can't use. I have tried a million times to get it to open and it crashes, I uninstalled it and reinstalled it and still the same thing. I want all my money back. This is garbage and I'm beyond pissed off."
7568,Pandora,Rachel C,1,2,"not too thrilled. i updated it, and now its saying none if my stations ate available. id really like this issue fixed because i listen to pandora all the time, and usually have no problems. please fix this soon."
7569,Pandora,Nik Coffman,4,6,"Been paying $10 a month for over a year now. Everything was great till a couple months ago, they keep saying ""improvements to reduce crashing"". . .I'm still waiting for that to be true. It'll crash at least once every couple hours, doesn't matter how I'm connected. Still my most used app, I just love it"
7570,Pandora,David E,1,5,"awful awful awful. does not work as advertised... i hate the music it forces you to listen to. if pandora's program actually worked as advertised they probably wouldn't be loosing subscribers by the 1,000s...  when you thumbs down it still plays the song you thumbed down! how many times do you have to thumb down an artist until the program understand you don't want to hear that artist?! i have literally had to thumbs down dozens of songs in a day!  i realize it's $5 per month, but it's not even worth that. no pandora = less irritants in a day for me! i'll go to spotify."

I don't know which advertising exec or developer at Pandora thought it was a good idea to pronote this little witch, but they havr the entirety history of music and all of today's artist to choose from and she's the living piece of garbage they choose to represent their brand? Way to make your entire platform suspect, you've lost all credibility with this listener."

7585,Pandora,Dannie,1,0,used to be a great app but now they have an ad every other song and they play the same 20 songs over and over. also stations dont make sense i've played marques houston (r&b) radio and country music will come on. They have become just as annoying as fm radio. I use spotify now.

7589,Pandora,Polar Light,3,8,It was good... But then it wouldn't play any music anymore... every time I would go on it nothing would be playing and it would tell me it's buffering. and trust me I have very high speed internet in my house. we have a huge house and it's enough to reach all 3 floors... I mean I hate when this doesent work and I would like you to fix my problem. Maybe it would leave a higher rate.
7590,Pandora,A Google user,2,0,"It doesn't work. It always says ""unexpected error"" and its annoying"
7591,Pandora,Caspian MK1,2,1,"Won't turn off. Even when i stop the player and swipe it away, it comes back on with Unknown/ Unknown as the artist and song. The player is great but this is annoying. Please fix it"
7592,Pandora,Sheryl Rhobyne Youngman,5,11,Worth every red cent. Can't wait for the voice activated update! I use Pandora on my way to and from work via my car wifi and it makes me wish I lived further from my job. The variety of content is staggering and I'm frequently discovering new artists I never would've been exposed to on the radio. I appreciate the huge volume of comedy stations too because sometimes ya just need a good laugh. An enormous bank of sound machine options for when I'm on vacation. Kid choices are unending. Love. It.
7593,Pandora,BaÊ•al Ander,1,31,"Why would anyone pay for a music app that consistently crashes for no apparent reason in the middle of a track? Daily, often, and requires the app to be restarted. Very frustrating and unnecessary. Who knew Pause would crash the app as well? Finally fed up. Uninstalled. Amazon Music FTW!"
7594,Pandora,A Google user,1,1,"Very bad business practices! They will not honor their subscriptions purchased through Google Play Store. Will cut your service off before your termination date and not offer any refund! Let's you use Google Play to pay for individual accounts including Family, but not honor the family subscription. Then why do either! They will advise you to cancel current subscription and resubscribe directly through them. Abandoning this service for one more reliable like Spotify!"

7600,Pandora,Erin Lamaster,3,2,Absolutely loved this app until the latest update. It crashes multiple times a day. It will switch songs randomly. And suddenly I have ads when I spend my hard earned money to NOT deal with ads? Wth? I'm about to demand my money back if I'm not getting the services I'm paying for.
7601,Pandora,xiomelis Ramirez,3,1,I got the subscription because the offline music but it doesn't work for me. It be happening for months. It just keep shuffling and never stop till I get service and I go online again. For that I would use the free membership. Please fix that. I live in nyc I need music for the underground train.
7602,Pandora,MOBILE THINGS,3,16,Quite annoying that it automatically starts playing music the moment the app is opened. Doesn't appear that there's a setting to disable that. I don't use this app more than necessary & it's good to see that they've had most of the music by artists I search for. Only downside I find in these services is the lack of obscure music that I thoroughly enjoy when I do hear the hidden gems.
7603,Pandora,Dorothy Brown,2,21,"I created a Christmas Radio ""station"" and expected only Christmas music of the genre I wanted. Pandora kept playing inappropriate music or music that has nothing to do with Christmas. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE! This has happened to me for several radio ""stations"" I created. I am currently a subscriber and now want to drop them altogether. Pandora needs to get their $hit together because I hate paying $9.99 per month for $hitty music experience"
7604,Pandora,Nikole Irizarry,2,20,"Songs get jumpy. Doesn't let me update my playlist. It's keep telling me that it's having ""unexpected technical difficulties "". For how long I wonder?

7605,Pandora,Kara Whitely,1,1,"every time I open any other app on my LG Stylo 3, Pandora crashes. usually it happens with Facebook and Facebook Messenger, but it needs fixed... Also, waaaaaay too many commercials... You play 1 song then two commercials? That's a bit much."

Even some old satanic music like EXODUS-MERCIFULn FATE- KING DIMOND- SLAYER. and then all the way to country and even 1 of mu favorite female artist PINK.

7615,Pandora,Dario Nanbu,3,2,"i like not having to think about playlists, but this app has never been stable. How does it lose the song it's playing while it's paused for 10 minutes? Also the premium isn't worth it, since they can't play on demand all the songs they play on the radio mode. Found that out during the trial."
7616,Pandora,tristan tobar,5,51,"my thumb print plays everything i like from rap, rnb, and rock. . to country and marriatchi. it's the most brilliant idea Pandora placed in app for its users. what i also like is that Pandora tries to stay updated on events that are live wether or not in my city its cool to know of concerts and events being a huge music fan n all. another great feature is the summary of the band(s) or artists biography and how they've come to light, pretty cool app to play music n get to kno the artist."
7617,Pandora,Hunter Hazlewood,1,0,"i upgraded to the premium so that i wouldnt have ads and so i could get unlimited skips, but it still limits skips and you cant just listen to any song at any time. you cant even download some songs for offline use just like it advertises. 0/5 would not reccomend to a friend . cancelled my subscription."
7618,Pandora,Mark Antony,2,20,"Imagine meditating to some soft melodic music and ""KARATE GI!!"" blows your eardrums out. I'll start with saying that I've stuck with Pandora since it's public launch. Back when it was advertised as a free music streaming service without interrupting commercials. Adds came later but they were minimal. Now it's a whole other level. I understand a company has to make money somehow but Pandora simply doesn't have the same motivations that it did when it launched. I've just uninstalled."
7619,Pandora,A Google user,4,7,"As I am computer illiterate, I had my daughter install the Pandora app on my phone and now I can listen to MY type of music during my 2 hour work-outs at thr gym; Im not sure how the programming works but it seems to know exactly what I like to hear & it makes my gym time much more enjoyable. Thank you..."
7620,Pandora,Vlad Zolotarov,1,2,Bogus software! It works terribly with Android Auto - Android Auto is unable to render its screen on Huyndai Santa Fee Sport 2017 when Pandora is playing. As a result you have to navigate with Google Maps only by voice commands. Not to mention that the whole can not re-play or skip back thing is so dinosaur. I only use it because my car has a built in Pandora app. I wish they had a Spotify instead.
7621,Pandora,Alyss a,1,0,this app is foe old people like my mom i want to use spotify like the cool kids
7622,Pandora,bev Gillen,4,1,listen everday after so long it really knows what you like so i hardly ever search for a song.

7624,Pandora,Sadie Lesneski,3,0,"I enjoy using this and the new Poscast feature however a ""next episode"" button would be fantastic. If you're starting a podcast that was hundreds of episodes you need to constantly flip back to the next episode. letting it play it goes backwards in episodes (ep 3 to ep 2) instead of forward. frustrating"

7632,Pandora,JoJo Winfield,5,5,"I have been using Pandora for years and I recently upgraded to the Pandora Plus for $4.99 and after years of paying attention I have the best radio stations on the planet, depending on my moods and when I create a Shuffle, Pandora always finds something new to throw in the mix to get me listening to similar artists. I like it better than YouTube Music."
7633,Pandora,Andrew Schaffer,1,1,"So now I can't skip songs due to licensing?!? Are you effing kidding me?!? I PAY MONEY TO SKIP SONGS!!! Not have it so I can't. If that doesn't change. And I mean, real quick. I'll take my money elsewhere. I'm NOT gonna pay to skip songs, to not be able to skip songs."
7634,Pandora,SL Doty,3,2,"When for instance I pick a station like Celine Dion why does it play other artists, you pick that station because you want to hear them. Not the artists they like. A bit confusing to me. Please let us hear them more if the channel bears their name. Otherwise I like the app. Thanks"
7635,Pandora,Lola Thomas,1,1,My songs will not download for offline listening and it's becoming a problem. I gave it 2 weeks for it to be fixed and it's not. I've already uninstalled and reinstalled the app twice now! I am about to cancel my subscription and ask for a refund if this problem is not fixed ASAP!!!!
7636,Pandora,A Google user,5,4,This App is so amazing you should check it out!
7637,Pandora,Renaldo Frye,3,2,"In not completely down on Pandora, but it seems the variety is limited. Most frustrating is that if I leave the app to reply to a message and return to Pandora, the app restarts. I don't know why, but you lose the song you are on and rarely can you scroll left to replay that song."
7638,Pandora,T Ladyies,3,8,"would provided higher as my experience has been great until late.....my offline playlist are no longer available, I get that they will update when online but my expectations is that they would auto download as well....now even when I am connected to WiFi, they do not download.... I checked my premissions, logged out, uninstalled...this experience is causing me to consider if I should renew my subscription"
7639,Pandora,Brett Butler,1,19,Keeps this annoying notification that can't be removed now with play controls have to force close app. This has been an issue for over a month. I'm switch to Spotify or iHeartRadio. All thanks to lazy developers that never read these issues that people have I'm not the only person with this problem.
7640,Pandora,eric latimer,3,2,"Fix pandora on xbox one, also I have about 30 radio stations for each of my fav artists/bands/genres and especially for artists, even if they have wide arranges of music,its like all the channels want to slowly coagulate into the same channel, which I personally find this the most annoying part of pandora. Not the constant restarting it on xbox one, not even the cheesiest adds Ive heard on it. But in fact the slow blend of all the DIFFERENT channels, that I very much so want to keep different."
7641,Pandora,Sylar Barnes-Laufeyson-Rogers,3,1,"Good as usual but every time I click ""show more"" on the lyrics to a song, they dissappear completely. It's really annoying and when that's fixed, I'll update my rating."
7642,Pandora,Kirk White,3,1,"I like the music choices, but wish I could rewind sometimes. I like to hear all content, and sometimes I don't understand. Mostly I wish it didn't use so much data. I went on vacation, and ran out of data, and then the buffering start's, and I don't use it anymore. That's why I think it's ðŸ‘Œ, and needs improvement."
7643,Pandora,Gary Alexander,5,3,It works well for me I think it's a fantastic service.

7652,Pandora,Jimmy Hardwick,5,0,I use pandora all day every day I love it!!
7653,Pandora,Stephen H,1,0,"Aholes remove your ability to create your own variety within a station. They make everything depend on having a PC, and using the app is extremely limited. The whole premise is to force you to pay to play. Even the free stuff is massively screwed."
7654,Pandora,Mary Jo Anderson,4,2,I have the paid version and loved this app until the last update. It stopped working with my Acura app. I found an older version online and installed it and now it is working again. I had to turn off automatic updates on my phone to keep Pandora working. I hope this can be updated without its losing the ability to play in my car.
7655,Pandora,Benjamin Tuell,5,110,It uses way to much Data now. It didn't used to use this much. It has used a 11000 mbps in about a week. If I can only use this ap on WiFi or have to pay for premium. Then those 4 stars are easily a 1 star. If it continues iHeart radio here I come even if it don't work as well.
7656,Pandora,Ben D.,2,7,"As Shrek once said, it's getting it to shut up that's the problem. Got Android Auto? Then you're listening to to Pandora and having it suck your mobile data whether you like it or not. No way to stop it from auto launching, and no way to close the app if Android auto is running."
7657,Pandora,Chad Craft,1,2,"First off, its NOT free, and its not the old Pandora you used to love. You will pay dearly with a sickening amount of adds, ruining the calming mechanisms of the music you love, and in form with the rest of this accepted level of greed only add to the nurotic streesful mess being inficted in us in so many various forms. Stand up for us and CUT THE CORD ! Its the only power we have against the Power mad greed killing us all. Sad to see Pandora adopt this , sad but TRUE."

7664,Pandora,Charlie Kelly,1,0,"I used to love Pandora, but ever since the update, Pandora doesnt work on my Android Auto in my car. Most stations won't load and if they do, I'll skip a song and it will just say ""loading."" Cant be bothered to use Pandora any more."
7665,Pandora,TJ Martinez,1,9,my friend convinced me to try pandora again after years of using spotify. The app crashes immediately after opening it. I used to use pandora all the time before smart phones and have very fond memories of it. The fact that it used to be good is what makes me angry. Otherwise I'd just laugh at how bad it is. You can't get more than one star if your app can't even start up.
7666,Pandora,Richard Zemel,1,28,"Switching to Spotify Premium after 1yr of Pandora; Why? Spotify has more obscure & emerging artists & Pandoras' flaws, ie: Shuffle Mode-plays the same songs over & over. Playlist-adding individual songs to multiple playlists is a multi step process. Artist Focusing-can't really play 1 artist's music unless I create a separate playlist or am willing to listen to the album. Right now, I'm with both because switching apps is hard to do...so do yourself a favor & go with Spotify"
7667,Pandora,A Google user,5,5,"It really fun to listen to music but there is one thing. I can't save the songs that I like to a playlist.

Which makes me very dissapointed because I wanted to hear the songs while I GO on other apps but they don't have them. Very bad Pandora."
7672,Pandora,Michael McNutt,2,1,"Used to be good, but the frequency of repetitive commercials and recent inability to remove the app notification at the top of the screen has driven me to give up and delete this app, which is unfortunate for Pandora as I was about to purchase a paid subscription, now moving to other apps."

That being said I have a slew of issues with the app, such bad issues, that I'm gonna have to kindly turn my back on yall and switch to SPOTIFY. See it started with the offline mode. I download the songs so I can listen to them offline. Easy? nope. Every time you add a song to your playlist it automatically downloads the whole playlist over again. Doesn't seem like a huge issue"

7689,Pandora,Windi Cullen,1,2,I have paid for the upgrade and it still won't let me replay or skip. I'm so sick of this with this app. This is the second month in a row now. I want my money back and my account fixed!!!
7690,Pandora,Adam Laughlin,1,23,New version sucks. It doesn't completely shut down when you close now and stays in the notification tray. I have to force close just to kill it so it's not running in the background. Cancelled premium because it is such a pain to sort through my saved artists

It has so many issues. Pausing the music, refreshing the app, telling me its timed out or theres an issue contact support (which I've done and it went no where) and crashing completely all the time. It does it everywhere so it's not a service thing or wifi, it's the app. worked fine before a recent update. FIX IT!"

7701,Pandora,Big Napkins,4,0,"""Free"" streaming music! Catered to your preferences.That's the good. Now the bad- soooo many ads. Want to click forward? Ad. Click back? Ad. Between songs? Ad. Also, ads are very loud. About the worst thing in the world is listening to a calm and relaxing song, only to be brought back to reality with a loud screaming ad. Of course, they offer a paid plan that gets rid of ads. Hopefully all of them."
7702,Pandora,Gary Weidell,5,9,The developers of the car dock app I use with Pandora in my 2013 Lacrosse issued an update to fix the compatibility issues I've been having for some time now.

Then all of a sudden all of my stations play mostly censored songs. The titles aren't but the songs are. Makes no sense. Spent 30 minutes trying to find out how to just contact support only to get a generic response saying thanks for my comments and suggestions and they would be noted. Responded to their reply just to get the same generic response again. From the other reviews it seems pandora doesn't care at all. Doesn't matter if you have the free service or the highest paying plan. Dont waste your time with this app"
7706,Pandora,N. Burke,1,0,SO. MANY. ADS. LITERALLY EVERY OTHER SONG.
7707,Pandora,Cody Nethercutt,4,0,great app but it would be better if there was no ad
7708,Pandora,Minnie Lenard,5,1,love it listen to it almost ever day at work
7709,Pandora,A Google user,4,3,its AWESOME but a lot of ads but plays good music
7710,Pandora,Barry A McIntosh,5,2,it greatly appreciate that Pandora internet Radio is ðŸ’¯
7711,Pandora,Gachagalaxygirl Gamer,5,0,"its really good if you have data you can listen to it anywhere free,amazing all you have is watch ONE ad to have access to MILLIONS of songs i recommend it to everyone who likes to listen to music!enjoy amazing songs with to best the songs ever!"
7712,Pandora,Mike koschnick,1,1,"Since the pie update on note 9, on sprint the app constantly force stops! I'm a pandora premium customer and I can't even use the offline mode. PLEASE TRY TO FIX THE PROBLEM SO I DON'T HAVE TO CANCEL MY SUBSCRIPTION!"
7713,Pandora,Ryan Hathaway,5,0,amazing!!! just wish we could replay
7714,Pandora,Braxton Carrier,2,5,"The recent update was terrible, at least for me. The first two songs take forever to load and, when they load, buffer multiple times in the song. Afterwards it's fine with the occasional buffering. Keep in mind this is with 4 and 5 bars of service"
7715,Pandora,Joshua Leigh,3,3,Great app. Needs a couple improvements for 5 star. Mainly just not making the song playing skip when connecting/casting to an external device. Other than that its just expanding your song licenses especially for those who are subscribers and it would be 5 star. Also works great on my phone but wont go past login screen on my samsung galaxy tablet running android 4.2.2
7716,Pandora,Sabre Callicutt-reyes,3,2,"starting to remember why I deleted this app the first time. I pick an artist station. the first song is by the artist then everything not, which completely ruined why I picked a particular artist to begin with. I am going to have to find something else I think"
7717,Pandora,Justin Stiner,1,0,"Barely works with android auto, locks up when you try to change songs, forces you to choose a different channel, and then it will play. I use this app in the car only, sucks that I hear the same songs over and over. It doesn't matter if you are using the free or premium service, always plays the same songs that I heard the last time I was in my car. My thumbprint has tons of songs (about half if them I have never thumbs up so I don't know how they got there), but I always hear the same songs."
7718,Pandora,Charles Denny Dixon III,3,2,"Wish when my phone allowed the pandora app to buffer or load song completely , but why doesn't it store the song(MP3) to the phones system storage. That would make this Application one of the top five for sure. Please consider this change for the two parties that would benefit the most."
7719,Pandora,Joseph Vigil,2,5,It's my go to music app. But what I don't like is I put Smashing Pumpkins radio and I'm lucky if I heard 1 Smashing Pumpkins song in an hour of listening. I heard a lot of Foo Fighters and I can't stand the Foo Fighters! That's why it's getting 2 stars.
7720,Pandora,Ahmad Dennis,3,6,"Just need some updates! I can't download music for offline listening and I've pandora premium. I understand they have to cater to so many different andriod devices, still a great music app. Google pixel 3 XL"
7721,Pandora,Joshua Gallipoli,1,2,This has progressively become the worst music app for advertisements. You will cycle through the same 6 songs no matter how you vote. Every 2 songs you listen to you have two unskippable 30 second ads back to back. You will also have to close the same ad for the paid service over and over.
7722,Pandora,Sergio Bobadilla,1,8,"Its slow, the feedback it gives when making selections and downloading songs seems confusing. Its not my internet because it does the same offline usage. Slows down my phone to hell while playing music even though my ram memory on my phone and speed is normal. Compared to other music app it isnt my first choice personally."
7723,Pandora,Mary Fisher,5,2,"I love pandora! I listen to it while working out, driving, in bed at night.. I also love the premium because I can create my own playlist and search and play random songs."
7724,Pandora,A Google user,3,0,"Music is good, works as described, value of my paid version it's good. The program will not clear memory. Continues in background constantly. This reported flaw has been reported for years in the tech press, they brush it off and refuse to deal with it. They won't change it, they try to shift blames to your phone or provider. I need to decide if I am willing to put up with it any longer and cancel my subscription or put up with Pandoras anti consumer policy."
7725,Pandora,Anthonu Goytia,3,2,"it would be nice if the same songs wouldnt play over and over again. same Pink Floyd songs. same Nas songs, same everthing. i have it in shuffle and still have to skip so much im forced to watch an add"
7726,Pandora,Ernest Clark,2,4,"Increased ads as of late. I completely get it, you don't pay for premium you deal with it. Not a problem. But if I have to hear the same Adam&Eve ad that I've heard for the last 5 years one more time... I want to be able to recommend this but I'm not sure I could anymore, variety is dead in this app, same songs over and over, same comedy recordings, same ads... Time to switch to spotify or something."
7727,Pandora,BBW 02,2,0,pandora doesn't want to work it opens but music doesn't play
7728,Pandora,A Google user,5,0,Easy and I enjoy picking out my own music.
7729,Pandora,Randy Cleek,5,2,the last update has fixed the problems with the app so far.
7730,Pandora,randy robbins,1,4,app crashes after 15 seconds after this update
7731,Pandora,Alexia A,5,0,Best app ever to play music and listen to podcast for free!!!!
7732,Pandora,l lee Heinsen-Ligocki,5,0,always dependable wherever I am!
7733,Pandora,Christopher Muse,1,0,Restarts halfway through each song. So annoying.
7734,Pandora,Josh Wright,4,0,"My only con is they say with Pandora plus, you get unlimited skips. I've subscribed to Pandora plus and that is actually false. You do get a lot more skips than basic Pandora, but it's still not unlimited. There were times I have skipped about a dozen songs, and it would stop and it would suggest you upgrade to Pandora Premium for unlimited skips. But other than that, Pandora is a good app for if you're driving for hours or you're working at a shop, and you want a lot of music to listen to"
7735,Pandora,A Google user,3,13,Certain songs from an artist play too much. Sometimes it's nice to hear a deep cut not the uber popular one that we are burned out on. Choose an artist then many songs are from what Pandora thinks is a like artist. Give us an opportunity to hear just that artist no other.
7736,Pandora,A Google user,5,8,"Don't like that the Thumbprint channel plays songs that I did not ""thumb up"". It plays artists and songs based on what you like, just like the other stations. You would think that you could get your favorited songs only on that station."
7737,Pandora,1SelfSain3,1,0,"I've been using Pandora ever since it was a web page and before it became an app or anything else I used when it was still obscure. Watching the company develope, to use an obscene amount of ads and videos while getting rid of the thing that made it Pandora, the variety of music and showcasing new or similar artists it leaves me baffled why I would still use it. Even the premium service in Pandora is a joke the number one feature I looked for when I used it was the ability to just listen to the songs that I liked but even that wasn't a feature that they actually offered when you went to do it it said some of these songs are only available through Radio play and didn't offer to just skip those songs outright didn't allow me to do it. It just repeats the same songs in the same order. Now I'm at my last straw when I start the application it just sits there it doesn't even do anything. With a number of streaming services such as Spotify and YouTube Red I find it deplorable that Pandora doesn't attempt to become a better service provider but in fact becomes worse as things go on. I hope things turn around real soon because I personally prefer or rather used to prefer Pandora over all of them."
7738,Pandora,Summarah Hampton,3,3,"It doesn't fully deliver on its option to listen to a playlist for free by watching/listening to an ad. After 2 songs, it chimes out and starts playing one of my other stations. Aside from that, it's my favorite music app. I can put it on and forget it. Beautiful."
7739,Pandora,Noah Cooper,4,3,"Overall this is a good app to use for listening to music. One thing I'd like to have is the ability to add an artist to a playlist that was created by Pandora. On some of them I can, but all of the ones that are created by Pandora I can't add an artist and it is very frustrating. Fix that and I would not have any complaints."
7740,Pandora,Tommy Gunn,4,1,"easy to use, good selection of favorite music and new stuff being added all the time. multiple genras for different moods. easy to download and add to playlists."
7741,Pandora,A Google user,5,0,I love southern gospel music it is uplifting and spiritual to me!!!
7742,Pandora,A Google user,3,0,"I have always been a fan of Pandora, however there has been a long standing bug with the notification screen, where Pandora ia always listed as though it were playing, only the track information shows as ""Unknown"" and you can dismiss the message or click on the oyher controls. If you ooen Pandora and start playing something, it will be replaced by that track. Close Pandora and eventually the broken notification will be back. It isn't a show stopper, but it's been there long enough to be let down"
7743,Pandora,Ben Franklin,5,3,has given MANY Hours of pleasure where ever go.
7744,Pandora,A Google user,5,0,just let me pick my music files!!;
7745,Pandora,Elias Ulbrich,5,0,It is the best music streaming service that I have ever had
7746,Pandora,Miracle cruz,5,0,it relly help me with listening to depression music now i am not depressed
7747,Pandora,sean kifer,5,0,this is one of the best music applications ever
7748,Pandora,Emmanuel Dodoo,5,0,You can find any type of music you want
7749,Pandora,Antony Early,5,0,good actually amazing if it would work
7750,Pandora,b. keiffer,4,0,great service but also room for improvement.
7751,Pandora,Krista Carter,1,4,SO glad i switched to Spotify. They're actually worth my money! Can't stand Pandora. Every time I play a station it stops in the middle and skips to a different one. Not easy to navigate at all. Always buffering. I'll NEVER use it again!
7752,Pandora,J,1,17,"Is it all stations or nothing in shuffle mode? I just want to be able to put two stations on shuffle so I can just play relaxing music to fall asleep to. Oh well, guess you can't do that anymore. You use to be able to. Pandora is just going downhill I guess."
7753,Pandora,Lue Xiong,4,1,"great app. love it. I have the premium edition. you cant add EVERY song, some will have licensing issues. no biggie. I also use a note 8, there is no physical home button. I have to scroll up from the bottom of my screen, in the process, it would fast foward whatever song I'm listening to. maybe the team could fix this minor issue? move the time bar up a little higher? all in all, highly recommended app."
7754,Pandora,Evangeline Guevara,1,11,i liked the options of playlist and all but I've had the last straw with Pandora. My service got cut 2 weeks early do to an error and they gave me 2 weeks free of the Pandora plus when I've been paying for the premium. Not the 1st time ive had problems with you either. so im done i give up
7755,Pandora,Katsuki Bakugou,2,0,within the laatmonth when evwr i try to use Android auto (which I know is not the app that's at fault because it doesn't even work on Bluetooth) when i hit next it freezes up for 15 minutes or more i camt even swap between stations without it not loading any music for long periods of time. FIX THIS!
7756,Pandora,A Google user,1,0,"I was afraid that when Sirius XM bought Pandora things would go down hill, but I didn't think it would be so rapid. SIrius turned into the worst broadcast music outlet on the planet. Their billing was a joke and there customer service was the worst I have experienced with any vendor. How can you expect to make any money if you can't even get the billing right? Now Pandora is starting to take the same path. I have been a loyal customer for many years and listened all the time,  I recently experienced a hard drive crash and lost everything. One of my first priorities after getting a new computer was getting the Pandora interface so I could get back to listening to all the good music. I have searched the web for the desktop program that I used before and there is nothing remotely similar out there. Having Windows 10 (which sucks) is not helping matters. I never minded paying for this service because I was a heavy user but I guess I will look into other music services."
7757,Pandora,A Google user,4,10,"Great app for creating a custom list without losing the possibility of finding new music. The pop-up screens that advertise premium services are difficult to clear without accidentally ""clicking"" in - please provide an obvious ""No, Thank you"" button."
7758,Pandora,Rude Boy,3,4,Notification will show up randomly with a phantom song. It won't go away until you turn off notifications for the app and then back on. It reappears days later.
7759,Pandora,Nykoelas Manning,4,0,"I love the app, but I have one issue with Pandora Plus. It is supposed to give you your top three stations plus your thumbprint for offline (the top stations being updated each month, but my thumbprint is one my top stations and the algorithm counted is as both giving me only three offline stations."
7760,Pandora,Kiwi 2205,3,13,"l love the app it works very well, but im have a hard time down loading songs. I alway free up space when down loading new songs, but the download will freeze and never start or finsh the download. I have to keep reseting download or unistall and reintall to make it work again it stared to get annoying. Are yall going to fix this any time soon?"
7761,Pandora,A Google user,5,1,i love you get to play your own music
7762,Pandora,Robert Sterner,1,5,"Still running all the time on my Pixel 2 with Android Pie. Also starts itself when my phone connects to my car, though that setting is off. I have no interest in a notification that won't go away. Probably going to switch to something else for now."
7763,Pandora,Topher Jones,3,0,"I'm starting to seriously question the whole system that they have for choosing songs to play. I thumb up one movie soundtrack song, now my feed is almost exclusively movie soundtrack songs. I start a new channel of a different category that I already have and within a few songs it is the exact same music as other channels. It has also become a running joke in my car that we will be having a good time and want to listen to music, so we'll say ""let's have Pandora screw up the fun of this drive"" and never seem to not be disappointed by the horrible song choices."
7764,Pandora,Yes R,1,0,"if Pandora doesn't fix this, I'm cancelling. they have advertisements which I'm fine with since it is a free service otherwise, but I cannot open it without being confronted with request to upgrade to the subscription service. There is no way to turn off the app so it routinely connects to my Bluetooth and starts playing even though I am trying to save data. there is no feature to stream only over Wi-Fi, so it wastes my data when it pops open. I'll switch to Spotify or buy music if not fixed."
7765,Pandora,A Google user,5,0,i love pandora been using it for like 2 years now so finnaly decided ti rate it ðŸ˜‚

7777,Pandora,Graystone Hill,4,0,"Needs player controls. The ads are pretty annoying, but that's fine since I'm not on a paid plan. What's really baffling is that this app doesn't have player controls on the lock screen or notification shade like every other music player I've used on Android. That's an absolutely necessary feature, especially if they want me to upgrade to Pandora Plus or Premium."
7778,Pandora,Craig Williams,2,6,"Problem 2: Alarm clock unreliable with ridiculous requirements Problem 3: Text size on Fire TV is impossible to read. Lots of free space on screen, USE A NORMAL FONT SIZE! Overall: Service itself very good music wise."
7779,Pandora,Matt Mayer,1,98,"Media player notification is constantly randomly appearing and can't be swiped away or closed using the X. AutoLaunch notification frequently appears/disappears and also can't be swiped away. The constant, broken notifications alone are easily enough for me to uninstall. Significantly slows down Android Auto launch time, often enough to make it time out and automatically close in my car. Frequent system notifications saying Pandora is using battery, well after closing it."
7780,Pandora,A Google user,1,1,"App uses tons of resources (memory/CPU), crashes often, and controls are buggy. I have been a paying Pandora user for years and really enjoy the service. However, the new version of the app is unusable and the new pricing is very expensive, so there are many other options available. I think I'm ready to cancel and look for other options."
7781,Pandora,NonViable Venus,4,1,"Years ago I used Pandora as did my mom for a couple. I stopped for a long while opting for Spotify. I was aware the format and commercials were similar between iHeart Radio and Pandora but didn't know about the excellent free membership features of the latter. I sincerely appreciate being able to the exact song you want as many times as desired within the trial period, unlike Spotify. The only thing I wish is there was an even wider selection of music! A great app that exceeded my expectations!"
7782,Pandora,Deshunta Henry,2,3,I used to love this app so Much...but whyyyyyy in the entire hell would you guys get rid of the quit button with the upgrade please tell me how to stop it I've been forced to go to my settings then apps then force stop it every time otherwise I can only hit pause and it's continuously draining my battery this really sucks!!
7783,Pandora,A Google user,5,0,"Love the music variety and being able to find a specific song <3 Pandora runs wicked good on my phone also in comparison to any other music app.'s You had me at hello :) <3 Your company has come leaps and bounds ahead of the competition and for all the right reasons. Thank you for making this an option to every day people to enjoy any time of the day without the financial burdens and being the more personable company <3 Hope anyone out there reading this has a very Merry Christmas and may 2019 bring many enjoyable memories with family, friends, community members, etc."
7784,Pandora,chazz Thomas,2,1,If you like a song don't let this app know. It will make you sick of it faster than the radio over playing a top ten 20 hit. Don't bother making more than one station. It will play the same songs you liked from your other stations that you're tired of hearing.
7785,Pandora,Lance Vandyke,4,84,the updates with Pandora the last few months have been good and steady. don't crash very solid. also the Android auto update is much appreciated too!!! only reason i gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because on the Android auto there still NO TAB TO ACCESS MY SAVED MUSIC WHILE IM DRIVING forcing me to pick my phone up. PLZ add a my songs or some kinda tab in android auto to access are saved music thank you
7786,Pandora,Eric P,5,3,would not have any other music app

7790,Pandora,Sharon Prescott,5,0,I love the music that is offered on Pandora!
7791,Pandora,Shelley Antoinette,2,3,"Music Selection sucks. I created ""Stations"" to hear that genre or type of music. Instead im Getting Gospel on a non Gospel station and basically all its doing is taking my thumbs up songs playing a mashup of them no matter what station I choose. I hear the same songs constantly and for $10 a month its not worth it"
7792,Pandora,Jordan Courtney,1,0,"I've had Pandora for seven years and it used to be great. The ads are way too frequent, and now I constantly get ""This station is currently unavailable"" even though I've only skipped 2-3 songs all day. By the time I've been at the gym an hour, Pandora has blocked all three (yes. three.) metal stations I use. I bet if I paid their subscription fee this problem would magically disappear. I'm defaulting to iHeart for all my workout music."
7793,Pandora,Britney Rochte,2,1,i love this app I listen to music everyday on a drive to and from work but ever since the new update when I go to skip a song it freezes and doesn't let me listen to music anymore. can you fix this please!

Second, the app is stuck on stupid after trying to switch from offline mode to wifi...it keeps wanting to open but it tells me that ""that option is not available offline"" FU"

NO NEED TO CANCEL OR ENTER EXTRA INFO. you can listen to any song, track, or album. make a play list. if you subscribe to iTunes, Sirius, XM radio or any other services like that, then try premium and you'll switch. much better option!ðŸ¥’"

7830,Pandora,Jonn Thaule,4,21,"Overall I love Pandora. I've had it for years, and it's totally worth the $5 to avoid the ads and have free skips. The algorithm that picks the music has weird days occasionally, and it picks a few songs to play A LOT, but 9 out of 10 times, it's what I expect for what I pay."
7831,Pandora,Shaun Crook,1,0,"I've had Pandora for quite a few years. This is by far the worst experience with Pandora I've ever had. Not only are my playlists gone the music that I try and download and then listen to later doesn't download, or at skip to another song that I don't want to listen to and it won't let me listen to my thumbs up radio station. Pandora you need to fix yourself because you're sucking right now real bad and I don't like it and I'm not going to pay for Pandora Premium if you can't play my music"
7832,Pandora,Terry Shrives,2,0,"I'm about to just cancel my subscribtion. Everytime I download it, it starts eating battery life like it's going out of style. It don't matter if it's running or not. Uninstalling it don't work either. I have to do a factory reset everytime, and I'm just not willing to do it anymore. Does the same thing with my kindle fire. Was a great app."
7833,Pandora,randy cunningham,1,10,How many times do I have to skip or thumbs down LIVE tracks before they STOP PLAYING THEM. They are from all the bands I love but I dont care for live recordings STOP!!!
7834,Pandora,A Google user,5,10,free pandora is awsome. they give the chance to watch ads in exchange for skips or to listen to full albums. but paying for pandora is the way to go if you travel and/ or lose connection. unlimited skips and offline use are worth it along with the ability to play any song at any time.
7835,Pandora,morgan's asmr,1,0,it doesn't work!!!!!!!!!!!!ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡

7842,Pandora,Adam Gray,1,0,A little upset right now as I can not cancel my Pandora Subsription. When I go to pandora to cancel it says my Google play account manages the subscription. When I go to my Google play account it says there are zero subscriptions. I had it set up through my paypal however i no longer use paypal since Pandora was the only thing set up with it. I deleted the subscription on there about a week ago and deleted my paypal account. Now Pandora is emailing me that i owe them money for a reaccuring subscription and I literally have no way to cancel this. At this point I am getting frustrated to the point where I may just delete my account and find another music streaming company. I will update this rating if something is done to assist me with this. Otherwise I will leave  it and retain it for proof incase you guys decide to try to bill me for services that should be canceled but you do not allow customers to cancel once subscribed.
7843,Pandora,All Honesty,1,4,"My mother uses this app. 8 do not use it nor have I ever hand an opinion on it until now. It won't stop playing when I exit the app. Have to ""Force Stop"" it in the settings menu. Not a phone call I wanted to deal with. Fix this BS. This sort of thing doesn't happen due to a bug. You had to deliberately program it to do this."
7844,Pandora,anthony king,5,1,i wish there was a way i could remove a song from thumbprint station with hitting the dislike button. i'd like to still hear the song but not on thumbprint station (change genres of music alot)
7845,Pandora,Lonely Loli,1,12,"I would give this a 5 star but it recently pissed me off. For the past few months I have made a playlist of my favorite songs and I've been able to listen to it with no payment. Just this morning I was listening to it normally but I had to leave for school. When I got on it earlier, it said I had to pay for playlist listening even though I was able to earlier today. Please inform me whats wrong or fix it. Until then, I will keep my 1 star."
7846,Pandora,Taylor L.,2,7,I love pandora and always use it but for the past 3 weeks it says am error has occurred and to try another station. I've tried all of them. even the ones i haven't looked at in years. Please fix this issue asap. I'll give more stars once the issue is fixed.
7847,Pandora,Francisco Bermudez,2,1,"Overall is an OK app. The main reason for my raiting is that is constantly runs on the background eating battery, even after I disabled background process for it. When connected via Bluetooth it does not stop when disconnected and remain on the background even after closing the app. Have to force stop every time"
7848,Pandora,A Google user,1,65,Love the app and have used it for years but here recently music has just decided to stop and it will not let me give a thumbs up for new music. And now since i updated the app earlier today it was fine now its refusing to do anything. Would like to continue using the app if the problems get resolved
7849,Pandora,Lish Gehring,4,1,"I love that you are now offering pod casts however you need to work on the programming. It will replay the same pod cast that i just finished, if paused it will start it over. When one episode completes it will not play the next episode, jumps around to different seasons and sometimes will play a completely different cast. I really do love having this option but the features need some serious fixes. Please fix!"
7850,Pandora,FluffyCloud,5,4,"Love this app! It's nice that it shows the lyrics so I can follow along, has a lot of songs, but I wish it could do the mixed songs. Like 'Ghosts' and 'Believer'. It would be nice, this app is great though."

7856,Pandora,Jennifer Adams,1,2,I love this app and listen to it all the time I stuck by you even when you decided to put a 40 hour limit and made people buy it and once you're past 40 hours you couldn't listen anymore I stuck with you then you get bought out by Sirius and now you pull yourself off of the entune app for Toyota and just made my life hell but if you think for a minute that I'm going to buy Sirius just cuz you took it off the entune app you're seriously nuts I'll find another one to listen to and dumped you both.
7857,Pandora,Jordan H,3,15,It's cool if u want to literally hear the same music on the same stations every time. And don't thumbs up a song because it will play it everytime you start the station. It's like a top 40 radio station but it's a top 20 for each genre.
7858,Pandora,Chris N.,2,15,STILL getting the same persistent notification issue as everyone else. I end up just force closing the app just to get it to go away. This has been going on for a while now but the update on 12-14-18 did *not* fix it.

Don't get me started on the crappy song suggestion, I don't listen too or play, or speak Korean & Latin, yet somehow that's the only music, 2 American channels play now, then repeats The same 5 or 6 songs American songs.... Pandora is beginning to suck, which is pushing me closer to search for a new music provider .... I don't want to hear Latin music the whole time I listen to ""today's hits"" which is (99%) of the music playing. I've changed channel and still have nothing but Latin suggestions.."

7868,Pandora,Anthony Keydel,3,1,"DON'T RELY ON THIS FOR TRAVELING sure there are 'offline stations' but you can't choose which ones, and worse, they don't work if you're connected to the internet in a country that ""doesn't support Pandora"" - A workaround I've found is to disable internet, then manually switch to offline mode. And cross your fingers hoping it plays through the error message you'll get Also 'close all apps' includes Pandora which sucks coming from Google music"
7869,Pandora,David Dasen,3,0,"I use Pandora daily, love the custom radio stations, but the Pandora app on my Chevy MyLink (factory radio in my Equinox) is broken - it's grayed out most of the time, so I have to use it through Bluetooth audio. Apparently this is a known issue. If this worked consistently I would probably pay for premium, but if they dont fix it I may end up giving my money to Spotify"
7870,Pandora,Brent McDonald,5,251,The agression of coding for choice of music lyrics to relate song to is amazing.. Quality and connection of music stream is fantastic. In Australia I've been using Pandora and related services since the integration of sony car stero devices until the music licence for Australia was decomissioned leaving Millions of uneducated technology users left with no alternative option... Come on Australia Make us Great again..
7871,Pandora,A Google user,1,5,"Since the new update, it doesn't work as well, and keeps saying I need a connection... well sitting next to my router, with full bars doesn't appear to be ""a good enough connection"". It was a great app til now."

7874,Pandora,Max Belanger,1,2,"The app is great until you pay for premium. Download songs un-download (the same day), play lists comprised of 100%downloaded music wont play offline, just randomly crashed when making playlists, etc. Basically this is a product that works free but breaks when you pay them."
7875,Pandora,Antonio Freitas,1,1,"Hi, Since I applied the last update I have not been able to handle Pandora from my 2015 honda accord app. I can not skip a song, like or unlike a song. I hope that Pandora will fix this situation soon before decide to delete it from my phone."
7876,Pandora,A Google user,5,0,"I still love Pandora after 9 years. It knows what I like, let's me download / no ads / higher sound quality, for me paying a little for a music app sure beats buying CDs! Pandora is hard to quit after all this time, although it is no longer my only music listening app. And I used to use Pandora Plus but upgraded to Premium, as I'm often without internet on weekends. (If the app's getting glitchy I will just pass on the update because mine's working just fine!). I will probably never quit Pandora."
7877,Pandora,A Google user,2,5,POS ap keeps telling me my station is not curently available and to pick another one. I will but unfortunatly for Pandora it will be on Spotify. At least Spotify doesn't keep trying to play groups nobody has heard of over and over... I'm so sick of this BS. Uninstall...

7887,Pandora,A Google user,5,8,Thank you for fixing the app!

7889,Pandora,Tiffany Cope,2,1,"This used to be my favorite way to listen to music, but for the last several weeks, it's been buffering SO much and skipping songs I want to hear. I'm hoping it's something that's being worked on. Otherwise I'm going to end up canceling my subscription because there's no sense in paying for something that isn't working correctly."
7890,Pandora,A Google user,3,0,"pretty good app, I prefer to use over iheart radio because, they don't have so much ads, or junk that look like ads on their app, its straightforward, no many clicks to get to where u want. HOWEVER, I don't really like to much, they play comedy in the same loop for years, I listen to PG comedy, it's the same jokes same comedians everytime. recently they did add Brian regan's brother, which was funny. but it was only 1 joke."
7891,Pandora,Jay Bandle,1,0,"i used to love Pandora, unlike most of the reviews here my complaint is with the app itself. I will continue to use it on my computer and tv, but the app randomly opens on my phone in the background. The only wat i see it is the notification bar but it will not close unless force stopped and uses an insane amount of battery for nothing, its not playing or streaming just chilling. ive tried reinstalling mutipule time playing with permissions and all with no fix. Hope yall fix it. till then bye."
7892,Pandora,Andy Moldenhauer,5,1,I have always loved Pandora. However it recently recommended Justin Bieber to me. I considered dropping the app for that alone. If it continues to make recommendations that are this far off base the rating will reflect it's poor choices.
7893,Pandora,A Google user,3,0,"Pandora Premium: I enjoy the music selection and the unlimited skips/replays/ability to make playlists. However I don't like the app itself: artists aren't in alphabetical order unless in a certain list, the playlist editing is unclear when downloading songs (what do all the symbols mean?). Overall, the music service itself is good, but the app needs vast improvement."
7894,Pandora,James Roscoe,1,6,"Upgraded to premium family, went into search. Initially only got errors. now that's fixed, but i can't figure out how to get back to my stations! WTH is wrong with the programmers, this interface is incredibly obtuse."

7902,Pandora,Evan Muschinske,2,1,"I'm not sure why I kept it so long; the offline mode simply stopped working after a while (even tried uninstalling/reinstalling it). Even with 4.99 a month you still occasionally get ads, and there is still a skip limit."
7903,Pandora,Nicholas,5,4,"Recently was inspired to create a rating. Per recent update, calendar month/year listened, is attached to stations within Pandora app. It now tells ""Listened [date]"". I just wanted to throw my opinion in the bunch and tell all of the developers how big this little addition really is! It's stellar to see when stations were last listened to -- it jogs your memory and really makes you think about the past. Love the feature, thanks devs!"
7904,Pandora,Gino Fiorani,1,0,I've had this app for years and added onto the same channel. I've noticed the likes on some of my songs have been disappearing. I liked them for a reason can you stop getting rid of them they are part of the music I want to hear.
7905,Pandora,Jehuty Rivera,1,1,"could be the best app if it would allow me to fwd when it goes into ""autoplay"" I dont want to pay to listen to the whole intro of a song I may not like. I just switched from spotify this may be a show stopper for me from this free trial."

Please, make it an option in the app to stop the album art from appearing on the lockscreen."
7908,Pandora,E. Piero,2,6,"The offline music that u have to pay for, is terrible. U can get a whole playlist that doesn't match any of your songs, and go disliking the whole playlist and have nothing to listen to, until the app decides to update itself randomly."
7909,Pandora,big worm,1,3,"Too many ads now. Ive used Pandora for well over 10 years. I am done, you get an ad between each song while pop ups spam you. I used to sit at my pc for hours enjoy music now i can barely stand 1 song. You are better of just using an old fashioned radio at this point. Even if you buy premium you still get ads. I guess I'll try Spotify. Ihearts about the same as Pandora but available on more platforms. Its just a shame to lose so many Playlist I've worked so hard on.:'("

7942,Pandora,Rex Moon,1,11,I dont understand having stations of a particular artist if you cant listen to them. I tried a aerosmith station. 15 songs were not even related. So much so that ibfoumd the skip limit on the free premium trial. If want to listen to someone i want to hear their music not Avenged Sevenfold. Stick to Slacker or Youtube.
7943,Pandora,Jim Wray,3,13,Sometimes the app just turns on by itself and starts playing music. This is really not acceptable. I was in a meeting and suddenly my phone just started blasting music and I couldn't get it turned off for what felt like forever. Another time I was asleep in bed and it just started playing from out of nowhere. It was really bad. I am going to uninstall Pandora because I can not have that happen. Please correct this issue.

Theres alot of ads and the interface is old out dated and looks like something from the early 90's almost appears as if it was made the same era that Napster was created. Create a new interface, chill with the ads ever other song, stop the crashes and make the updates actually update something and it will be a solid app."
7954,Pandora,Jess Jones,1,1,All this app does is crash anymore.
7955,Pandora,A Google user,1,6,"Cancelling the subscription seems impossible. My billing date started on the 28th and 3 months later, I'm billed the 22nd. They slowly work the date forward each month."
7956,Pandora,Honey Suckinaw,5,3,enjoy this app all the time.
7957,Pandora,David Rounds,5,1,the best way to listen to all your greatest favorite hits for music.

7959,Pandora,David Mitchell,5,0,"Yea, can't enough the best music around. Just love Pandora!!!!"
7960,Pandora,Alon Hillel-Tuch,2,5,new update makes it impossible to close Pandora. it just keeps in the background and in notification bar. Even when hitting x close in notifications it stays running. Only way to stop it is force stop
7961,Pandora,Amber Chamlis,4,1,"I love Pandora, but my fiance and I sometimes have to battle to listen to it. It only allows one person to listen to it at a time. They need to Fix that already! I would pay a few dollars more to have 2 listeners!!"
7962,Pandora,Taneshia Jones,1,0,"We are paying for the same songs to be on repeat and no commercials, the no commercials are a plus. Thats' my reason for one star. I know it's my choice to keep paying and listening, but a 9 hour work day with different music will definitely be great, knowing how much music is out there."
7963,Pandora,Ben Hanson,3,1,would be better if it didn't close out if I'm on the phone for over a minute it should start back up after I hang up if I walk out of Bluetooth range and then come back while I'm at work I don't want to have to open the app again to waste of time and annoying please give an option to always leave Pandora in the background paused like before
7964,Pandora,A Google user,4,0,"I liked it pretty good, but it does have a lot of adds, and although im pretty sure you can turn emails off, this app gave me 5 emails a day asking me to open it and listen to so-and-so station."
7965,Pandora,Jacob Ferem,4,1,"Great app, been using pandora one for years to eliminate the ads but just recently after the last update I keep getting an error message. What's going on pandora? I'm not paying for error messages. Please fix soon."
7966,Pandora,Rick Dean Sr.,2,13,"unless you want to pay for the premium to get all options, you have to put up with commercials. With other apps you don't have to be bothered with them. and I'm having problems with the music cutting in and out, or when i get a phone call it doesn't start back up."
7967,Pandora,Kenya Graham,4,2,This version won't leave the notification area even though it's closed and swiped out of memory. You have to force stop or turn off all notifications for it to clear out of the notification area. Fix that please!
7968,Pandora,Sasha Wangerow,5,1,"What happened to my Bookmarked tracks!?!?! Like what the F**** is the point of having it there if you cant access them later. Screw you guys,I'm cancelling my premium account. You guys sure want to act like spotify but your app and ypur whoke progam is garbage anymore."
7969,Pandora,A Google user,4,0,I aiways have a good experience listening to Pandora App.

7973,Pandora,LeAnn N,1,0,"couldnt access pandora on any of my devices. also make it almost impossible to cancel a subscription. switching to spotify because i need music for work with no ads. **** since pandora responded**** tried that and the pandora website was NOT working, this is a low quality app"

7975,Pandora,A Google user,5,2,love that my fav song comes on just at the right time!
7976,Pandora,Mike Martin,1,7,garbage. hope you like no variety and horrid track lists. biggest waste of memory ever. oh and let's interrupt a commercial to hear a message from the artist? almost as stupid as the guy who thought this was a music app
7977,Pandora,Lindsey Gallegos,2,0,"It's okay but it frustrates me when I can't download offline music. I'll try to, but the app ends up crashing. Anything that I'll try to download won't even download, it'll just stay with the icon with the arrows. I spent a whole day waiting for it to download but it didn't work ðŸ¤·â€â™€ï¸"
7978,Pandora,night life,1,4,"I used pandora a lot to discover new music a while ago. The ratings went down since then. Same good interface, however the amount of ads then force onto you is extreme. I see they got greedier since I've been away."
7979,Pandora,Christopher Jason Barr,1,3,Expect 3 minutes of ads every 2nd song unless you pay. It was never that bad when I first started using pandora many years ago but they need to increase their profits somehow I guess. I'll get my music elsewhere.
7980,Pandora,Don Gillespie,5,1,over the years it has grew on me
7981,Pandora,Lady J,4,1,"I think we should be allowed to put a song on repeat or start it over, on the app. Logging in to the website allows it. Other than that, I'm good. The app never lets me down, even when ""GPS signal is lost."" lol"
7982,Pandora,A Google user,5,2,It's a great app and the ads are doable meaning there not real loud like on TV and not excessive.Of course theres going to be people that think that any ads at all are excessive. One question though.Why do you have ads during Sleep Radio?
7983,Pandora,A Google user,5,0,lovit. the sound quality is crystal clear
7984,Pandora,Natallie Angeles,5,0,it is very great to listen to music on this app

7990,Pandora,A Google user,3,1,"Every other update the app will not connect to my car stereo. I can restart the app, check and uncheck the ""connect to car"" box in the advanced settings, etc. It wasn't like this about a year ago."
7991,Pandora,Gregory Hess,4,5,"This app is awesome for when you just want to turn on music and listen on the fly. However, I do notice that once you start a station and listen to the bulk of songs that come on, you notice that the songs get repeated. This makes you tired of the songs in such a short time."
7992,Pandora,John Laywell,2,7,I had premium. it wouldn't let me update my subscription to the family plan or access my subscription at all. The offline listening sucks. Just keeps giving you a message across your screen saying you dont have service.
7993,Pandora,Seth Naquin,2,5,Overall I've had a great experience with the app. But after the last update nothing has worked at all no station will load up. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app and logged off and relogged in with nothing changing please fix this please. I use this app for work and for when I go to bed.
7994,Pandora,Chris OConnor,1,5,"Recent update has made this app my highest battery consumer, even though I rarely even open it anymore on my phone. Constantly Force Closing this dang app. I'm on the verge of uninstalling and using Spotify and Play Music exclusively. Pandora's updates are frustrating."
7995,Pandora,Andy McGarr,1,4,"this used to be my favorite music app, but now that sirius xm took over they put so many ads that i can only skip one song before its asking for me to watch another video, yall used to care, now your just looking for a quick buck and not giving a damn about how we feel, please, just cool it with the ads..."
7996,Pandora,Emily Radue,1,17,"i would give a higher rating as up until this last week i have used the app frequently. over the past week i have lost use completely. app tells me upon start up that 'this content is not available offline' which is bs because i have pandora plus so i can listen to offline content. then when i click ok it starts to load only to tell me there is no connection. i have unlimited 4g and i have tried connecting to home wifi without getting pandora to connect, it keeps saying it can't. never loads"
7997,Pandora,Allison Elizabeth,1,2,"They won't stop nagging me about installing the app. Everytime I try to register they won't let me. I'm sick and tired of them pestering me with this stupid app. Besides, I can just listen to music on YouTube. Ugh!"
7998,Pandora,Jo Croom,3,7,"Works pretty well and has very little issues, but could use some improvements. Most users would probably like the addition of an equalizer and the ability to organize their library by title, artist, album etc."
7999,Pandora,A Google user,5,0,it good but i cant go no were and lessin to my rap or a song far way tho plz fix it
8000,Pandora,Isidro Cruz,1,0,i have been using Pandora for about five years and the feature that I like the most is the Pandora premium that you could use after watching an ad but now that feature is useless since Pandora restricted most of the songs so I ask i know I speak for most who use that feature that we get to listen to the songs that were blocked from our satisfaction
8001,Pandora,Lindsay Ingram,4,1,it works great now thank you!
8002,Pandora,Felix Villa,5,1,ENDLESS BEAUTIFUL MUSIC PRESENT AND PAST AT YOUR FINGERTIPS

8005,Pandora,A Google user,5,0,i love it!! best radio ever!!
8006,Pandora,Lucy Wagner,1,43,"Since last update, app opens on its own but won't let me close it. Notification shows Pandora open, playing unknown. Will not allow me to swipe or use x to close it. Rather annoying. Almost enough to make me uninstall"
8007,Pandora,Tiffany Wilhelm,2,3,"After a recent update, the app will no longer sync with my car, which has a Pandora button on the music controls. It's very disappointing."
8008,Pandora,Karen Weller,1,4,"used to love this app and listen to it every single day and night. since todays update now i cant use it. it tries to load and then crashes. so disappointing since i use it all day, every day."
8009,Pandora,A Google user,1,11,"HATE IT! I downloaded this app for nothing. I mean when they siad they ""FIXED CRASHES AND ERRORS"" I don't think so, and everytime I wanna listen to music it just freezes there. Also there are way wayyy to many ads so I hope that you guys fix this!"
8010,Pandora,JO W,2,7,Not worth the trouble if listening to the music. Stays in notification bar and won't let me close it. Please fix where I can exit app and I may try again...if Bluetooth is on you cannot close it even when it's not connected to anything. Right now I'm to the point of uninstalling.
8011,Pandora,John Trivilino,1,2,"Pandora auto-starts as I flip past an advertisement on flipboard. If this keeps up, I will delete Pandora. I do not like apps starting up on their own. It usually happens at very inopportune times."
8012,Pandora,Jeremy Curtis,5,0,"pandora allows you to play your music and by playing other music, of which pandora seems to play all the right songs and I have used Pandora for atleast 2 yrs. It would be great to have a, play this song, function."
8013,Pandora,Keith Kedzuch,1,12,I just did the update and since right before doing the update and even after the update. My pandora refuses to connect to a connection. Please fix what you broke. I already have a year subscription so THATS not the issue. I even uninstalled and reinstalled but that didn't fix the issue either.
8014,Pandora,Richard Maxey,5,0,great way to unwind with your favorite artists
8015,Pandora,John McCutchen,5,0,very good that's amusing that you can put down

8019,Pandora,Dale Cratty,3,1,"It's been pretty good, you get a good selection of songs, but the ads are getting way to frequent. It almost forces one to buy the premium; every 2 to 3 songs there's 2 or 3 ads. Ridiculous..."
8020,Pandora,Stephanie Griffin,2,2,"It's 12/1/2018 and I use to love Pandora. But since there new update, it doesn't work well and I can't listen to more then 2 songs before something happens and it shuts off. Please fix this developer's."
8021,Pandora,Vaneshia Vallery,3,3,My Pandora has been tripping. It's just skipping through everything song on the station. I uninstalled it for about 2 weeks and just installed it and it's doing the same thing skipping through songs.
8022,Pandora,Cactus Man,3,3,"I like being able to listen to music. However when I renewed my subscription the app began to plummet in quality due to a major glitch. It cant download albums, well it barely can. Album pictures are flickering, some songs refuse to download, at one point I actually had to force stop the app on several occasions, I tried reinstalling the app but that only partially fixed the problem. I'm not sure what's happening but its hindering my ability to listen to music. Everything was fine until I renewed my subscription. I expect an update to arrive to fix this. I should mention that some albums could be downloaded with problems but ones I had previously won't."
8023,Pandora,Chris Jeffers,3,59,"After the Nov 1, 2018 update my app crashes and will not reopen after minimizing the app or after making a call and attempting to reopen the app. I have to uninstall the app everytime for the error to clear. Samsung S9+."
8024,Pandora,Jhanny Quesada,1,1,"I pay for premium so I can listen to what I want and have unlimited skips, but now I'm stuck listening to a crappy version. Of boeheim rhapsody from some band I have no idea who they are , because licensing restrictions what b.s is this"
8025,Pandora,A Google user,2,2,"i love this app but annoyingly EVERYTIME I open it it closes on its own after a few songs. I've had it on the past hour and it closes out in the middle of songs, been about 4-5 times already. please fix this issue.."

8027,Pandora,kayleigh harris,1,6,"Whatever update you just did is garbage. No stations will play, no songs will play. it just isn't working at all. So conveniently after I just got pawned into paying $10 for a ""free trial"". What a scam. 0 Stars."
8028,Pandora,A Google user,4,0,OK so I have downloaded this app so I could listen to music on the go I have premium but every time I turn on online even though I have downloaded stations it says no stations are downloaded so it's still a good app but maybe if it would let me listen online it would be a lot better.

PLEASE REFUND MY MONEY AND CANCEL SUBSCRIPTION ' SOOOOO ANNOYED BY THIS!"
8034,Pandora,A Google user,4,0,its fun because you can play any song you want
8035,Pandora,A Google user,2,3,I love this app because you can listen to anything you want but for some reason I haven't been able to get on Pandora because every time I try to get on it IT LEGIT GLITCHES ME OFF and it's so frustrating because I can't ever listen to music and this app is the only so that lets you listen to whatever you want
8036,Pandora,Frank Brotherton,5,0,I want buy pandora prime. my old debit card was cancelled .
8037,Pandora,A Google user,5,1,5 STARS!!! All the way best music streaming/radio stations app out there. It's cool I can just watch an ad and get unlimited skips and song picks for an hour. Then I can do it again once the hour is up!
8038,Pandora,christy aragon,4,1,"Well I have the plus membership I love this app and use it often however. I'm not too happy about having no choice but to listen to the ""Clean Version"" of some songs I'm over 18 and pay for this service."
8039,Pandora,April Doty,3,0,"first off, i never pay for app subsriptions i always opt for the free apps. this time i decided to try it out and was considering actually continuing my subscription after my trial ended if pandora premium was as great as it promised to be. problem is i got the trial on google play store and have tried on playstore, the app and the internet to restore the trial purchase to my pandora account and i have yet to enjoy a single day of it!"
8040,Pandora,Panchito Pantera,2,2,"Hate that everytime i receive or make a call or pause the music for more than 30 seconds the app closes and have to restart it.. every single time, i dont know if it happens on every phone but mine has trouble with the app (galaxy s9)"

8051,Pandora,A Google user,2,0,Was highly disappointed; try the trial version and paid with Google pay but did not like the premium version at all as it did not really give much extra and I'm still trying to cancel the subscription. Have written several emails and followed every tutorial I can find to cancel but I'm still having difficulties.
8052,Pandora,Jesus Porfirio,5,0,"I would give 5 stars if the scrubber worked properly. When I move it backwards, it ""buffers"" to a completely different song. Please fix in the next update for 5 stars"
8053,Pandora,Savannah Adams,1,134,Would have given it 5 stars 4 days ago when I last used it but I turned it of in offline mode and now just turning the app on it tell me this content or action is available in offline mode... even tried uninstalling and reinstalling and it continues to tell me the same thing. stupid
8054,Pandora,Ryan Rawlings,3,2,"Docking one star for not being able to download podcasts. I'd rather not waste my data on streaming audio that could be downloaded. Docking another star for not being able to shuffle a selection of stations. in this aspect, the paid app is LESS functional than the ad supported version. I don't want Christmas music in my mix, nor do I want a steady diet of Daft Punk, but these are the only options currently available. Will not be continuing past the free trial"
8055,Pandora,Juan Covarrubias,1,16,"I am paying for pandora plus, and I do not see the point. the feature to download music to listen online does not work, whats the point of downloading music for offline if you cant even get on the app without it informing you that you have to be onlime TO EVEN USE IT. And now pandora just xompletely stopped working, gets stuck on the loading screen. waist of money USE SPOTIFY!!!"

8060,Pandora,A Google user,4,3,its great but i really wanted a app that plays music withoit usong wifi or data so i came to pandora but i can only use it with wifi or data and i really dont like that so of you can try to fix this it would be amazing and probably more people would download the app please make it wifi and data free
8061,Pandora,SOG BlackPlague,1,1,"App constantly freezes, constant crashes, i can't pause the music because the moment i do the app crashes, if i try to change stations it freezes, it used to never do this but now it's constant, and as of now 12/31/18 i noticed that there is no cursing in the music, no options to change it so im done using pandora, i want to hear cursing not constant points of no vocals"
8062,Pandora,A Google user,3,2,Paying premium. Have always LOVED pandora in the past. But for whatever reason I CANNOT get it to stop stopping after 15 seconds. Seriously. Did an update. No help. Am going to delete premium.
8063,Pandora,Dawn Blaskovich,4,1,Not sure why but recently havent been able to properly shut down the app. Whether in the app or closing the app from my list of running apps it just keeps playing. The only way I'm able to shut it down is shutting off the phone or going into my apps manager and forcing the stop
8064,Pandora,Laketa Wilson,4,3,i want my music that I had .
8065,Pandora,A Google user,3,1,"Could be a lot better. Too many ads, and no way to see what's going to play next, so you can thumbs down garbage before it plays. Would also like to see a function for thumbs down on an artist as a whole."

8104,Pandora,Karen Stein,5,0,it plays a lot of the songs I like and is so easy to use
8105,Pandora,Joshua Ford,1,11,"have loved this app up until the recent update. I can now longer search for stations, download music on premium, and it keeps bringing up errors. hopefully they fix it soon, or I will just go to spotify or Google music"
8106,Pandora,Stacii 7827,5,0,love it ðŸ˜ just thumbs up some of your favorite songs and it will find you some more jams....
8107,Pandora,ashley moreland,1,1,been crashing a lot with an error code
8108,Pandora,Dustin Bowen,2,4,Stop asking me to upgrade for f***s sake. How many times do I have to say no before you guys get the message. I'm getting very close to deleting this app in favor of spotify.
8109,Pandora,Jeffrey Laird,3,301,"It works great on my android phone, BUT WILL NOT CONNECT TO MY KENWOOD IN THE TRUCK. The last update did something that made it now it will not connect to the radio. WHY?????"
8110,Pandora,Pratip Bagchi,1,3,"I had a free one before it was okay and  have recently switched to premium subscription  to try it out and I am hugely disappointed. Looks like Pandora team released the premium app without even proper testing as no one uses it. Every time I get a phone call or make a phone call app completely stops playing. Where every other app resume it from where it stopped. This is is heck lot of problematic when I am driving. Every time I take or make a call using my car Bluetooth, I have to reopen the Pandora app and start it again. This makes my driving distracted and uncomfortable.   Worst part of the whole thing if I am listening to Radio and middle of a song I am enjoying, the whole Radio plays from fresh.I loose the song I was listening to."
8111,Pandora,Judy Marin,5,0,I can have all the music that I like for free!!
8112,Pandora,A Google user,5,1,Been listening to Pandora for couple years now it has got me though a lot of tough days and nights working lift me up when I'm down smooth ilistening tryna get to sleep wake me up some morning it there when I don't want to be bothered with people. I love Pandora.
8113,Pandora,A Google user,1,1,"What the hell am I paying for, crashes on WiFi, takes multiple tries to open and play music, takes for ever to load, phone brand new, the service use to be great. Not worth a penny now, moving to YouTube red"
8114,Pandora,Chastity Garrison-Williams,2,1,"when I first started listening to pandora the app was working fine. now I'm having the app shutdown after I pause the music. when I open it back up, it started popping up errors which closed the app."
8115,Pandora,A Google user,5,3,just started with Pandora music satisfied so far
8116,Pandora,A Google user,1,0,very slow and pause a lot even when I have good service

8118,Pandora,Gordon Costanzo,5,0,life is good again with PANDORA!!!
8119,Pandora,theresa prioli,5,0,thanks so much for the update
8120,Pandora,Katie Smith,1,2,It won't show the music screen on my lock screen and it is all of a sudden been buffering a lot when it hadn't been. I reached out and they sure wasn't any help if y'all can help out soon that be awesome but may have to cancel my premium membership and check out spotify.
8121,Pandora,Kenny Harvey,5,0,"Generally quite good. Sometimes has trouble in areas with inconsistent internet connection (if you can't open the app, you can't enable ""offline mode""). Overall, I like the variety of recommended songs, and the app works well on Android."
8122,Pandora,Garrett Mann,2,2,"App decides to open a notification randomly that cannot be cleared without going into the app, starting it up, and then shutting down the app... Only to bring the notification back up shortly after on its own."
8123,Pandora,Keenchin Nesto,5,1,I love that when pretty much any new album from a popular artist I like gets released I can hear it from start to finish. Not a fan of not being able to stream a lot of older music except for on random radio streaming only rather than being able to play everything but all in all I am happy and I will definitely continue to pay for Pandora Premium access.
8124,Pandora,Colby Era,1,1,Update your algorithms. If i thumbs down a song i do not want the next song to be the acoustical version. Now you just make it hard to cancel subscription. Not a sustainable business model.
8125,Pandora,Alberto Baez,1,0,Premium? Skips songs when I unlock my phone. I try to replay the ones skipped and it skips two more. Dims on some songs even though feature is off. What am I paying for? Please fix or unsubscribing and going to Spotify.

8128,Pandora,tim C,1,6,"I've begun to pay for pandora now, and I believe your reaching out and varying my stations too much. When I want to listen to an artists radio, I want their songs! I tried a Patsy Cline station and it was like 1 in 25 ish was one of her songs. :( Then to boot, your varying the kind of music too far from the artist. For example from Patsy you play a Red hot chili peppers song. :( Work your algorithm better please."
8129,Pandora,Amber Jennings,1,0,My Pandora stops working any time i skip a song or change the station with my Android Auto. Really disappointed in the new update. I've used Pandora for years and hate to think i have to find other options.
8130,Pandora,Heavenly Luseni,5,1,i can listen to any music i want
8131,Pandora,Red Nation,3,0,can't figure out how to get the plan
8132,Pandora,littlefeet13,1,0,app badge stuck in notifications and still fix has worked.
8133,Pandora,George Allen,4,0,"My only complaint is too difficult to exit it or shut it down. Touching the X on the Android pull down from the top of the screen does not work. Clear all apps does not work. I have to force stop it in settings. Come on Pandora, make it easy to shut down!"
8134,Pandora,timaera gales,3,1,Error messages often and turns off after pausing
8135,Pandora,Levi Borrowman,2,2,The constant notification on my home screen has not gone away even with the most recent update. The only way to kill the home screen notification is to force stop it. Please fix the issue.
8136,Pandora,David Lehmann,3,3,It keeps playing the same songs. E.g my film score channel repeatedly plays pirates of the Caribbean. I would like a setting to specify the number of days before a song is repeated.
8137,Pandora,Alaxamber LutÃºce,5,3,I have Prime and love it. Downloading a station on downloads 5 songs so don't think a long cantrip with a few stations downloaded will be fun. You will here the same 5songs over and over. BUT you can download CDs which is flipping amazing.
8138,Pandora,Mako Heiwajima,2,1,"enjoy, it kind of. you cant pause it and then open another app and come back to same song. it's really frustrating. 2 stars is very l enient"
8139,Pandora,A Google user,2,1,I really enjoyed Pandora for a long time and now that I got a new phone this app has been nothing but a bunch of problems. It never wants to load when I need it and tell me to contact Pandora support yet it's a brand new phone! if it doesn't change soon I guess I'll have deleted my account like I did Facebook.
8140,Pandora,Kay Gooden,1,1,"The subscription is a joke! has nothing worth listening to to download, won't let you cancel unless you have a computer, and then doesn't even cancel, still charges your account and send you into the negatives because IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO CHARGE! If you want to get screwed over use this app."
8141,Pandora,A Google user,5,0,i just downloded it but i think it will be good
8142,Pandora,sarah leighton,2,0,your new update blows. the app wont let me play anything ive saved or downloaded none of my playlist and i wasnt experiencing problems until the last update. please fix my issue im tired of paying for a service that doesnt work right .

8146,Pandora,A Google user,5,1,I can listen to my favorite music on this app I love this app there's only one thing I wish there wasn't any ads on the app cause they take for ever so I forget what song I want to listen to I wish there wasn't any ads on the app I love this app
8147,Pandora,Lily land,1,0,im absolutely sick of the fact that i cant have the app playing with anything else. it constantly closes and i have to go back open it and it completely skips the song i was just listening too. its so beyond annoying to the point im deleting it. i dont have the issue with spotify so they will be getting my money.
8148,Pandora,Cali kelly,5,2,i like it a lot u should get it
8149,Pandora,Jerrald Glaser,2,6,"Needs Bluetooth update, playlists always restart when minimizing app. Answering a call makes Pandora freeze and restart, this is so annoying, especially because I pay for Pandora. I hope Pandora realises these huge flaws before Spotify completely takes over."
8150,Pandora,John T,4,0,"Music mix was good! But changing subscription options is a hassle, costing me unnecessary $! F U Pandora, I'll go back to the FREE radio. And YOU'RE WELCOME for the $ you stole from me (sarcmasm)."
8151,Pandora,Brenna Berry,1,0,"I've had pandora for a long time and it's just gotten worse and worse. The back to back ads, playing the same 5 songs over and over. The final straw is the censoring. Previously uncensored songs are now being censored. I'm finally done with pandora."
8152,Pandora,Ehran Owens,1,0,gay song tell lose skips the add then the in ten min put on the song that skip before add
8153,Pandora,Curran Shoulders,4,1,"While Pandora does have a wider variety (especially from non mainstream artists), I don't think the music made available for download to paying subscribers is enough. Otherwise, it's a more than decent music App. Free version isn't bad either."
8154,Pandora,Desi Stine,1,0,"Too many ads from free apps, one is preventing me from using my phone for 5 seconds because of tick tock ad wanting me to download but 2ads overtop it but when i cant accept a extremely important call because of it all apps w ads out my phone. I was willing to try the app but never did because every several minutes I have ads stopping me from using my phone so I'm done w any app w ads because it's too many in a hour, should be a limited number or pay a fee for no ads"
8155,Pandora,Randi Boyd,5,6,"Love Pandora Premium! It would be nice to be able to have more than one person use it at once, though. So we can share the playlists, stations, etc. Like a couple's account."
8156,Pandora,Johnnie Simpson,5,0,I was surprised that Pandora could find and play songs from almost any artist of any genre. I love it. I don't understand those that complain about ads.We listen to radio with ads.
8157,Pandora,Dilan Gilluly,1,0,"App is now crashing back to the launcher on the constant while playing on my OnePlus 6 using a bluetooth speaker. No way to report bugs in app, going to the help section prompts me to cancel my subscription. I might just do that! App developers delete any feedback on their social media pages as well!"
8158,Pandora,Denise Gosvener,5,0,im jus giving this a gucci rate cuz im wanting it to download faster...awesome app

8163,Pandora,A Google user,5,1,This was amazing. you get to pick all the songs you want and make new playlists for thesongs you wany! they update so quickly too! New song... BAM!
8164,Pandora,Physco Undertale Fanatic Wraith,4,0,"It is very good with giving music that is close to your other music, playing the playlist you make and putting you to sleep the thing is though mine will play two or three songs from my playlist, and then I have to switch back to my playlist from a random song."
8165,Pandora,A Google user,2,0,"Very flakey with chromecast. Often my speakers don't appear in the cast icon, or the icon is completely missing. Fails to connect much of the time. And often fails to connect to the Pandora server via wifi... have to go and load a webpage in a browser first to ""prime"" the wifi engine for Pandora."
8166,Pandora,Angela Owens,2,2,My biggest issue is I don't get the songs from the artist of the station I created. The same songs are played over and over and it's annoying. I find myself skipping songs and clicking the thumbs down.
8167,Pandora,A Google user,5,1,I have all my music it is great
8168,Pandora,Scott Shields,2,1,"Constantly have to toggle ""launch from car"" to get it to work with infotainment apps. Attempting to do this while driving is dangerous with all the obtrusive popups every time you open up Pandora. Switching to Android Auto stopped being a solution as it is now stops playing songs after awhile until I switch stations. Clearing data and/or rebooting devices doesn't help. This issue keeps coming back every few app updates, making SiriusXM look more of a permanent solution."
8169,Pandora,Edward Rodriguez,2,0,I'm tired of it crashing every week. I'm switching to Spotify. I messed up my leg today and all I wanna do is listen to music without commercials and Pandora can't even find a data connection with the new update. I'm starting my music collection over on Spotify
8170,Pandora,Novina Ramos,3,1,"I'm kinda pissed with being unable to add good songs to my Playlist because of a licensing problem with my favorite artist (more specifically, Jack Conte) and two people can't listen at the same time on an account"

8184,Pandora,nraines89,4,3,"The app overall works well but after I close it out it stays open using up data and battery. I have to ""force stop"" the app to get it to move off of my notifications. (Samsung Galaxy Note 8)"
8185,Pandora,Bob Jones,1,0,is an absolute horrific and crashing software after incoming calls or pause Enoch doing something. when changing stations for the last year on a LG Stylo for it has been saying incurred an unknown error! didn't you design your apps that when it crashes or makes any problems does a feedback? I have gone to Google Play where it is 1000% more accurate better quality of choices and debility 2 as it stands pay for music compared to Pandora will you have to pay 7 bucks a month then you get your music.
8186,Pandora,Ms Tonya Anderson,2,4,"So far my free trial is not off to a good start. A cpl of times already, in the last three days, I can't get any music to play. I get an error that the station is currently unavailable. It tells me to choose another station but every station is unavailable. Laaaaaame. I doubt I'll keep my card on file to pay for this monthly. *Update: My gawd it's like every freakin day! This blows. Definitely not paying for this frustration. Off to subscribe to Spotify"
8187,Pandora,Armando Mendoza,1,2,The app shuts down all the time. If i pause it for more than a few seconds it shuts down. If i pause it to listen to a video or play my game for a few minutes it shuts down. If i disconnect my phone from Bluetooth to listen to Pandora on my phone it shuts down. I'm tired of having to restart the app several times a day.
8188,Pandora,Keith Meeks,1,1,this app sucks. it makes the mist simple tasks items you have to look up help videos on YouTube in order to accomplush them. try making a playlist. then try listening to it iff line. you can some how have all the songs on the playlist downloaded to your phone and it still will not let you lusten to it offline.
8189,Pandora,Kassin Yeates,1,0,will not do anything since last update.

8209,Pandora,Valkyrie Main,1,0,"The only people who actually like Pandora are the ones who haven't used Spotify. Also, Pandora in mythology is responsible for giving the entire world disease and death. Not really a relevant point, but not really a great marketing strategy."

8212,Pandora,Lady Reece House Spencer,2,1,This app would be awesome but it nwver stops running. The only way to stop it from killing your battery and randomly turning on is to force stop it from your android settings. Thats a huge battery waste.
8213,Pandora,A Google user,3,0,can you please stop this stupid app from turning on by itself all the time? It's been happening for two years now. I'll be standing in line in the grocery store and all of a sudden some death metal station I don't even have just turns on. This happens at least five times a day

8248,Pandora,Doug Hall,1,3,"very dissapointing. ive had pandora for years and it was always great about playing similar songs and changing it up. and i would rarely hear the same song twice in a day. but now, no matter what i do, each station plays the same 20-30 songs EVERYDAY. And im not exagerating. and they are only songs that i have liked or given thumbs up. but yet im not on thumbprint radio. im tired of it. pandora, please fix this. its making me want to buy my spotify and amazon music again."
8249,Pandora,Lisa Maes,5,2,I have been a longtime listener to Pandora. I have never been disappointed with the service. I hope have many more years of wonderful music to come. I am hardly ever without it. Thankyou!
8250,Pandora,alex Star,4,8,"I had the same issues that every one else was having with logging in. Kept saying no connection even with full service. But I found a fix, I had to go into my app storage and manually delete the data and storage. Then relog in. Works fine now"
8251,Pandora,Alicia Jones,2,1,"It'll play half of the songs then quit. If you open the app to figure out what's going on, it goes to the next song or plays an ad. I'm done. Even tried updating the app."
8252,Pandora,susan mazur,5,5,The music they play is excellent to all my choices of radio stations. I haven't put the $5 up so there's no commercials but it's not a big deal I still get more music than I get commercials. All in all I enjoy this app cuz it doesn't cost me anything
8253,Pandora,Lannie Schafroth,1,1,can't sort stations by name. this makes useless when in the vehicle. I'm not going to scroll through pages of stations while driving. bring back the sort function.
8254,Pandora,A Google user,4,1,This latest update is the best one in years.  It fixed a lot of issues with the app but introduced a new issue.  The app constantly runs in the background and will not close on my phone.

8263,Pandora,Rhesia Lewis,5,0,I love Pandora. I listen to it all day at work and at night. I think that it's affordable for a monthly membership for no commercials. I have several stations that are customized and I can skip or even replay most songs. I highly recommend it.
8264,Pandora,A Google user,1,1,horrible keeps crashng even though i have 4g lte. wont even let me open the app. not worth the time to fight with it. screen will freeze.
8265,Pandora,EchoTM,4,2,"For some reason when I go to use the app, it says it's not available in my country. I was confused and was wondering if I could get help. I live in the US so that is why it is confusing me. I did like the app though."
8266,Pandora,Tina Isgrigg,3,0,I used to really love Pandora but probably the last 6 months or so I have a problem just getting the app to open and play. I also pay for the premium version but thinking about stopping that because why pay for something that only works maybe half the time. Please fix and I'll change my review but right now Pandora sucks
8267,Pandora,A Google user,1,2,I have the premium 3 month free trail and they are trying to charge my credit card. I have reached out to support as soon as I heard from them I will update. I am not happy right now.

8271,Pandora,Jacob Spain,5,0,I like that Pandora Music introduces me to new music. I love it. The should not be a limit on skips tho. That is the main reason I exit the app.
8272,Pandora,Clifford Fitzgerald,1,2,"i want to cancel my subscription. pandora says cancel through Google play, can't find my subscription through google play at all. I WANT TO CANCEL THIS SUBSCRIPTION IMMEDIATELY PLEASE. THIS IS VERY VERY FRUSTRATING..."
8273,Pandora,carl mondesir,1,3,"They are many restrictions when it comes to play certain music with this app even when you pay 10 dollars a month for the premium version of the app. You can't listen to certain Eminem's album, some Future's album and some songs by the Wekeend....like the heck!!!ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜¡"
8274,Pandora,A Google user,1,2,"I liked it till, ads prompted me, and they stole my ""my choice"" from what i thought was only mine. It wasent even done yet!. I didnt like that i could'nt play music off line."

8276,Pandora,Nathanael Young,3,0,The app does its job well. Very simple layout and easy to use. The mobile version plays lots of ads though. I have Pandora on my computer and get about 1 ad every 5-10 songs. In the app it feels like another ad is played after 1 or 2 songs.
8277,Pandora,Donna Bradford,3,0,"I have been very happy with Pandora but something was mixed up since the last update. Keep getting an error message ""Pandora not responding"" although music continues to play, but unable to shut down app unless ""close app"" is chosen on the error message."
8278,Pandora,A Google user,1,6,This app is killing my battery life. It uses 20% of my battery per hour while I'm not even using it. It's running in the background and sucks all the life from my phone.
8279,Pandora,Chuck Gyurek,3,0,"Really pushes you to buy it , I came to Pandora so I culd listen to music. Don't mind the few commercials , but the constant hounding to buy drives me away. May go back to i heart or Spotify."
8280,Pandora,conrad deRuyter,1,2,"I've used Pandora since 2011, used to love it. However since the Sirius buyout the app has turned to trash. Constantly buffering, the song suggestions are horrible, and more adds than ever."

8290,Pandora,Casey Justice,3,0,I'm paying for pandora PREMIUM so I expect no commercials as advertised however there are ads and commercials. This is not what I'm paying $10 a month for. Please fix it or I will switch to another provider and cancel my subscription!

8307,Pandora,Dale Sunderlin,1,3,"Paid User, After having a (Holiday) station for years, Pandora apparently feels Music from my other stations belong on that station. Having to thumbs down songs on a station I made YEARS ago got very old, very fast. Un-subbing"
8308,Pandora,Dustin Burson,3,2,The app keeps opening and running in the background without me opening it. This is after rebooting and make sure all the apps are closed. Why is it doing this?
8309,Pandora,jozette gomez,2,0,I pay for the premium service...I can no longer listen to my playlists off line ..they dont finish downloading ever...i even removed other playlists to have room yet nothing...the music in the stations play the same 6 songs over and over ...not as good as it used to be

8323,Pandora,Jacob Nistler,3,1,"love the music. wish there was a way to rate the adds. I don't mind adds in general, but many adds on Pandora are irrelevant to me and some are very offensive."
8324,Pandora,A Google user,4,2,"Great app for music. Discovered lots of new songs and a couple new favorites through it. The only downside about it is all the adds. I understand they need to play them to get money to play but some of them are so annoying, long, and repetitive. Other then that great app highly recommend it"
8325,Pandora,Cathryn Swann,3,1,"I like it... but I can't find how to turn it off! Have to completely turn off my tablet, or go to setting and use Force Stop. How do I exit the app, have it STOP playing, without having to turn everything off?"

8328,Pandora,Summer Morgan,5,3,just wish had more songs on some stations
8329,Pandora,Bob Dole,1,0,App no longer closes and is always running in the backround until you go into setting and do a force stop. The app doesnt even have a close button and in the notifications bar the x to close the app doesnt work. Uses tons of battery until you force it to close.
8330,Pandora,Oscar Gonzalez,1,23,"not worth the paid subscription, it doesn't actually download the songs if you go out of service range it wont play at all and is incredibly laggy when there is service. over wifi it's acceptable, get spotify instead"
8331,Pandora,George Kypitsn,5,3,I just hope this has internet and is able to play songs while playing another game.. make it not glitch. I thought this was supposed to be an amazing app?

8335,Pandora,Jp FernÃ¡ndez,2,1,App always close after received Call. Totally annoying need to open the app every single time that i received a phone call. RAM Management? or the APP? because i having the same issue on iOS.
8336,Pandora,Charles R,5,9,"I love making my own country music stations with real singers from 2000 and prior. Today's modern pop, rap, white trash country music is pure garbage."
8337,Pandora,Gina Riley,3,7,Why is it that if I pause a song for more than 15 seconds the whole app craps out and I have to click back on the app icon for it to refresh and start a whole new song? It's very annoying....
8338,Pandora,Sophia Livingston,3,1,"What happened Pandora? Seriously!? You use to be my favorite app, but now every time... EVERY TIME I pause Pandora for more than 2 minutes or use my talk-to-text for a minute or so it will just shut off! If I need to go inside a gas station for a few and want to pause a song because I really want to jam out to it, it shuts off and starts the station over and will not go back to that song. It is extremely disappointing. It has been like this for a few months and I can't stand it anymore! I am writing a poor review in hopes that your team will rectify the issue, and quickly before you loose me and others as a subscriber."

8343,Pandora,Daniel Watts,1,8,The notification tab and quick-play option from the drop down don't go away when you close the app. This is terribly annoying. 1 Star until it's fixed.
8344,Pandora,Blurry Stars,4,2,"I've used Pandora for years now, but recently it's been shutting off for no reason. I don't know if I'm the only one who has encountered this problem, but I'm switching to Spotify tomorrow."
8345,Pandora,A Google user,5,2,I truly just love this app and you can find all kinds of music!! It's not for just one type of music. It covers a very large variety of types of music. Everybody will be able to find what they like!!

8377,Pandora,Boop Hoop,4,0,The option to like or dislike a track dont show up on my task bar. Constantly having to open the app to get to the like or dislike button is a bit annoying. Too many ads to me but other than that it seems like an okay app.
8378,Pandora,erin ogden,1,0,I loved it til they started sensoring my songs. Almost 9 years of building my stations the way I want just to have them nuked by sensoring. I'm an adult. If I turn on to hear explicit content i better hear some explicit content. I think I'll try Spotify or iHeartRadio now.
8379,Pandora,LAN man Isaac,4,0,"Works good but the Only thing I hate is when your mid song, pause &minimize the app and later reopen the app, the app restarts! Then you have to go back and restart the song you like because you had to pause. Other then that, Pandora is great ðŸ‘ðŸ¾"

8558,Pandora,Brandon Alcorn,5,0,"I love music and Pandora gives it all to me. No ads if you pay subscription. And perfect for any mood. Love the way it caters to my likes, and saves me from my dislikes. Thanks Pandora you rock."
8559,Pandora,Carlton Young,5,1,i love wish it had way of updating commercial hits IMDb hip hop pop rock turn it over just a way to just solely play commercial hit you know like a real radio station like you know the stuff that's out there that's playing on the airwaves there's times where I've heard music that I've never heard even played on local radio stations here where I live but yet I'm watching award shows where artists who've had album of the year and I never even heard not one song off the album nor from the artist
8560,Pandora,Carol Buttler,3,2,"Originally, I liked Pandora, but lately, it keeps crashing on my new TV. It worked all day today and just a few minutes ago, it crashed AGAIN, with an error message.  This is getting old."
8561,Pandora,FNAFfan Gachagirl453,5,0,"i love Pandora so much! it never existed in this country which made me sad cuz in America, Pandora exists! now I'm happy!!! thanks who ever made this app!"
8562,Pandora,A Google user,4,1,"MY PANDORA ISNT LETTING ME LISTEN TO MUSIC AND ITS SAYING I HAVE NO CONNECTION, WHEN I CLEARLY HAVE WIFI! THIS IS HAPPENING TO TWO PEOPLE. COINCICDENCE? I THINK NOT! I NEED MUSIC! FIX THE ISSUE!"
8563,Pandora,A Google user,5,1,"This app is awesome! You can easily pick your music and mix and match stations. Not only that, but it is avalible on xbox so it is really fun to listen to jams when playing games. If you are looking for a good music app, this is a great one! 10/10 - xbox normie"
8564,Pandora,April Johnson,5,3,keeps me in it! we b jamming!
8565,Pandora,A Google user,4,0,I've had Pandora premium for a couple of years but it's been running horribly the last few months. And today it has decided to censor explicit lyrics... I'm not sure what's going on but I'm going to try another app.
8566,Pandora,Rosemary Groth,5,1,this app is a great app to listen to music you guys should download it
8567,Pandora,A Google user,5,1,so amazing !!! i love Pandora
8568,Pandora,Michael Bullard,5,0,Is an awesome app I recommend it to anybody
8569,Pandora,A Google user,4,1,they did good with this one
8570,Pandora,Michael Cave,5,0,I love the Trance selection there is it amazing....
8571,Pandora,Brad Lothringer,3,1,"It's ok, free version doesn't have a lot of artists songs, I'm assuming because of copyright. Maybe paid is better but not paying to see"
8572,Pandora,Jake Hyle,5,0,"Best music service to discover new music! It tailors a station based on artist, album, or song (if you want stuff very much like that song). Pandora rarely plays something you won't like."
8573,Pandora,allie jolly,2,1,"good music but settings keeps popping up that its running in the background, super annoying. have to keep pushing force stop. ive had this issue until recently."
8574,Pandora,Roland4Deep,2,1,When is Pandora going to give me the option to ban an artist. Slacker radio gives me that when I don't like an artist on a station that I am listening to. It's 2019 Pandora
8575,Pandora,Gerardo Royval,1,1,"Been subscribed for months to Pandora Premium and worked absolutely perfect! I can't even open the app now. You're welcome for the $10 Pandora, subscribing to Spotify now âœŒ"
8576,Pandora,Derick Darwin,3,0,"All of a sudden the app decides to turn itself on. No warning, and never plays anything, but turns on. When it does the only way to turn it off is to force it to stop. Removing from my phone."
8577,Pandora,Marlen Valdez,5,1,I love Pandora. It's the best radio app ever. But it would be awesome if it had the song's music video playing also while the song plays.
8578,Pandora,Gloria Garcia,1,1,Pandora is always having issues not working
8579,Pandora,A Google user,4,1,"Good for a free app. Found lots of new music from it. The ads are hella annoying, but it's free so..... Yeah. To be expected."
8580,Pandora,Victor Valdez,2,4,So many ads! I usely get booted after a couple of songs! I restart app and instantly ads! I love the music it has to offer but hate the ads! Don't have a credit card or debit card to pay for the ads to go away!
8581,Pandora,Desiree Tucker,1,7,Iâ€™ve been paying pandora plus for months the lastb2 months itâ€™s  loaded with ads. Thatâ€™s not what I paid for and I want it canceled ASAP I CANT SEEM TO CANCEL THIS GARBAGE CAN SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME HOW......
8582,Pandora,Matt R,1,0,Ads have become unbearable. Now they're every few songs and there's 2 30 second ones back to back. Twice as loud as the music. Uninstalling.
8583,Pandora,Funmi Abiola,3,0,"3 stars cos I love this app, however, signed up for 1 months free trial but app doesn't recognize this. Still plays ads, what's the point of subscription then?"
8584,Pandora,Starlord234523_tv,3,1,love pandora premium is very very good but do something to make THE BEATELS music available to put into play lists!! the top band of all time and you cant put there music in playlists??
8585,Pandora,Jessica Montes,3,0,why is each song getting cut off like 1 minute in?
8586,Pandora,Dannyboyblue,5,0,it was fun i got to listen to the music thats my type of music

8590,Pandora,lessynn Villatoro,5,0,because it has the best songs :3
8591,Pandora,Mi Si,2,0,Was great for a while but lately its constantly buffering. I'm not a paying customer so I guess you get what you pay for. Ads work great though.

8595,Pandora,M'Lei Dukes,5,0,Can always change the song
8596,Pandora,Jen Jennypants,1,0,I used to love this app. I even pay a month subscription for no limit skipping and no adds. They trick you by adding messages from artists...what's the point of paying if you're gonna interrupted anyway?
8597,Pandora,Karen Silverman,4,0,New To The Station......I Find Pandora Easy To Use & Efficient--- Thanks !!
8598,Pandora,Saul Gutierrez,2,0,"It keeps saying that it is not available on my location, but I live in the US in tx where there should be available. I turned my location it worked and it stop working later in about an hour."
8599,Pandora,AlphaMaleVids,4,4,"For some reason when I open another app with pandora open, pandora closes completely making me reopen and lose the song I'm listening to. Not the biggest issue, just annoying"
8600,Pandora,A Google user,2,4,"Not sure who approved the latest algorithm but Metallica and Guns & Roses doesn't go with Jim Croce, James Taylor, and Simon & Garfunkel. This combined with limited skips is why I've removed the app."
8601,Pandora,Wyatt Richert,1,0,It used to be good until it started playing an add every other song. Like I get it you need money but Jesus calm down with the ads for real. I have to uninstall it because I get so annoyed.
8602,Pandora,Jorge Marin,3,0,"The app activated without my expressed authorization on three occasions. You have no idea were I am when your product activates. I was in a medical facility when it last activated, ergo I deleted the app off my phone."
8603,Pandora,Elijah Reynolds,1,1,I used to love Pandora but now I can't hardly stand it . the music is stale. And the ads have gotten crazy I literally skipped a song earlier and it played three ads in a row #uninstalled
8604,Pandora,A Google user,1,1,"Horrible. Keeps opening without permission when I get into my vehicle. Have to force close to get notification panel off. Paid subscription, not after next month"
8605,Pandora,Bobbie Dalrymple,5,0,music I like at my finger tips on my phone
8606,Pandora,A Google user,5,0,I like it because you can play my favorite music.
8607,Pandora,Lady Cherry,1,0,please fix the bug that isn't allowing music to play & keeps kicking me out of the app. I've uninstalled & reinstalled like 5 times but coming to the conclusion that it is something internal Pandora must fix
8608,Pandora,Phil D,3,0,Not like it used to be. I use it more like a back up.
8609,Pandora,Joseph Bell,5,0,Thank you very much for being free and being good
8610,Pandora,Chris Pena,4,5,"I like the app but for some reason it will stay open on my home screen even when i try to close it, or it will start up on its own when i enter a vehicle and give me the notification though no music is playing"
8611,Pandora,A Google user,3,11,Update (again): Still having persistancy issues with icon in status bar. Need to close app by forceful means to get rid of status bar button. Please fix.
8612,Pandora,Matthew McGarr,3,2,"This would have been a 5 star review except for the fact that, now that I have switched from my Note 5 to my Note 8, the app shuts down every time I pause a song, causing me to have to start a new song every time I pause. This is too bad as I was really happy with Pandora before this, but now I will likely considering switching to Spotify or YouTube Music."
8613,Pandora,A Google user,1,2,personal information just to listen to music okay you're lucky I can't give you 0 stars uninstalling. I remember when you just download the app and listen to music.
8614,Pandora,Jim Cornwell,1,5,They cant keep to one type of music. listening to outlaw country or classic country and I'm hearing Florida Georgia line. AND THY MAKE IT SO FRICKEN DIFFICULT TO DELETE YOUR DAMN ACCOUNT. ITS LIKE A 12 STEP PROGRAM ON HOW TO DELETE ACCOUNT
8615,Pandora,Bonnie Garcia,5,2,"I love all the music choices. Ads are ok, just a part of life and free apps. I have found new artists from listening to Pandora."
8616,Pandora,Revin KevinO,1,0,It is so dumb they don't allow you to create your stations. Now you choose from their genres. Also it glitches your phone when you aren't using it.
8617,Pandora,Autumn Welsh,5,0,"Pandora is a successful and wonderful music app I've been using for three years and many to come. I listen to it on the go, while working out, working and more. Keep up the good work, Pandora!"
8618,Pandora,Pam Burwell,3,1,to confusing if no one to guide you
8619,Pandora,Isaiah Winters,5,2,"I love it, but it stopped working out of no where. It keeps saying that its searching for a connection, but i am connected to my wifi"

8625,Pandora,Teresa Leslie,4,0,Great music app! has radio and podcast.
8626,Pandora,Peyton Brown,3,1,I love pandora and use it every day but it crashes or closes it self everytime you pause it and switch to a different like you call you someone or stop and go inside s store and the come back out to start using it again and it crashes.
8627,Pandora,Molly Voska,5,0,"Great playlists, like having my own personal DJ. Ads are minimally disruptive on free version, and are relevant to me. They just started streaming podcasts! I can't wait to try."
8628,Pandora,M.D. Koffin,1,0,Can't disable autolaunch. The autolaunch option is not checked and I tried toggling it on and off again. Pandora keeps launching itself in the notification bar and eating battery. I will uninstall if this is not fixed.
8629,Pandora,Jeremy R,4,0,"I know I have to listen to ads, but can you at least play some decent ones? I don't want to hear about Trojan condoms and other filth on my radio!! Seems to be happening more and more frequently. Other than that, I'm happy with the app."
8630,Pandora,Avery Hoy,5,9,"Hate the ads, but that's on me for not wanting to pay for premium. However, I had a small issue with the app, emailed Pandora and they got back to me within a couple hours and resolved the issue. In summation, ads suck, but the service is great."
8631,Pandora,Priscilla Vasquez,5,1,"I use it all the time; when I'm studying, when I'm driving, when I'm cleaning. It has all the music you could think of & adds artist to your playlist that fit into your favorite genre of music."
8632,Pandora,A Google user,5,2,its what i've been missing
8633,Pandora,Stephanie Neeley,5,2,this app is completely amazing when I'm in the car listening to the music I do not want to keep looking at my phone this provides me with the utmost latest and oldest oldies but goodies radio I love it
8634,Pandora,rooster Sons of Atonement m.c,5,0,the subscription has more features and no ads
8635,Pandora,Rob Scroggins,1,0,"The app keeps turning itself on. uses battery. Tried uninstalling and re-installing, restarting phone, but have to go into apps and force stop it. It still comes back,on in a few hours."
8636,Pandora,Lauren Jones,4,0,"excelent sound, brings back lots of happy memories!!"
8637,Pandora,Morgan Simpson,5,0,I love this app but there is alot of ad's
8638,Pandora,Amada Amador,5,7,I've been listening to Pandora probably since it first came out. And the stations occasionally do have its misses but almost always has just what i want to hear.
8639,Pandora,David Productions,4,1,"would like to be able to like a song without needing to enter the full app, such as from the lock screen or the drop down menu."
8640,Pandora,Kawaigacha Life,1,1,Great music but I added music to my collection and then turned my Wi-Fi off and the music didn't play and that's why I rated you 1 star please fix and I will change my rating to 5 stars. -Kelsie
8641,Pandora,A Google user,2,0,"I mean it was great, then the ads wouldn't play so i couldn't listen. Another thing is that it cant even make playlist and stuff. It cabt fond any songs i like. But go ahead and give it try"
8642,Pandora,Allen Howell,2,1,"It use to be a great app,now it sucks. After a ad it stops playing. You're lucky to get 3 songs before it stops playing music."
8643,Pandora,A Google user,1,2,"0 stars, trying to unsubscribe is a vicious loop of instructions with no way to stop automatic payments from your credit card! You can't post review until you pick at least 1 star ðŸ˜£"
8644,Pandora,R Smith,2,2,"Was a five star app. Not any more, with the increasing ads, two or more ads between each song, this has become adware with some music. I understand the need for ads to keep Pandora running. I did not mind when ads were added. An ad (one) after listening to several songs, that was fine. I still rated Pandora at five stars. BUT now, two or three ads between each song. Pandora is now playing more ads than music. Pandora is NO long a music app, it is now an ad app, with some music."
8645,Pandora,Sharyn Alden,3,0,just installed....waiting to use??
8646,Pandora,Wilfredo Villegas,1,0,its the worst it keeps crashing and it is getting anoying

8650,Pandora,Candace Middleton,5,0,awesome app and works great!!!
8651,Pandora,A Google user,4,2,"I love the app, I would love it even more if Pandora's stations played the selected singer/genre. For example: Imagine Dragons Station, I would love it if the station only played Imagine Dragons' songs. Only their's and no one else's. Sometimes One Republic, Fall Out Boy, Zayde Wolf, or Twenty One Pilots butts in. Don't get me wrong, I love their music too but most times I'm in the mood for Imagine Dragons' songs. Another thing is offline music, that would be so awesome! I love enjoy this app."
8652,Pandora,Robert McAfee,1,1,Newest update and app is constantly running every time my phone connects to Bluetooth... Uninstalling... It is not acceptable for you to start your app without permission.
8653,Pandora,Jordan M,1,0,recent updates cause Pandora to open randomly in notifications area for no reason... if you click on the notification to go to the app it opens as if you're opening it after a phone restart. in order to close it fully you manually have to go into apps and force close it every time.
8654,Pandora,amelia smith,4,0,"i love it, but I wish they would not play all the song on a certain station on repeat like the station has it's on playlist!! need new artist and songs"
8655,Pandora,Bts_ Gamer16,1,2,Quick question...Am I able to listen to music on this Offline? (I am only putting one star cause I dont know if it works offline)
8656,Pandora,Michael Madlock,1,0,"I have a subscription and it plays whatever it wants to play. Doesn't play whole albums, switches up songs and still plays too many commercials."

8661,Pandora,Embrosia Rines,2,0,Ive been using Pandora forever and really love using it. Im cool with listening to the free version ads but even FM radio doesnt play ads mid-song. Get good Pandora.
8662,Pandora,Basically a Human,1,0,"Everytime I opened it, it would take about 15 minutes to load and then I never have time to listen to music. Plays music fine when it actually works. Deleted it once to see if that would work, it didnt."
8663,Pandora,zachary floyd,5,2,Pandora itself is an excellent service. Thought I could kill two birds with one stone. Support Pandora and get no interruptions.
8664,Pandora,Wendy Aguilar,3,0,"I hate the update! Maybe it's just me, but I couldn't find the shuffle option. I had to google it. Would rather have it more pronounced like it was before."
8665,Pandora,Samieka Sparkman,5,3,"Great app, only problem is it needs more songs when I program a station. When I thumbs down a song that means I don't want to hear it again but other than that Great app"
8666,Pandora,Jesse Brokish,1,0,Why is this app constantly crashing on my Samsung Galaxy S9
8667,Pandora,bigsouley93,1,0,it's all the sudden crashing and I can only play specific songs...PLEASE FIX THIS
8668,Pandora,A Google user,2,0,"I've been paying 11 dollars a month, and it wont even let me download music anymore! even if I'm connected to Wifi! pleaseee fix!!"

8680,Pandora,A Google user,2,1,"so so , this app is constantly buffering. this is the biggest reason that I cancel my plus subscription."
8681,Pandora,Mitchell Smith,1,1,"Newest version automatically starts when connected to bluetooth. There is no way to disable autostart, or shut down the app after it autostarts. Uninstalling."
8682,Pandora,Jezabel Jasso,5,3,This is the best app for listening to music. It allows for background play for free. It gives you a station and recommends new things instead of replaying a song or making you choose all your songs. Also has podcasts and stand up comedy.ðŸŽ¶ðŸ‘ðŸ½
8683,Pandora,Paula B,2,3,"I finally decided to do the free 30 day trial and it's the worst!!! It never works, I've listened to the radio more than ever because it doesn't play. It was better when ads would come on and it was free. If this is what it's like to have a subscription I'd rather listen to ads and have music ðŸŽ¶. I hate this free trial!!! Worst thing ever!!!!"
8684,Pandora,Lee Philbeck,5,1,Please fix the bug for liking songs. It always pops up that there's a error. Please fix asap. Thank you. Very annoyed by it

8694,Pandora,A Google user,5,0,"Absolutely wonderful! It's a great way to take your music everywhere u go, and turn baby boomers on to the ""Blues""."
8695,Pandora,Dawn Hayden,2,4,I have to re-start every time I leave the vehicle or have a phone call. I don't get music suggestions only the same songs over and over. i prefer another music so i used previously.
8696,Pandora,Kiel Nelson,1,0,"Do not get premium! At first it is nice, but then it starts deciding what songs it does and doesnt want to play. I have never been so frustrated in my life until pandora decided 60% of my music didn't need to be accessible. The best part is they have no customer service to call, making trying to contact them about the false advertising of unlimited music impossible. So please do not waste your money on this terrible product."
8697,Pandora,Jennifer Waterland,1,0,"This was my go to app for my music. Now it won't even connect. Uninstalled and reinstalled twice, rebooted phone and data it still won't connect. Not sure what to do now."
8698,Pandora,Grant C,1,2,"Stupid app computer pics your songs that don't match stations (hence your listening mood) and they mislabeled some songs & artists. I'm not paying for less commercials, ONLY COMMERCIAL FREE"
8699,Pandora,Jaywillie 75,1,0,The mobile version keeps closing randomly without hesitation
8700,Pandora,Kayla Rose,5,1,Love it!! It really gets to know you and plays great music that you didn't know/forgot you liked. Best music app out there.

8706,Pandora,Fuller Bates,4,9,Great music app just on my phone since the last few updates it constantly says Pandora is using battery. It's like the only way to shut down the app is to force stop it. Moto z2
8707,Pandora,Tessa Watts,4,0,I lobe Pandora Premium when it works.. but for months now it hasn't allowed me to download any music which was the point of me getting it in the first place. please fix this.
8708,Pandora,Elise L.,1,0,"I think it's weird that I add songs to my collection, but I literally have to search to find the song each time. Where am I saving my songs, and why can't I see them? This app is stupid."
8709,Pandora,A Google user,2,1,"New problems. Unusable. Plays about 2 songs on phone and then pauses. Says ""buffering"". Have had this app for years w/no problems."
8710,Pandora,kAt yO,1,0,This app has worked awesome for the last few years until today so I'm going to give it the benefit of the doubt and maybe it crashed and they're tuning up the issues but guys get it together some of us pay for this app and cannot live without our music get this fixed ASAP guys or Spotify it is
8711,Pandora,Warner Anderson,2,1,"Now I find this app running in the background at all times. No option in app settings to change this. What is Pandora gaining from this covert activity? This behavior is unacceptable and although I enjoy Pandora, I do not want it hiding behind corners and lurking in the shadows of my phone. I am switching to Spotify - for now!"
8712,Pandora,Ira McManus,3,0,They push u too much to buy their monthly subscription. Also they won't let u play same channel all the time. And they always have ads for sex toys etc..which is inappropriate with my kids in car
8713,Pandora,A Google user,3,0,I was giving this 5 stars until they added podcast. Everytime I try and run that feature the app crashes. Last time I had to uninstall/reinstall the app for it to work again.

8788,Pandora,Megan Henry,2,1,Music chosen is no where near the style originally chosen. Who is listening and making style decisions on this app? Are they even musicians?
8789,Pandora,A Google user,5,2,"So worth it to pay for it just saying , no commercials and the best part is when you don't have service you have your own playlist of everything that you liked"
8790,Pandora,Ezekiel Nicholson,4,3,i hate the fact that the music sometimes stops after around 4 songs but I find this app very useful for music other than anything.

8801,Pandora,Terry Carter-Reed,5,0,This app takes me back to when music was music. Not like the stuff nowadays where just about every artist has a computer sing for them. Thank you Pandora!!!!
8802,Pandora,Keyana Rogers,3,1,a programmed station plays the same songs in the same order every time I turn it on. not enough variety of the artist playing on programmed station.
8803,Pandora,Briley Wood,4,0,I did not get the last question: can you uses this app for playing music? Well ya that is what the app is used for right. But other than that the app is good.

8817,Pandora,Ps J,4,19,"Great music streaming service, but the answer will drive you crazy. The app keeps throwing the ads at you all the time. The pay version is quite good but rather expensive."

8834,Pandora,A Google user,1,4,ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤I just updated my pandora app because it always kept crashing. The update claimed it would fix it. Evidently it did not. Dont recommed if you dont have unlimited data because youre basically just wasting you're data on no fix.
8835,Pandora,Ethan Peng,1,1,"i have Pandora plus, and every time i make a station for a specific reason (in this case final fantasy music) it plays music not relevant to the station and every time i try to skip it gives me the mundaine reason that ""for to licensing agreements we cannot honor the promises given to you for Pandora plus unlimited skips"". this service is a complete waste of time/money. if a company we to lie to you this much I'd at least prefer that they tell me to my face, but Pandora will falsely promise anyt"
8836,Pandora,Josh Cornelius,1,2,I paid my subscription for this month and my offline is going crazy it's skipping on its own from song to song and will not stop and play the music I've even uninstalled and reinstalled still doing it
8837,Pandora,Julie Spilman,4,1,"This is an outrage, the new update broke this app. It just saying waiting for connection. Then retry but when I hit retry it just loads and then takes me back to the waiting for connection screen. What the heck. Like I paid money for Pandora Plus and now it's broken? I'm beyond mad now. Edit: The app works again. ðŸ˜„"
8838,Pandora,A Google user,2,0,I've had my Pandora since 2013.. Its an old interface. Needs updated. I dont mind the ads but i think alot of people would want that especially since how much data you consume!
8839,Pandora,Di-Anna Broadwater,4,2,its usually pretty good but lately it's been going silent for short periods of time other than this it's really great.
8840,Pandora,Brittni Hayes,1,0,i hate this stupid fu kiin app i always have to uninstall the reintall because the stupid app wont pick up anything

8844,Pandora,A Google user,4,0,You get to listen to your favorite songs. And you don't have to pay for it. This app is very good if you love music. High quality Bpm. Hd sound. The only down side is there is some ads.
8845,Pandora,Killa Spy CDR,1,1,pay for a premium service for my downloads to be deleted by the program daily then only upload 10 songs then stop or even start deleting those 10. about to cancel my subscription soon.
8846,Pandora,Juan Soto,5,3,"Although not every song I have searched for I've found, Its by far one of my top music apps (and with premium its the best! nothing else even compares!)."

8848,Pandora,Carrie Boyed,5,1,I love pandora. I've been using it for years. The app is easy to navigate and even the free version allows much listening with limited ads. Would recommend to anyone.
8849,Pandora,A Google user,5,0,Exquisite in everything I have looked for and I will get one of those outstanding wonderful customer service representative anything and everything will be taken care of for anyone.

8852,Pandora,Warren Kile,5,2,Pandora is the TRUTH in the online music realm! How can you NOT love it; You can make your own radio stations!
8853,Pandora,Kashondra Williams,2,0,"Pandora does not let you cast to the Google ChromeCast. That is how I listen to music when at home, so it was not much use to me."
8854,Pandora,Jordan Varney,1,4,"Premium is really not that great. Limited selections, the songs stop multiple times while playing, slightly confusing layout. I use this app for music while I drive and when songs just stop out of nowhere that causes hazards to me so I'd rather find an app the continuously works. Maybe if the bugs in premium were fixed itd be ok but not worth it and very frustrating."
8855,Pandora,Gavin Risley,2,1,Premium is pointless downloads rarely ever work and it says its going to download songs and never does basically theyre selling an added function for 10 dollars a month that DOESNT DO ANYTHING
8856,Pandora,Logan Doyle,1,2,Bruh why can't I kick other users off my account why do I pay a monthly prescription to constantly click let me listen!!!! RIDICULOUS!!!!

There is an amazing variety, I honestly didn't expect to find the fandom songs that I was hoping to find and was fortunately proven wrong. I do wish it didn't have a limited number of skips per hour. Otherwise, amazing!"
8912,Pandora,Brittany Dushkin,1,0,the app wont let me delete my account so i keep getting charged $10 for an app i never use. please dont pay them. their phone number has no human help it directs you to the websight.

8930,Pandora,Rose Dunham,1,2,I wanted a music app where i could listen to songs ad free while still using other apps on my phone. I had YouTube Red but noticed that Pandora Plus was cheaper and did the same thing so i switched. At first if i was using another app that had ads Pandora would just pause and i could continue playing music once the ad was over. Now it shuts off instead of pausing so im unable to use it while using my other apps. I'm very disappointed. Safe to say I will be switching back to YouTube Red.

9068,Pandora,Chris Appellof,5,0,Ads only on the free version. Once you pay for Pandora plus or Pandora premium ads are removed. Plus with pandora premium (which is the $10 subscription) it works just like spotify.

9092,Pandora,Alberto Marquez,2,0,I'm thinking about deleting this app. It plays more ads than music. 1 song for every 2 ads is not cool at all.
9093,Pandora,Javier De La O Lainez,3,2,"Applied Jan. 14th update and since the app freezes when thumbing down or skipping, have to force shut down and restart to resume playing."

9107,Pandora,Craven Shadowvayne,1,1,"you guys have been having technical difficulties for months, when will it be fixed?! I can't even make bew stations or add to existing ones."
9108,Pandora,Ryan Fink,1,3,Just because I like one song does not mean I want to listen to a completely different style of music than what I had been listening to previously. I wouldn't pay a penny for the premium.

9498,Pandora,El Cata,1,0,lets gets something straight the apps is awesome for music but sending malicious ads thru the apps is not cool my virus and malware detection was going off the charts blocking every ad that played while the music is playing with the lockscreen open or closed which is crazy because that means somebody at Pandora aint doing they job by screening this ads before they stream on people phones which is potentially a recipe for disaster to hit...... when the one perons gets hacked in due time

10719,Pandora,Romel Campoverde,1,5,It had issues and never got better and after I cancelled premium subscription they still charging me
10720,Pandora,Heidi Berg,5,0,love it but buffers too much
10721,AmazonMusic,Richard Boer,5,17,"First time using the app was on a road trip. Not sure why I hadn't used it sooner. I just set the station like a radio station, and connect it to the cars Bluetooth. Using the buttons on the steering wheel to replay songs I like and skipping forward past the ones I didn't. No breaks in play, even through Kansas, so assume there's some buffering for when you don't have internet."
10722,AmazonMusic,Annie Brown,5,49,"love this app..... i had to delete it two days ago to fix a problem and once i downloaded it back my music was still there and my name was at the top, welcoming me back..... so so so loving this...... amazon you rock Thank you so very much..... from a music lover"
10723,AmazonMusic,Larry Warren,3,20,"one concurrent use not fair...especially since prime increase this year...one is just cheap. Should be 2 concurrent with prime, 4 with unlimited. Update 4/19...lot of pauses, stops etc when chromecast audio casting...maybe even if playing on phone (android)... other cast apps play fine so this app, not google...please fix!"
10724,AmazonMusic,Danny Martinez,3,4,it's a great app with tons of music but it gets confusing on what you're doing sometimes and also I decided to stop paying for the music unlimited and it stopped letting me listen too all my music and It deleted all my downloaded music and offline playlists I think it was dumb and I should of been able to keep all my music I already downloaded
10725,AmazonMusic,Michael C.,3,11,"Its tough to build the playlist I want. The interface is unintuitive and builing the playlist I want is a chore. I cant save my playlist across phones unless it only contains music bought from Amazon, meaning that if I have a playlist with music saved on my sd card, that playlist is erased when I switch my phone even though I still have the card. And stop pushing prime music on me. I already have prime!"
10726,AmazonMusic,Adriana Beal,2,19,"I find the interface confusing at times, and hard to create playlists with the offline/online options. Also, I feel like the app keeps trying to make me listen to music I don't like."
10727,AmazonMusic,Charles Ryan,5,6,"Great music selection, even from artists that aren't mainstream. Love listening to music on our Echo Dots."
10728,AmazonMusic,V. M. James,4,27,I enjoy the variety the service offers and not having commercials. I do have difficulty with the portability of playlists from one device to another.
10729,AmazonMusic,P K Gambhir,4,1,Like this app. Original soundtracks. Quality of music appreciable. Very vast collection. High quality recording.
10730,AmazonMusic,A Google user,1,208,"Paying for a service that works some times. Half the time the service doesn't work. When it does, you look at one album, then it won't open any more. Just get the spinning wheel of confusion like it was asked it to do to much. Sometimes it's days before it works again and then one album only, again. Won't play songs that have been down loaded that used to play in ""Offline"". Says some songs are on an SD card that I've never had."
10731,AmazonMusic,Si Or Sid,2,63,"Used to be fine but now constantly jumps and skips. It's like a scratched CD, every song skips a bit and it's annoying as anything. I've got no other apps open, I've tried switching the phone on and off but it still does it. What the hell is wrong with it???? Update, now alexa keeps interrupting songs. Get a few seconds or a minute into the song and alexa comes in telling me to ""try saying....."", well I don't want to, all I want to do is to listen to the song. Stop interrupting."
10732,AmazonMusic,Megan Herring,5,158,"absolutely my favorite music option hands down anytime. I'm not looking for anything ""like"" what I want to listen to, I'm looking for EXACTLY what I want to be listening to. With internet access or without, thanks to download options.....amazon music app gives me what I want when I want it. I have recommended it to every music lover I know and the feedback is consistently great!! thank you!!"
10733,AmazonMusic,Sherida Glover,5,66,"I can buy songs I want without the whole cd but better, I can listen to music I don't want or need to own. This lets me discover new artists, especially through the playlists but it also lets me put together playlists of my own for visits with my granddaughter (who really needs to own Baby Shark?) and pull up songs when someone says ""Do you remember that song...?"" With the app, I can listen to music while I use other apps even if I'm not broadcasting to speakers.. Youtube doesn't work that way."
10734,AmazonMusic,Joseph Supple,1,14,broken. does not work after os upda Used to be a good music app. No More. Amazon Music Used to be a good music app. But - No More. It tries to upsell you to get Amazon Music Prime with an add that stops you before going into the app. No matter how many times you have selected Offline Music it puts you into Online Music for searches. It appears you can't consistently play music that is on your device without a network connection. It just took me 20? 25? minutes to play two songs in my library.
10735,AmazonMusic,Anil Kakde,2,36,"It has all the songs. But, (1) I'm an audiophile. The music quality is not comparable to lossless formats (FLAC). All songs seem to have a prebuilt EQ that prevents me from getting quality on pro equipment (2) The widget works only when the app is running. It should work no matter what. (3) The navigation on the app is not fully intuitive. Once you play a song, it is really difficult to navigate back to your playlists. Hopefully it will all get better."
10736,AmazonMusic,Tejas Vatsa,3,2,"When I play the first music in the app, I can move to next song but cant go back to previous song in the queue. If I am playing a music from the top of the queue then pressing the previous music button must take me to the last song in the queue but it does not. It is very irritating and you have introduced it in any of the updates. Please fix it."
10737,AmazonMusic,Todd Griffith,1,8,This app was great when i first started using it 4 or 5 years ago. It's slowly gotten worse and worse. I regret the amount of money I've spent buying albums I can't listen to because of this unstable app. Do not make the same mistake I did. App constantly crashes and gives a #183 error. I redownload and reinstall and we start the cycle all over again.
10738,AmazonMusic,A Google user,2,31,"App has some annoying ticks. They should get rid of ""online"" and ""offline"" playlists and just have one kind of playlist. Right now you cant play any songs in your offline playlist if you've chosen to listen to music online. Surely you should be able to access ALL your music/playlists while you're online, because you're... online! The songs you haven't downloaded will obviously not play if you're offline and not streaming, so it's ridiculous to set up to different kinds of playlists. 2 stars :-("
10739,AmazonMusic,Jake Abbott,3,102,"it's not without issues. Works okay if you have good service. Even offline, downloaded music will only play one song at a time if you have little or no service. Then you have to go back and select a new song. Also many of my favorite songs or albums I have downloaded suddenly. Are no longer available on Amazon music. When I first signed up for prime it was awesome. in the last few years, like most service from Amazon, in my opinion it has taken a sharp turn downhill."
10740,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,9,I love Amazon music!!! One big suggestion would be to allow us to check a box for music videos that exist for any of our songs. When I'm hiking or especially on the treadmill seeing the videos along with the music would be awesome and I don't think any of the other music sources do it. Another reason for people to love Amazon music even more!!!
10741,AmazonMusic,Aaron Watson,3,7,Great app - great selection - clunky UI. Sometimes I get stuck in a song and there is no way to easily get back to the artist or album. Needs better or expanded navigation options when playing.
10742,AmazonMusic,Kelcey Altsman Dituro,3,23,"I have two big issues for my own personal usgae of this app. They won't allow you to have over 500 songs in a playlist. I'm big on having genre-based playlists, so this can be very limiting. Also, the variety on the stations is awful and very repititive. I don't want to hear the same songs on the same station 5 minutes later. Or on the next station if I switch. I already have my music through Amazon, which is why I'm using this app, but Spotify works much better overall in my opinion."
10743,AmazonMusic,Trevor Underwood,5,212,"An easy to use app with a variety of music. though sometimes the more obscure songs may be removed from the list (most likely because the provider changed) you more often than not find and add them to your list again. Through easy set up playlists to just genre based stations, this app has been a go to after trying several others, and i am sure you will feel the same wheb it comes to selection and ease of use"
10744,AmazonMusic,Skyler Biggane,2,406,"My issue with Amazon Music is that you don't have access to all the songs. Even as a Prime member you must purchase the Music Unlimited package to gain access to all the songs. The really good music that you might like possibly will not be available. The price for it is relatively cheap, however this is just another way for the Amazon company to make more money from you. In the end just compare the price to Spotify or Pandora and you basically have figured out the best music app for yourself"
10745,AmazonMusic,Z M.,2,19,"Lately app keeps crashing. Also, I have been listening to the music stations and keep getting songs that won't play even though they've played hundreds of times before. Would be nice to add variety to the artist stations as well like Pandora BC the same songs are played multiple times, sometimes within the same hour. And every time I select one station in particular, the same song kicks it off, no matter what time of day"
10746,AmazonMusic,A Google user,1,4,Could do better! Why do I need to be online for the app to start working so that I can play music I have PURCHASED and saved to my phone? Why when I am searching for an artist or a song does the app default to Amazon Music to try and sell me something more when I have already purchased the song and saved it to my phone? I buy my music so the app should work like a music player not just a sales tool.
10747,AmazonMusic,Jessivee Fan,5,58,I have used Amazon to buy music for more than 15 years. Before the App was available I bought CDs from amazon about 5 years later the App came out so I downloaded it. Approx. One month later i recieved an email saying Amazon music had found music I had previously purchased and loaded it into my library. I was blown away to find the albums i had bought so long ago all right there to enjoy again. So pleased. I love amazon music.
10748,AmazonMusic,A Miller,2,287,Going to cancel my membership. the app over the years has degraded to the point where it seems that they want to push you to purchase or download their music. at this point I'm not even able to search the music that I've already purchased to find a particular song when it's in the offline mode. I'm going to go ahead and go to Spotify or one of the other music agencies and purchase that my music there for now on or even Google.
10749,AmazonMusic,Tameka Burton,1,5,"I am a prime member and I also have the kindle unlimited app, a fire stick, now the music app. This app sucks royally the music played is not a real variety this need to be fixed. If I choose artist station the same songs should not be play more then once, with the amount of songs that's out there. This needs to change or I will go back to Pandora!!!!"
10750,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,85,"I always find the music I'm looking for. Great sound quality. Excellent features without being bloated or trying too hard. This has replaced all other music apps I've used, as it exceeds their form and function. Plus, if you're already a prime member, the service is included. Just give Amazon a hug already."
10751,AmazonMusic,Tom Norton,1,2,"Great for music purchases. But, really not very good on music playback. Frequently, crashes, can't find stored music(purchased from Amazon) on SD card, says my purchased music not downloaded when in fact it is. Bottom line great for purchasing. Otherwise, the app """"sucks"""". 2018.10.15 - Latest update is a real stinker."
10752,AmazonMusic,Jason H,2,7,I used to love this app. Lately I've had tons of issues with it. I'll start a song I've purchased and it'll start for a second or 2 and then no sound at all but the song is still playing. My media setting are set to high and still nothing. If I purchase music I'll use it but I'll just download it to my device and stop using the Amazon player.
10753,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,10,"BEST music app! It has everything. You can easily find any song or album. You can find any type of category or stations. Any type, decade, soundtracks, genres. You can download any song, artist, similar music, or album. You can listen offline or stream online. The sound quality is amazing. I downloaded & tried nearly every music player, equalizer & mp3 bass booster apps in Google Play & APK & none could compare to Amazon music. It's my favorite app. Thanks to developer for perfect music app!!"
10754,AmazonMusic,A Google user,1,32,"Getting worse with each update. OK so the offline mode was bad before. If you had no signal it would take up to two minutes to launch to a usable state. Now it also constantly nags you to allow streaming and downloads over cellular on launch. I think those so called devs have no concept of what offline ACTUALLY means. Edit: Downgraded again. Asked me 7 times to enable Cellular access. Tried to download several albums, just kept saying an error has occurred try again. Thats just the start."
10755,AmazonMusic,A Google user,3,7,"So everything was fine until like 3 weeks later a message started to pop up that I need to change my settings to download over Mobile network. I dont download anything but I still tried to fiddle with the settings to make it go away. Unfortunately, I have not found a way to remove the message and it is becoming extremely annoying. Pretty please fix this I was having a great time before."
10756,AmazonMusic,A Google user,1,474,"Poor quality app. Ive had issues with buffering when the app is running in the background, glitchy and unresponsive widgets, music randomly stopping and being difficult to restart. Its seems neverending. When it does work it certainly has a lot to offer, but I just can justify paying for something that doesnt work."
10757,AmazonMusic,Nick Smith,3,26,Awesome selection of songs... but app has been stopping a lot lately when playing through my car. also the song info in my car is spotty... when playing my library off my phone this always works. seems to be a recent issue just with Amazon. It seems to like to play the same songs over and over even though I have thousands in my music. Works better on my Alexa devices at home than on the road. sure hope they fix this
10758,AmazonMusic,Sriram Vuppalapati,2,20,"I'm a very satisfied amazon customer on all accounts, except for this app. It keeps crashing, every time there is a change made, either it is downloads or activating alexa. I have to reinstall every time it crashes. Offline downloads have to be deleted for it to work. Please patch the errors, I don't want to use any other app, I love the interface."
10759,AmazonMusic,clair leavey,5,4,It is great for finding play lists depending upon what mood you are in and what genre of music you would like to listen to. I can also play albums I used to have on CD as a teenager. I can play it through my bluetooth speakers around the house and it uses less battery on my phone than I would expect. I love this app.
10760,AmazonMusic,Andrew Bryant,1,4,"You've got a long way to go! Signed up to student deal for Music Unlimited. The App is very buggy/unresponsive, pressing songs to play/tap on search won't do a thing sometimes, even after factory reset. The music selection is average (million+ view YouTube songs do not exist on music unlimited) You can't create a playlist from streamed music. Suggested music is either previously played songs or off at a tangent due to poor selection, esp. dance music. Â£7.99 a month?! Back on YouTube music now."
10761,AmazonMusic,John Wolf,1,23,"Could and should be much better. Whenever you open it the app reverts back to some song I listened to a long time ago. Even when cache is cleared. Also, locks up a lot. Update, keeps getting worse. Now in midsle of listening to an album streaming to an Echo it changes over and starts playing another artist. Crazy"
10762,AmazonMusic,Jess,1,12,"Well, it's great when it works. But why does my music keep disappearing? Tell me why hundreds of songs randomly disappear from being downloaded? My account hasn't changed. This isn't the first time. Songs randomly skip or stop entirely in the middle of playing. The frustration is really not worth the subscription."
10763,AmazonMusic,Chris Smith,1,291,"when I first got this app it was excellent included all music but now I have to pay Â£7.99 per month to get what I originally had as being a prime member. I don't use it enough to warrant paying this, and the music I saved or favourited is no longer accessible. what's left is not really to my music taste."
10764,AmazonMusic,Nipun Grover,1,4,"This app has major flaws , so many bugs and it clears up my queue suddenly , sometimes i can't change position of songs in queue , removing songs from playlists is really tough . i think wynk music was a much better option even though it had ads but this app has issues Amazon is not fixing . i am thinking of switching back to wynk as this has major flaws and has greatly disappointed me ."
10765,AmazonMusic,Åukasz CzekaÅ‚a,2,5,Spotify is so much better than this app!!! I'm a Prime member and I've been using both apps for few months and I know what I'm saying. I'll switch to Spotify as soon as I won't need the Prime membership anymore. Waste of time. So many songs are missing and the search function is simply useless.
10766,AmazonMusic,Rick Reynolds,5,1,"been using it for about two years... it keeps improving as it goes... When I first started using it I couldn't find some of the black metal bands I like. Now I can, right now I am listening to Leviathon. I can find Gorgoroth. Bands that are on independent labels are not shut out on Amazon.. thank you for that."
10767,AmazonMusic,Michael Lewis,1,4,"Bluetooth doesn't work. This is the only app that won't work on any of my Bluetooth devices. The audio is extremely low and the quality hurts my ears. Sounds like the speaker is broken, but only happens with this app. I contacted customer support and was told that they couldn't do anything for me. I'll find another music app."
10768,AmazonMusic,john Oneplus,1,1,Would be good if you can use Alexa when screen is turned off and can use voice commands.
10769,AmazonMusic,A Google user,4,183,I've given this app multiple chances including prime subscriptions and it still doesn't seem to pan out to my liking. I'd again rather just purchase my songs thru this app to sync to another music app that complement a simple music genre playlist of my choice. This app is also suppose to automatically download my new purchases when set to do so thru the settings menu and it doesn't. I have to manually download after each purchase everytime...very annoying.
10770,AmazonMusic,Rafael O,4,188,"Great Library, good selection for both regional and international music. Sound quality is one of the best among streaming services. However, the app is a let-down. It's buggy and the design feels a little dated. Also, it doesn't support casting to the Amazon Fire TV Stick. Playlists are not as good or as many as Spotify. If you can overlook all the quirks, Amazon Music is worth it."
10771,AmazonMusic,Ian Deslow,3,36,Moved over to this after the spotify offer ended and it worked out cheaper with the student prime I have. TBH that's where the positives end - price. Spotify are far supreme. One major issue is when I've shuffled the top charts it'll play five songs then stop forcing you to open the app up. Not something you'd want to do getting the phone out. Other than that would expect more from Amazon.
10772,AmazonMusic,nihal antony,2,3,"My biggest problem is with the search results for the songs, especially searching for songs using Alexa. A lot of times the first recommendation is not the original audio, it'll be a remix version or a cover by someone else. A lot of times it'll show of times it'll show less popular songs with a similar title"
10773,AmazonMusic,Andy Heer,3,3,Great selection of music but two annoying features. 1. Plays an annoying jingle every time a song starts despite all notifications being turned off. Have discovered that it's the widget that causes the annoying jingle. The widget is fairly useless anyway so I've deleted it. 2. Can't place a shortcut to an album or playlist.
10774,AmazonMusic,TheYellowBow Woods,1,2,Ive used this app for years and it was an amazing app until they added unlimited- an add on subscription for access to more music. Which was annoying. Thats what Prime used to be for. i thought you could still just buy the music. WRONG. if you buy music that is unlimited it will NOT let you download or listen but it WILL take your money. ive contacted help before and theyve just given me refunds but not taken care of the issue that i still would like to purchase the song and listen to it.
10775,AmazonMusic,TomÃ¡s GarcÃ­a,5,1,"Hi there, I like this app. I usually use it as player for offline Prime Music content and music in my device and it works fine. But I cannot see an option for disable device's music folders (or select them) so all audio files (e.g. WhatsApp audios) are in my library. Any advice or help? Thanks in advance."
10776,AmazonMusic,Kieran Detheridge,2,6,"good streaming service, but the controls are horrible. to play one song from an album, you must first hold an album, click ""view details"" and select the song to play. This adds the entire album to the queue. If you then want to queue a different song from a different album, you have to skip all the other songs in the album. Terrible controls, would not recommend. Get spotify premium instead, same price and just as easy to use with Alexa or other home assistants, but with better controls."
10777,AmazonMusic,Hannah Im,4,99,"Love that this is a free service for Prime members and that I can now listen to music without having to take up storage on my phone. Love there are no commercials. The library is enormous. Totally awesome, and fantastic that I can use Alexa with it too. Only problem is that it won't stream continuously when connected to Alexa. I have to force the next song forward manual manually every time. Also, wish they'd make the lyrics easier to read - blue on black is not a great color scheme."
10778,AmazonMusic,A Google user,3,8,"I love having access to music, what I don't like is when I tune in to a station and the playlist is virtually the same every time I choose it, this induces boredom. Amazon would benefit from using a different music selecting algorithm, which would allow for more variety within each station. Until that happens, 3 out of 5 stars is the very best I can rate it, and the 3 stars reflect my generosity because I believe my satisfaction is more align with 2 1/2 stars, but that was an option.

10779,AmazonMusic,Kaitlin Watkins,2,6,"I'm paying for this subscription and the songs i am adding into my playlist is it keeps removing it and it is really starting to bug me, seems how I'm paying for this app and it's playing up for me is damn right wrong, and I can't find any sort of amazon music email to email this problem to them, so that's why it's on hereðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡"
10780,AmazonMusic,Billy Plemmons,1,5,dont get me wrong I love the option of music that I can listen too. my issue is I pay for prime music yet my playlist and music that I add to cloud comes up missing. once a week I have to start over from nothing. The offline playlist does the same thing. Once this gets fixed I will re-rate.
10781,AmazonMusic,A Google user,3,91,"Only giving three instead of five because what they giveth, they sometimes taketh away. You might download a song today that's free with your prime membership only to find out it won't play later & has moved over to the ""unlimited"" (paid) version. Would be much nicer if they would leave songs in one category..."
10782,AmazonMusic,Craig Reynolds,1,8,"Great app spoiled by upgrade. In the last few weeks they have taken the ability to filter new albums ans songs by genre, which means their opinion of what is a good new album takes precedent over the musical tastes if the user. Poor form amazon. Spoke to customer service, they agree the upgrade is poor. Please put back this basic feature."
10783,AmazonMusic,Shannon Jones,1,3,"the reason I'm giving this app an 1 star rating. is because I don't like the fact; that Amazon is removing free songs that weren't on Amazon unlimited and putting them on placing them on Amazon prime. I'm already paying a monthly fee for Amazon prime, and and Now I have to an extra fee for free music. no"
10784,AmazonMusic,Daniel G,1,3,Love having all the songs but the algorithm for shuffle is awful. It only shuffles by song name beginning letters. it pulls from a small number of songs then I end up hearing the same stuff from my huge library of music. I often hear the same songs over and over again too. Very Frustrating
10785,AmazonMusic,Mateusz Malisz,1,3,"Widget is buggy. The ui is cluttered and unintuitive. The integration with the Os is also bad, the application doesn't even register sound volume up or down until I start playing the music. And now they're asking me to rate them 5 stars. Guess it's time to move to Spotify."
10786,AmazonMusic,A Google user,1,10,"Very poor UI when trying to use in the car on my phone, bordering on dangerous. My other music app on my phone is one touch to open, one touch to select an album and one touch to select a track, it's simple, quick and safe. The Amazon app is a nightmare, multiple clicks and multiple dead ends with so many skins for recent, online, offline, library etc. it is such a long winded and convoluted route to find and play a track. I really try to avoid using it if I can, as I don't want to crash."
10787,AmazonMusic,Dakota DeFore,3,2,"This app is good, but it could use some improvments. 1. Some audio options would be great, as it is now every song has a fade out. This means albums that are meant to not have pauses have this weird silence between tracks. 2. The option to view artist and other info while looking at an album instead of having to go back a page would be amazing and save way more time while sorting. 3. Some better discovery options for music. It's a solid app currently, but it could easily be much better."
10788,AmazonMusic,Jeff Potsworthy,1,24,"I loved this app, when I first got it. However, since the most recent updates it got worse and worse. The Alexa update was cool and novel, good to show off to your friends. But, with that update came a travesty, all the music i downloaded for offline listening just stopped working. It said to refresh my music which i did repeatedly but it didn't work. Both these playlists were well over 200 songs long and i cant remember all of them nor the order. To make matters worse, i constantly lose music."
10789,AmazonMusic,BS Warmer,1,2,"Used to rule, now only drool. Amazon music used to be my go to for storing my music collection and taking it with me on the go (for years). was perfect!! Now they are practically forcing all users to their unlimited plan. Unlimited is not for me, now heading to Google for my music."
10790,AmazonMusic,Tony D,3,2,"Really like this app but been havin a bit of trouble with it. When playing music & my phone locks, the music starts to judder. this is particularly annoyin when listenin in the car through bluetooth. I'm drivin along playin something awesome (of course) when my screen times out & the music starts playin up. has anyone else had this kinda problem? would give 5 stars if not for this. T. West Yorkshire And yeah, like loads of other users, why should we pay for premium when we buy Amazon music??"
10791,AmazonMusic,Angharad,4,74,Millions of songs to choose from. Some songs are only available on unlimited which is amazon's way of trying to get you to pay for that service. All songs I've downloaded are great quality and there are good playlist available that are tailored to your music taste. Only problem I've sometimes had is the 'add to play queue' option. Doesn't always play the songs that I've added to the queue. The app has also crashed a couple of times recently. On the whole a great app.
10792,AmazonMusic,Keshav Menon,2,1557,"While the collection is very good, the User Interface leaves a lot to be desired. Here are my issues with it: 1) When you pick a song from the library to play, there is no option to pick just that song. It adds all songs in the library to the queue. Moreover, when you click clear queue, it removes the selected song too. 2) When you press the cross button at the top, it exits the app instead of going to the song library. 3) There is no equaliser, or it is very difficult to find."
10793,AmazonMusic,Mici Gerkins,3,10,"Good for background noise, but not great for really enjoying older music. Used to be a great, useful app. Now their focus is monthly subscriptions instead of owning your music. Also, some mp3s are are so stripped that they aren't the songs we remember, just pale imitations. Artists come and go as well, so what's on your playlists today might not be there tomorrow."
10794,AmazonMusic,Keegan Gassett,3,47,"Honestly, I appreciate the wide variety of music there has only been two songs that I have searched for that came back not found. I have one request for the developers if its even possible; I would like to see the app open and imediately display downloaded/offline songs. I have noticed that if I am walking out of my house and in my car to go to work, I have to either drive far enough away from my house that my wifi disconnects or turn the wifi off on my phone. other than that, its great"
10795,AmazonMusic,A Google user,4,529,Not a bad app. I can find new music and buy it if I choose. Works with Amazon prime for some of the music on there (more music than you'd think) but also has a lot of excusice music for their dedicated music subscription. Does not create the best playlists for me to find new music though. Overall worth it if you like to actually own your music and not just rent it. 3.5 stars If I could.
10796,AmazonMusic,Steve Moddelmog,1,4,"App has become pretty much unusable. When I try to play something in my library, I get a big empty box with a blue ""progress"" dot - not moving, an x for cancelling out in the upper left corner, and some random dashes. I have four tablets and a phone, and it's the same in all five devices. Occasionally I get a normal screen and can play music, but if I try to cast to my Echo Plus, I always get ""something gone wrong."" I have to use Google Play Music to play the songs I've bought from Amazon."
10797,AmazonMusic,Neel Gajjar,1,4,"It's bad. my playlists get deleted automatically. And then I make new playlist. After a week, the old playlists appear out of nowhere and the new one disappears. I click to play a song. The app shows a song 2-3 places above in queue is being played. I try to change the order of queue. It doesn't happen and the whole queue gets messed up. I had give 4 stars earlier. Fix all these bugs or I will have to stop using amazon prime and move to other apps."
10798,AmazonMusic,Peter Archer,1,647,"I'm sick of this app. Yes it works good with the Echo family and streaming to my phone is fine but download music and play it offline and it's a whole different experience. The music randomly stutters, crackles and frequently takes up to a minute to transition between songs! This is not a new thing as many users online testify to so I don't understand why it is so difficult for the developers to fix. Stop focusing on the new stuff and fix the basics first. Customer service no help at all."
10799,AmazonMusic,Alan Estes,4,32,"I enjoy listening to Amazon music because it's similar to Pandora, but I can choose to listen to my liked songs only, I'm a prime member so I get a basic music plan. My one complaint would be that you get less songs than Pandora and you have to pay more money to unlock more songs. One would think a prime member should have a better song selection. Honestly if you're looking for a music only plan, Amazon music isn't the best way to go. Pandora is cheaper and you get more music for your money."
10800,AmazonMusic,Kelly Cook,3,2,"It's okay-ish. Might switch to Spotify later, idk. The interface could use some work. It can be kinda buggy (I add a song to my playlist, it said it was added but I go to said playlist and it was not added, etc). Rearranging the order of songs on a playlist is also an annoying experience."
10801,AmazonMusic,Enrique C.,1,2,"i could tolerate the constant need to push Amazon Unlimited but recently the app as a music player just doesnt work like it used to. I'm constantly refeshig My Music in the hopes it updates my song list and recently it's marking the songs I copied from the CD as Prime songs that I cant use! That's it,going back to google play music."
10802,AmazonMusic,Jeff Wilcox,1,1,"For months and months now... I'll pick and album, it'll play 2 songs, sometimes if you're lucky 3. Then it dies. Sits there spooling trying to load. Full signal, just won't stream. Close app, reopen, repeat. Gets pretty damned old. Time to start looking for another service."
10803,AmazonMusic,Jesse Gibson,1,108,"Updated 3/14/19: Was listening to my offline music and it randomly logged me out. Apparently the app just doesn't work unless you're logged in. Why? That's really stupid. Fix it if you want a better review Amazon. Updated 12/12/18: They've released an update that makes the widget much more useful now, so I've upped my review to 5 stars. I like the app. Doesn't require amazon prime, but a lot more cool features are available with it."
10804,AmazonMusic,Tia Gonzalez,1,1,"I have always loved this app, but it just doesn't work with my new phone, the Note 9, which is extremely upsetting. Songs don't play when they're supposed to, the app glitches and shuts off, my playlist changes for no reason, and sometimes, I can't even select songs, options, or categories at all. The recent update only made the problems worse. I would really appreciate it if Amazon could fix the bugs associated eith the Note 9."
10805,AmazonMusic,A Google user,2,313,I have addressed this before. An older version of the app use to allow you to sample all new releases and popular songs from the home page. During this time frame I purchased more music because it was easier to know what's out. Now the app requires you to jump through hoops to sample a piece of music by hitting buy song then not buy it. Then you are no longer on list of new releases. Why do app developers feel the need to change things when nothing is broken. Please allow samples from home page.
10806,AmazonMusic,Ben Kahn,3,10,"pretty poorly designed and executed app with a lot of bugs. For example, if no internet access is available, app takes about a minute or more to open, which is a big pain to wait to just start a playlist. It took an hour on the phone with Amazon tech support to get an album I bought from them to show up in the app. app crashes pretty regularly. Buttons in the lock screen stop working if pressed to quickly. The next song button on the lock screen is small and right next to the exit app button..."
10807,AmazonMusic,Stefan Kolesar,3,12,"While I have yet to use the app extensively, after a month or so I'm not regretting my Prime subscription. The more I use it, the more functionality I discover, so I figure for the price it's worthwhile. Edit: After using it a little more, and shelling out for the Unlimited subscription, I'm honestly a little torn. There are a number of songs and artists that simply haven't signed on to the platform, and a number of songs that I can only find certain versions of; IE censored lyrics, live album."
10808,AmazonMusic,Louis A Spain Jr,5,494,"So versatile, so varied, so completely User-friendly. There is nothing you'd like to do with phone music app that isn't already built-in. The inclusion of the lyrics for most of your Amazon downloads even makes it work as a karaoke app. In fact, if there was a way to import the lyrics for even more of the songs, you'd want sing out loud all day:-) Lastly, the dizzying number of suggested playlists generated from personal downloads (from your computer) makes it out-Pandora and Spotify, themselves."
10809,AmazonMusic,Leonie Blakeman,2,3,"It was great when I 1st got it but now it keeps taking all the music I downloaded off me and trying to get me to pay for the unlimited service if I want to listen to them. As I already pay Â£80 per year for the prime service - which music was a part of I'm really upset that they want MORE money to listen to a service that was originally part of prime. Alot of the music they're taking back is really old stuff too, I'd understand if it was up to date music. I'll have no songs left soon!"
10810,AmazonMusic,David Smith,1,2,"With new update, even worse. now stops music when phone screen off. past 3 star One thing that sticks with your app is the constant stopping if your not touching buttons in the app. Google music will play nonstop until I stop it. Most people want a nonstop listening as they are doing something else, if they were in app they would watch videos not play music. I'm a Lyft driver and play music while running Lyft and maps. Please fix issue before I switch back to Google for nonstop listening."
10811,AmazonMusic,Tammy Walker-Thomas,1,12,"This is a Prime Membership ADD ON, NOT A BENEFIT. They're removing more and more music from my play list to get subscriptions. I don't understand why I have to pay for a music subscription if the music is a Membership ""benefit"". The Prime Membership just increased by $20 and now they want money to listen to the music that's supposed to be a Prime benefit."
10812,AmazonMusic,Megan Gonzalez,4,0,"Love just about everything about it. Only 2 things I would change. 1. Occasionally, it just resets and I lose all of my downloads. They're still.in my online music, but I have like 10,000 songs, so it's a pain to redownload a bunch of stuff to listen to offline. 2. I wish it had an intuitive playlist feature (more songs like this one type thing). It has genres and artists, which is great, but sometimes you just want to stay on a specific wave length. otherwise, all awesome!"
10813,AmazonMusic,Roberto Arizmendi,1,5,"Trash.... when you move a song to a playlist, although it says it has moved the song, the song it's not in the playlist... this app will remove songs, a lot of them, without notifying you.. If you do not download your songs, you will loose a great number of them... Amazon does not care anymore of having a great product, they just want your money.. Money from the purchase of the songs, prime and now the unlimited plan... greed sucks..."
10814,AmazonMusic,Andrew C,2,10,I used to use it for purchases only. I have purchased a lot of $5 albums but they stopped those sales to constantly push the subscription. Very disappointed. They rarely have sales so I rarely purchase anything anymore. It's nice to sample music but if the screen ever rotates then sampling stops and you are taken back a few screens to the basic menu! It's very annoying. Bring back the $5 album sale!
10815,AmazonMusic,William Walker,5,0,"Really enjoying the app. Iv'e been looking for a way to buy music and this is exactly what I need. Easy, and legal! Thanks Amazon! 3/22/19 Ok, I'm beginning to get over my initial thrill with this app. I see what yawl' are doing. Your placing more & more songs on the Unlimited plan, and making them unavailable to buy & download. So, I have to buy into the package deal and not even get the advantage of owning my songs? I'm not interested in signing up for anything, I want to BUY music. Period!"
10816,AmazonMusic,Jamie McLaughlin,2,19,"I don't use this app to stream music, but using it to purchase and download music is inconvenient and unreliable. Purchased songs sometimes do not appear in your purchased playlist, and support cannot help. The only solution is to logout, uninstall the app, reinstall and re-login. This will also delete some (but not all) of your previously downloaded music. You also canot paste your password when logging in, so the app is incompatible with password managers."
10817,AmazonMusic,A Google user,1,7,"Constantly overloads my older phone. LG G4. It stutters, skips, slows down and speeds up during songs. playlists are hard to re-order songs. Songs are constantly dropped from playlists. ok Google and Alexa wont talk each other. March 21 2019 update.. App is getting worse. Songs constantly drop off playlists. App is very heavy on my old LG G4. I dont want to upgrade my phone. Songs skip whether stored on microsd card or internal memory. No alexa playlist controls for advance, next ,skip, replay"
10818,AmazonMusic,James Hann,1,10,"I made the mistake of updating this app to the current version and it is now rather broken. it refuses to play music from my Offline library unless I first connect to the internet. which rather defeats the point of an offline library. seeing as I don't have the data limit to constantly be online, I don't see how I'm supposed to use this app now"
10819,AmazonMusic,Tyler Everson,3,1,"Amazing library yet, annoying. I take hours making playlists and removing skits and intros from the library and then I have to uninstall and install. Everytime I make a purchase on the amazon app and add to my library, it won't find the songs. If I purchase an entire album, 50/50 chance of adding to my library. It's individual songs that it does it with everytime. I'm so tired of having to do this I'm not sure I'll install it next time it does it."
10820,AmazonMusic,Greg Thompson,2,1,"This doesn't compare to Spotify, it's probably not even the 3rd or 4th best streaming service. The catalogue of music is lacking in some areas. The search function is poor, it might find an album but then you can't play it. It's algorithms are poor, it keeps recommending music I don't want to listen to and doesn't offer me the opportunity to say I dislike it for future reference. Spend your money on Spotify...this really isn't worth the slight saving."
10821,AmazonMusic,Daryl Chambers,3,1,"The service is adequate. If you want a player for your Amazon music this is probably the simplest solution. However, because they pestered me about rating them (even asking for a 5 star rating), they lost stars. Nobody who asks for a 5 star rating without first asking what you like or dislike about the service first deserves more than 3 stars. Perhaps if everyone starts giving people low ratings when pestered by companies that want a high rating, they will stop pestering people to rate them."
10822,AmazonMusic,Vinny M,4,1,"Decent app, does what it needs to. I'm deducting a star off the rating as it constantly asks me to upgrade to Amazon Music Unlimited almost every time i enter the app. This is extremely annoying. I mean, i pay monthly for this service, and i get the impression they want even more of my money. as i said, its a great app and prime is just awesome, but Amazon needs to stop being greedy like this ðŸ˜•"
10823,AmazonMusic,Sydney,2,127,"I was having problems with my offline and online music, where only certain songs would actually play. I realized that I hadn't updated the app, so I figured that would fix my problem. It did, but it resulted in over half of my downloaded music to say ""this song is no longer available on your device"". What's going on? This app has been amazing for years and then out of nowhere just in the span of 24 hours it's become impossible..."
10824,AmazonMusic,James Marshall,2,52,"Two main issues with this app. 1. It takes ages every time for the app to open (about a minute). This isn't a problem with my phone as I have just renewed my phone and it was the same with my previous phone. 2. Unless someone can tell me how to change the settings, song are generall in alphabetical order and not numerical as the album."
10825,AmazonMusic,Jim Bob,1,15,"Amazon music is literally the worst. I feel like I have my hands tied, because I use Amazon to download music and all the android, mac, and PC apps equally suck. Poor connection, missed downloads, freezing, improper loading, failure to complete purchases, the list goes on and on."
10826,AmazonMusic,Trina Lilly,3,10,"For the most part this is an awesome app, but songs that I liked and added to playlist ended up being taken out for some reason. They become no longer available. I canceled other music apps because I found the artists I liked on Amazon music, and now 50% of those songs have disappeared and I can no longer have access to. This is very disappointing in misleading"
10827,AmazonMusic,ChristiLuv TVâ„¢,3,6,"Excellent app with great features, extensive catalog of songs and very intelligent algorythm to know what you like based on what you like. Plus it offers the ""clean"" version of genre playlists for those of us who prefer not to hear monotonously or frivilously abrasive lyrics for an hour straight. But the app keeps crashing on every device i play it on, be it my android phone or my amazon firestick-- and thats a pretty basic, fundamental problem. Sooooo good content / bad delivery: #TechFail"
10828,AmazonMusic,Nathan Rockabrand,2,9,"This app can be useful, but the layout is counterintuitive and still difficult for me to follow even after years of me using it. It's also buggy as hell and has recently plagued me download issues. Sometimes I download an album and it's nowhere to be found. The little icon in the app says I downloaded it so I can't try again, and I have to call customer service to get it sorted. Lame."
10829,AmazonMusic,Frederick Kuechenmeister,3,0,"Could be great. Merely good. The suspension of play can get annoying, especially on road trips, 'you've been away from the app for a while' no i haven't, im driving, now i have to attend to you so i can get my music back, distracting me from driving. Not a good thing. No longer seeing any sales either, which is unfortunate, and recommendations can be a bit off 'you listened to Napalm Death, how about Cardi B?!?' no... just... no.."
10830,AmazonMusic,David Atwood,3,146,"App works great, but they keep adding ways to get more money out of you. I joined Amazon Prime when it first started and I love it, well I used to. They used to have their music available to everyone with a great selection of music. Then a bunch of music started disappearing from the available menu. Then out of the blue they added a new service to get all the songs I used to get for an additional price per month. Now this in in addition to what I'm already paying. Nickle and Dime me."
10831,AmazonMusic,Craig Rutkowske,4,32,"This application is constantly improving and quite quickly in my experience. It does some basic things well, but it has a ton of end user experience issues.  The good: -Tons of music -Cheaper than Spotify -Provides access to numerous people -Speedy updates -On screen lyrics are nice and timed well when available  Room for improvement: -I would prefer a rework of the Add to Queue and the Play Next buttons. Just get rid of Add to queue. I can't imagine why I would want to add a song to the bottom of a 200 song queue. -Cross fade between songs would be a nice addition. -When the app doesn't have a good connection, even if I have a song downloaded, it tends to randomly stop playing and start again."
10832,AmazonMusic,Michael Lewis,1,6,"when playing downloaded music it will occasionally stop and restart after a few seconds. like it lost wifi connection, which shouldnt be the case because these are songs downloaded to my phone. I looked at the app while this was happening and the play button had turned into the swirling circle like it was searching for signal. This is ridiculous because the songs are already downloaded."
10833,AmazonMusic,Hrishikesh Shukla,2,2,"Date: 18-02-19. Overall a good app, but why am I not able to access the player from my notification area or even the lock screen. the basic concept of a music player is that it enables the user to access it without opening the app again and again. Instead this app has not provided the very basic feature. Device Samsung S9 Plus. Same issue on android 8 and now on android 9."
10834,AmazonMusic,Patrick Bourque,3,1,"I like it, but to begin with I had access to more music and now it's actually been taken away. Now I can pay for premium and have access back plus a hell of of a lot more. But now I have to use Amazon paid to use it :( so I feel a bit cheated there. right now all I use is my Amazon Prime. they give you something great and then they tell you you can't have it after what you had, then you can have something more, but pay big bucks already on what I I've already paid....."
10835,AmazonMusic,redbeardsaint,5,1,I still buy my music on CD because I like the artwork and it makes me feel more in touch with the artist. as far as I know Amazon music and Amazon are the only place you can buy the disc or vinyl and also own the mp3. This insures you own the music forever regardless of whether the subscription lapses or the platform (like zune) disintegrates. For me there's nowhere else I would pay for a subscription. In addition the reccomendations and keeping up with new releases is spot on.
10836,AmazonMusic,Athelstan BastardKing,2,1,"The app works pretty well but I continuously see more and more content disappear and I have Unlimited. Why? In the last week 2/3 of American Hustle soundtrack has become ""no longer available on this device."" That is not unlimited. I pay my monthly fee for an unlimited music service. I cannot see disappearing or unavailable content as unlimited."
10837,AmazonMusic,Sharon Ahrens,3,1,"Rating the app itself, not the music library behind the app. The app only shuffles by the first letter of the song title - for example only shuffles through songs that start with ""B"". Pretty unsatisfying. Also they need to add an equalizer, like the PowerAmp app. And they need to dynamically adjust the sound level of each song, like iTunes supposedly does. Finally, the Amazon app crashes often, sometimes as much as 5 times per day."
10838,AmazonMusic,Andrew Powell,1,30,"The album I listened to is called ""55 top hits workout music"" but Amazon only lists 32 songs that are actually available to listen to, it shows the others songs but skips over them. If an album is listed and available then I'd like the entire album to be available. There was no mention of needing to upgrade to unlimited to get the other songs, it simply appeared that parts of the album were blocked."
10839,AmazonMusic,A Google user,1,6,ridiculous. bought an album (crooks). won't download on my galaxy like other music. tried buying it again. now the whole app is freezing. I have to go through all of this butt-ache and it's still not working. ow I'll have to cancel the purchase all together
10840,AmazonMusic,A Google user,4,68,"Access to Prime Music is unexpectedly great. Much of what I want is available there. Integration with Echo devices is also a big plus, but that still has a few annoying bugs. The only other annoyance is the ads that the app pops up to sell me the Amazon Music service."
10841,AmazonMusic,M Walsh,1,7,Hangs all the time on all my devices used to be a good app but increasingly all I see is the spinning wheel. It can take 3 or 4 mins to do something as simple as add a song to a playlist or access an album. Have tried reinstalling but same issues. Avoid it's so poor I am cancelling my subscription to Amazon music.
10842,AmazonMusic,Brooke S,1,10,Amazon music sucks 10/10 would not recommend. a lot of there music is disappearing and on the family plan for music your account is removed once you get a new phone so you lose all of your music and have to reconnect it to your main family account if doing so. Spotify will at least keep your playlist and music when you aren't paying so you can actually listen and see everything you've downloaded at least where as now I have to mine again Amazon sucks and I'm sad they are trying to take over.
10843,AmazonMusic,Trucking Fan,5,8,love Amazon music. I actually dj ed for about 20years 80s right up to millennial probably had the best years of the music. got rather sick of it at the time now at this very moment I get into bed and listen to all the music I used to play and helps me sleep bit like reading a Good book. THANKS AMAZON.
10844,AmazonMusic,Rogue Viking,1,96,Terrible! you still need to either buy songs or purchase amazon unlimited music for $8/month. can't listen to all music by single artist; only album by the artist (even if pay for unlimited package) I would rather have the free version of either spotify or pandora than the paid version of Amazon music... very disappointed and honestly very pisses off about even trying it out!
10845,AmazonMusic,Meg Cockcroft,3,0,"I like that you can pick any song with out paying. However, I HATE how to remove songs. It's annoying to have to go to the artist, or album just to delete it. Why can't I just delete the song from my music. another thing that's weird is that of uou download a song, you can't add it to any playlist except offline..... or you have to go to the artist, or album to add it to an online playlist. Very frustrating."
10846,AmazonMusic,Cynthia Sanchez,1,9,"I was really excited to find old songs that I grew up with and that I had a hard time finding. At first I was loving this app but then a few weeks from using it many of my songs were deleted for no reason! I had over 1,000 songs saved and Amazon reduced it to less then 250 songs! the app needs to fix that glitch in the system! especially because I am paying for the songs!"
10847,AmazonMusic,Jon N.,4,23,"So far so good. realized that some albums like watch the throne aren't fully available. could use an update that actually plays the select song I click on vs me clicking it and it play something else from my list. Also I'm a Amazon prime member so unlimited music should be included. the owner cleared over 11 billion in taxes this year soooooo yeah, give prime members unlimited music. thank you."
10848,AmazonMusic,James Dibble,2,0,"Pretty terrible. If there was an app that needed a rehash, it's this one. It wont recognize purchased music, switches between online and offline music by itself, won't recognize playlists between them, and the widget just doesnt work... that's only a few I've listed from the many I've noticed. This is terrible from a company that makes billions and can afford to fix the app with the taxes they don't pay."
10849,AmazonMusic,Ben Sims,4,0,"While this is my go-to music app and has a great selection, it does have a couple problems. The UI can be a bit clunky on mobile, especially for creating or adding to playlists, and songs that you have in your playlists are randomly taken down and made unavailable, even if you downloaded it, usually with the same song being available on a different release or album, so you have to periodically clean and update your playlists to deal with the missing songs."
10850,AmazonMusic,Zerk,3,3,"Pro: The huge selection is great for finding out if I like artists before I buy music. Con: Useless without an internet connection (like on an airplane) even if you downloaded the music you paid for. Without a connection, it'll play half a dozen of your *paid for, downloaded* songs, then stop and tell you there's no internet. Duh! That's why I downloaded my *paid for* music!"
10851,AmazonMusic,Tuyet Do,4,25,"i like this app very much. i get to pick my own songs, and app still running even when phone screen off, that saves battery. the ONE thing i DONT like about this app is that there IS NOT an option for me to replay a song several times. there's an option to replay the whole playlist, but not one single song. if i want to hear a song repeatedly, i have to add it individually into a playlist, thats cumbersome."
10852,AmazonMusic,Karen Anderson,5,89,There is so much music available to listen to! I use this app all the time. It's nice to be able to hear albums before u buy them to see if u would even want to. It's also nice if u r broke but still want access to great music. My only real complaint is the constant ads begging me to upgrade to the premium app. I can't afford it and it's super annoying.
10853,AmazonMusic,"Yeah, same to you",1,4,This app forces you to give A LOT of your personal information like your street name and your apartment no. before you can use it. This is totally ridiculous. Why do you need so much of my personal info? Why do the ppl that made this app give me their personal details first before they try to ask me tons of NY personal details? Totally ridiculous!
10854,AmazonMusic,Jarid Clapp,2,18,they keep taking songs in my playlist and moving them to 'music unlimited' and asking me to pay a monthly fee to listen to the songs I was already listening to. as far as I am concerned if you are a prime member then you should have full access to the music as long as you play it through an Amazon device. This service started out good but has been failing rapidly.
10855,AmazonMusic,Alecia Keegan,2,1,Probably switching to a different streaming music app. Don't like songs disappearing from my Playlist and even more so do I not like my music being interrupted and getting the blue wheel of disappointment!! So I will be canceling my account. I shouldn't have to pay for low quality. My carrier insists it's not them... I believe it is both. Spramazon!!
10856,AmazonMusic,Graham Penson,4,1,"Good selection of music of all genres, easy to search and downloadable for playing off line ( I used it overseas with no issues). The main reason for not getting 5* is that there is no option for gapless playback. This is important for a lot of the music I listen to, and especially for live albums to keep the ambience of the event as well as hearing the music."
10857,AmazonMusic,Nikki,3,29,"Good music selection and playlists but app is very unstable. it frequently crashes. The screen widget also randomly stops responding when you're trying to skip songs during playback, forcing you to unlock the phone and open the main app. This is really annoying and defeats the purpose of having a widget. I'd expect better stability from a paid for subscription service."
10858,AmazonMusic,Jenn Leavell,2,1,This app works great when online. The latest update (in November) has caused issues with being able to download music and play it back on your devices. I sat online for over an hour and a half and talked with 6 people trying to resolve this issue. I was told this is an issue across Fire devices and they are working on it. I have had this issue since November. Do not buy unlimited music if you are hoping to play downloaded music when you are not online. No longer a satisfied customer.
10859,AmazonMusic,rebecca cortez,3,1,"I like that there are no ads and there are unlimited skips, but I pay for an annual Prime membership and an extra $6 a month for Prime music, and songs have dropped off my playlist that were there before because they are no longer available, and I can only stream from one device at a time. for as much money as I pay for Amazon, these things should not be a problem. It's extremely disappointing, and I'm currently searching for music elsewhere."
10860,AmazonMusic,Grouch 1,5,0,"App works like its supposed to. Many songs are not available unless your paying for the Unlimited subscription, which is what I had to do. Other apps play the songs I don't have access to here, but you don't have control of the music itself with rewind, forward and replay etc. It has options like any other music player, but no ads and option to download music for offline use and it takes up less space. It's worth a try for those with Prime."
10861,AmazonMusic,Andrew Goulet,1,1,Please fix the shuffle option. It doesn't really shuffle all music plays in order of download every time I hit shuffle. I understand it's free with Amazon prime membership but make it worth our time and money. It's terrible that Pandora music free does better than this. Embarassing.
10862,AmazonMusic,Angel Duncan,4,0,"I love having the hands-free music experience when I'm doing housework, cooking or driving. I can ask Alexa to play whatever song, artist or genre I want and have it played on any blutooth device, headphones, in my car or streaming through my Echo! And, I LOVE my ""soundtrack"" that Amazon creates based on my music preferences! The only reason I gave 4 stars is because even though they do have an amazing selection of music, they don't have the selection of Spotify, with lesser-known artists."
10863,AmazonMusic,Cameron Cole,3,2,this is a okay music service . i know it comes part of a package of benifits you get with amazon prime . i didn't realize that you don't have access to the entire music library which is a bummer and to get ultimate you have to pay almost as much as you would for a spotify premium service which is far superior with better functionality and a larger library . one pro to amazon music is that it doesn't have adds that is why I will continue to use the service.
10864,AmazonMusic,Daniel Henrickson,5,4,All the features I wished for with other services for years are here. Via Alexa it is a whole new experience in music entertainment. The selection and user friendly options can't be beat and for a very low cost. I signed up through my echo dot for $4 a month and just upgraded to $7.99 so that I could use on my mobile. Paired that with some Bluetooth headphones I recently got off Amazon prime my public transit journeys got a whole lot better ðŸ˜‰.
10865,AmazonMusic,Ryan Goodwin,3,20,"Good app but very buggy, sometimes won't let you erase music you've downloaded, this has been an issue for months. Also sometimes very slow to respond even on a fast wifi connection at home. will not display content of albums sometimes unless you uninstall and install again."
10866,AmazonMusic,Christina Pruett,3,6,"I like the selection of music just fine, but the player not so much. I don't really like how it always restarts the song after not being on for a while, and every time you want to start the app after not using it for a while, it takes SEVERAL taps to get it to start. And you can't listen to the music on a different player, it HAS to be the Amazon app music player. Other than that, good app."
10867,AmazonMusic,Lisa Mayers,3,1,"Ok 3.5/5 then. I would rate it higher but whenever I reopen the app it keeps snapping back to the beginning of my music library, not the last song i played in one of my playlists, and it switches to shuffle when I reopen too. Sometimes mislabelling means it can't find songs. The search function could be a bit more forgiving of spelling mistakes and it should be able to find songs by the first line or a chorus. Otherwise it's fine."
10868,AmazonMusic,Mark H.,4,19,"Amazon Music App isn't too bad. Works as expected, for the most part. Needs improvement (or better instructions on use). 1) When playing, can't use the progress slider to jump to a desired spot in the song. 2) How can I play just ONE song then have it stop without continuing onto the next. I've tried everything. 3) Haven't figures out how to move multiple songs to playlists at once. NEWBIE, maybe. But, I've used dozens of player apps, so I think I know how this should work. That's it for now."
10869,AmazonMusic,Jenny Piasecki,2,1,"The only reason I dished money for ""unlimited"" was because my favorite songs weren't included with Prime. Amazon just took half my favorite songs out of my music because it's ""no longer available "" when I was paying to access it in the first place. I am canceling my subscription and would like to be refunded for this month, because I feel like I was cheated out of my money when I'm not getting what I paid for. It could have gone toward something useful, like a flu shot."
10870,AmazonMusic,Steven Davis,3,1,I have been using Amazon music for the last couple years. I'm a Prime member so of course it was a reasonable consideration. I give it three stars because it seems that it constantly wants to push me into buying new music that I really have no interest in. It is somewhat but see to get back to your regular library and listen to the music that I want. They're also are a number of songs that I upload it to this library that is simply will not play. When I put them on Google Play they seemed to work
10871,AmazonMusic,Crystal Kemp,2,1,I would give more stars but the fact that my app icon disappeared and I wrote over a month ago asking how to get it back and gotten no response makes me not as satisfied about the app. I have to go into Google play and search for Amazon music every time I want to get access. Other than that it's great but inconvenient. Would be nice to get an answer.
10872,AmazonMusic,A Google user,2,1,"Although I am able to access almost all music, a few weeks ago I was going to play my music and more than half of it was gone. When I clicked on it, it said ""to unlock this song, you need to go unlimited for so and so a month"". Up until this point, almost everything on the app was completely free. I am considering switching back to Spotify now.ðŸ˜•"
10873,AmazonMusic,Adrian Sandoval,2,1,"this was a great app but now they just want to charge for everything. they already raised the price for prime ( which i pay). now they want another 96 bucks to hear music i i use to be able to hear most of already, with out the subscription. so for that reason 2 stars. all the artist station now have to subscribe to listen to use to be free."
10874,AmazonMusic,mindy fussner,5,229,"I love being able to listen to the music that I used to have on my albums, cassettes and cd's all in one place. Just about every song and/or album I've searched for has been found and is right at my fingertips. Since I'm not a very technological person, Amazon Music makes it very simple. Thank you!"
10875,AmazonMusic,shawn wright williams,5,0,"I luv Amazon Music. I luv that I have on Demand 24/7 access to it. I listen to it while I'm at work, at home in my car and even for Sunday morning service. I really luv the variety, the vast options & choices. I mean the various Genres and Artists are unbelievable and I like a wide range of music. And to top it all off; No commercials, No ads. In my opinion, by far the Best Music App out there. ðŸ‘â¤ðŸ‘ðŸ˜ŠðŸ™"
10876,AmazonMusic,Joseph Jenkins,4,1,it's really a great platform for music. it's just that I wish they could get music faster. some artist music will drop on a friday but they wont get it for a day or 2 later maybe even 3 as compared to other platforms for music. if they got that right then by all means 5 stars.
10877,AmazonMusic,Dave Reinhard,5,3,This is the musical experience long dreamed of. Being a Prime member is a no-brainer these days. Amazon doesn't rest on its laurels either. They are looking to constantly improve and add value. Prime music is something all music lovers should have and give thanks for!
10878,AmazonMusic,kaylyn shipman,2,1,"the music selection is awesome, however ANY time I try to play the music, it skips like a CD that is scratched and automatically shuts off.. google play music is SO much better because of this issue. if Amazon fixes the issue, 5 stars will be awarded. That is my only complaint."
10879,AmazonMusic,Walker Matrix,5,2,I don't know why I didn't sign up for this sooner. way better than Spotify and Pandora. Much cleaner user interface and Android app. The presentation is spot-on. Also has more music than the other two popular services. I highly recommend this to anyone that is a music lover. Well worth the money.
10880,AmazonMusic,Christopher Pruett,2,0,"I used this service for a few months, they had my favorite obscure band and most of their songs with some behind the paywall. However after some time they deleted my favorite album available to me from this artist and I could no longer access these songs. So I switched to Spotify and they have ALL of my artists songs. I won't be coming back to this service. Just switch to Spotify, much more worth your time."
10881,AmazonMusic,Andrew L,3,0,"The updates, especially the recent ones, create really weird playlists and keep switching them. for example, the recently added went from actually recently added to all of my songs, and it's not even the order that I added them. Sometimes the album cover changes or something changes with the song I guess but amazing x's it out of your songs and you really can only tell if you happen to see it greyed out, and it tells you the song isn't available so you have to go search for it and re-add it."
10882,AmazonMusic,Robert Wood,1,1,"used to be the best. now, its ssssllllloooowwwwwwwwww af. plus,if you ever have any issues, which us ALL THE TIME NOW, and you decide to uninstall/reinstall, it deletes all of what you've downloaded INCLUDING everything you bought/paid for. of course since you paid for it, you can always download it again but ive now wasted terabytes of data redownloading everything. SUCH A HEADACHE. If i hadnt already invested the thousands of dollars over the yrs i would never use this again. but all of my mus"
10883,AmazonMusic,Goose Ragu,3,5,I'm an Amazon Prime user and Amazon Music was a part of being a member. Now Amazon is using this new Music Unlimited service to charge more money. They also started blacking out certain artists and songs that used go be available previously through an Amazon Prime membership. The original service is decent minus the songs that are no longer available through a Prime membership. Shame on such a big company to nickel and dime loyal customers.
10884,AmazonMusic,Ro W,2,65,"Wish they could have left things alone. It was great before they added the new music unlimited but now they want you to pay more, even after raising the prime annual rates. I miss having access to unlimited stations and I'm considering canceling prime all together and switching to another music streaming app. The perk is no commercials."
10885,AmazonMusic,Summer Falls,2,2,"A lot of the music that is new Amazon doesn't have access to. Which is not good for me because I enjoy listening to several genres of music. Also, I own a great deal of the music that I listen to and it doesn't show up in my device, Amazon would rather you purchase the music or sign up for a subscription than have a catalog of your own music in which you uploaded yourself but when clicking on the song it states buy song. Why would I buy it when I purchased it already? Amazon needs more research"
10886,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,16,"Great...It has Apple Music beat hands down. Amazon Music is user friendly and easy to navigate the app. Apple music on the other hand was not very user friendly and extremely difficult to navigate the menu. I get Apple Music free with my Verizon plan, but I will not use it because Amazon Music by far is the best all around."
10887,AmazonMusic,A Google user,4,3,"Great music app! Only downside, is I'd like a little more parental control to dare let my kids use it unsupervised. You can block explicit music, but not all explicit music is marked explicit. And many album covers to non-explicit music are definitely not kid-friendly."
10888,AmazonMusic,Tracie Peters,5,1,I'm an Amazon Prime not an Unlimited subscriber. The music selection is still extensive even with the limited access. Suggestions are made based on music listened to which is handy. I love music and having access through a subscription that's used for much more is great. It's basically 'free' as a perk with my regular Amazon Prime. 5 stars us well earned.
10889,AmazonMusic,James K. Bishop,1,1,"Amazon Music is device-based not account-based. Your activity history is unique to each device. If you uploaded your own music to their cloud before they ended that service in 2018, you will endure ""Synching your music..."" and experience agonizing delays in browsing or searching your music. The app itself looks beautiful, but the user experience is hampered by the architecture of the service. I have Amazon Music as a Prime member, but I would not pay $8/mo for the ""Unlimited"" product."
10890,AmazonMusic,A Google user,4,1,"Better than YouTube. No annoying ads and and an endless variety of artists, albums and genres. plus I can use other apps on my phone without interrupting the music. The only thing I don't like about it is we're already paying for Amazon Prime and yet many of the songs are blocked out. If we want the really good songs we have to pay extra. I call BS on that one."
10891,AmazonMusic,coach mcgillis,1,7,"this app gives me terminal cancer. the ones behind it should be shot and this app pulled from the store. it will stay on the loading screen for minutes, songs will buffer indefinetely regardless of the network, if you have a song in queue and want to add it to a playlist you have to remove it from queue first"
10892,AmazonMusic,A Paul B,3,0,"you can not delete more than one song at a time. i often download entire albums of stand up comedy but once you hear it once or twice, you really dont need it in the middle if your music so i delete them. the problem is you can only delete 1 track at a time. That takes a really long time when its 5 or 6 albums with 15 to 20 tracks per album. its like deleting 80 tracks one by one. extremely lame"
10893,AmazonMusic,catsupcups,3,0,"this is a great app for listening to music offline. only 3 stars because navigating this app is infuriating. you can go to an artist by tapping the misc options on one of their songs, but not if it's through your saved music. you can add music to your collection while looking at an album, but have to go back to your collection and tap the same button that was at the album page to remove it."
10894,AmazonMusic,Alan Aran,3,0,"It replaced Pandora as my go-to music app since it was supposed to be a prime feature but the app stops playback to ask ""Are you still listening?"" even though I've been skipping/replaying songs and whatnot while driving. So, Either Take your eyes off the road to access your phone to press 'yes', endangering yourself and everyone else to continue the service, or sit in dead silence the rest of the trip while fuming. I get the licensing thing, this is very inconvenient."
10895,AmazonMusic,Jon Casey,5,1,"Pretty impressive collective, from seemingly endless genres. One suggestion that I do have, is in regards to the My Music lists (i.e., Playlists, Artists, etc.) They don't automatically update those lists, whenever those albums or songs (that you took the time to find and save into one, EPIC list) just, suddenly disappear, one day. Usually, all songs from specific albums...greyed-out. It's frustrating. : ( Why-not just delete them from ALL lists, if you can't replace them? Its easier, for all."
10896,AmazonMusic,Ray Fetick,3,96,"music continuously becomes unavailable, but you can still go find it again. you just cant play it from your playlist anymore. that's kinda a pain. other than that it's pretty decent has more available music than Google play. I just dont like having to go re-find songs every few weeks or couple months because amazon updated and removed that song in that version."
10897,AmazonMusic,Daniel Ewing,3,1,"Its a covenient way to load amazon purchases onto my phone. It used to work better, but now is often slow to connect, even when i have good signal, and without connecting it will not open or play music, even if that music is stored on your phone. Its frequently slow enough that I just close it and play my stored music on google play. It also, annoyingly, requires that you turn down the free trial of their paid service EVERY time you open it."
10898,AmazonMusic,Novarian Nexus,4,1,"I've been using this app for over 2 years and love the freedom of choosing your songs whenever, wherever. Plus the offline library is rather nice. (But does have some song limitations for whatever reason) Besides the offline library nuisance ,the only thing else keeping this from being 5 stars is that fact that amazon prime memebers don't get Music Unlimited free. Shelling out $10 a month just to listen to more songs when i already pay a yearly fee with prime. The app is great, I like it, get it"
10899,AmazonMusic,Chotu Chaiwala,3,9,I listen to most of my music through this app and to be honest it is okay for that sole purpose but at times it makes me really angry. If a song in my playlist is added to an album it gets removed my from my playlist and I have to add it again which is really annoying. Also the UI of the app looks like it was made in 2010.
10900,AmazonMusic,Badbenson,4,1,"Great app some minor issues such as it will not allow you to make the widget the length of the screen and you cannot access your library through the widget it will just close the app if you try, the back button don't restart a song but rather bounces back to the previous one no matter what. and it will not play in the background if you close the app while listening it will stop resets shuffle as well. however, amazon has the most expansive library i have encountered and is well worth it."
10901,AmazonMusic,Bryan Martinez,1,2,I am an amazon prime client. I would assume that that membership would include all music access but instead you want to charge me more for music i want to listen to. It's a shame that amazon wants me to sign up for unlimited music access rather than include it with my Amazon prime account. Is there no combined charge for both that is reasonable? Why do we have to pay for both separately? And why is it so expensive when i dont use prime that much .....? honestly im second guessing my subscription.
10902,AmazonMusic,Dane Whitsett,3,1,"This app has a wide variety of music that ranges from mainstream to unknown artists. To be honest, I would rate the app much higher if the Amazon CO didn't occasionally clear downloaded music when their online library changes. For someone who pays for Amazon Prime and a monthly Amazon Music membership, I know how one-sided those actions are. However, overall a good app for music. Minor crashes, good selection."
10903,AmazonMusic,Patrick Fillmore,3,1,"Amazon music app is good for streaming, bad for downloaded music. the shuffle all song feature is inferior to Google play - this one makes a total list rather than a running list, which means if you are shuffling music and want to add a song to the list, it's years from now. if you have a big library, shuffle only shuffles the first part of it, so you'll get lots of a artists and b artists, but no z artists."
10904,AmazonMusic,Jesse Raines,3,1,"if you plan on paying for the membership, DONT. you would be better off going to apple music or some other app, just because you pay for the subscription doesnt mean that you actually own the music they can take it off without warning. the moment you stop paying for the membership you lose all your music that requires the membership."
10905,AmazonMusic,sarah bromley,5,1,Took on as a free trial and is one of the very rare occasions that I've kept the service. I use it alot with my various echo devices and my sons also love the service. All genres are represented and a great variety of playlists if you dont want to listen to some artist or band specific. I do wish there was a discount for the unlimited service as i also have a prime subscription so a reduced price for prime members would be excellent. Recommended music service A**
10906,AmazonMusic,Ben Page,2,0,"edit: as of 03/04/2019 when connected to bluetooth device if my phone locks the music goes jumpy. trying to resolve through Amazon customer service at the moment. It is a pain deleting downloaded music from this app. Are there any plans to make this easier? On other services you can pretty much delete any downloaded song by clicking on the 3 dots which open up the sub menu, this is not the case on Amazon music. Really annoying! if it wasn't for that I would rate 5 stars."
10907,AmazonMusic,Yvonne Lopez,1,10,"When playing music in the car or listening thru headphones it'll just stop. I've force stopped the app and reopened it as your site suggests to do, but that has not worked either. It's very frustrating if it continues I will definitely cancel my subscription."
10908,AmazonMusic,Sam S.,5,0,"One of the best things about a Prime membership is the Amazon Music subscription that is included! Amazon Music contains an exhaustive array of music & it is rare that I don't find a song that I want to hear. I've tested it out by searching for obscure songs from my childhood & most the time, I find what I'm looking for! I had a paid subscription to Beats, & then to Apple Music & then to Google Play Music & while all of those had a more robust music selection, I'd rather save my $!"
10909,AmazonMusic,Mackenzie Wayne,2,0,"All the recent updates haven't saved the issues I've had with this app and, if anything, have made them worse. As many other users have mentioned, I've had downloaded music disappear. My ""recent"" music has cleared multiple times, despite me using the app every single day. The most frustrating issue these days? Music will stop playing at random. No prompt, no reason. I've also reopened the app, not from being closed, but just in another app while it plays, and my music has randomly reset. Fix it."
10910,AmazonMusic,Rachel Hickman,5,0,"My day would not be the same without Amazon Music! I listen to it off and on all day to help me breeze through various daily tasks. At night, I switch to one of Amazon's more mellow stations or one of my playlists, set the in-app timer, and drift off to sleep. We have the family pass so my kids listen to it as well. Amazon has EVERY kind of music from Ambient jazz to Zydeco and every imaginable genre in between!"
10911,AmazonMusic,Jeremy Stone,3,0,"What if you dont want prime? Are you forever going to have to navigate around all the prime obstacles in order to find where they hid the music store? Amazon music is definitely the best value out there. For the love of God let me actually opt out of all the prime requests. I just want to browse music that I can purchase. I don't want to have to click back and forth through different menus in order to find music for sale. Alexa? If you're listening, please don't."
10912,AmazonMusic,John Swan,3,0,"Good selection of music, app mediocre - it's a little unstable and crash and doesn't always process music that you own smoothly. I've had to uninstall and reinstall twice in a year which means a lot of repeat downloading. But the choice is good and if you want Prime membership you get a lot of music free, which is its biggest plus for me. Overall recommended."
10913,AmazonMusic,A Google user,3,1,"Amazon asked me to rate their app with 5 stars. Unfortunately, the app is pretty crappy, the music selection is mediocre, the play lists are rarely/never updated, there are annoying ads (sign up for amazon prime music), and it is slow and buggy (cant delete downloaded music, because sd card is gone--but, I don't have an sd card!). The only reason to use it is that I have an amazon prime account and basic streaming is included. Otherwise, spotify is one or two classes better."
10914,AmazonMusic,Donny Wiggins,4,33,"Great app, but it won't let me listen to a few songs in my library, even though I own them. It just says ""error try again later"". Other than that, it's perfect. Even if you don't own any music you can still listen offline. I love having the lyrics too. Overall, it would be 5 stars, but as of now I cannot listen to all of my music despite owning it. 4 stars for now."
10915,AmazonMusic,Richard Howell,1,0,"Would be better if when you put music in your list they would match the volume across all the songs instead on having to turn the volume up and down. Pandora and iTunes have had this for years. Also, it would be nice to not have to pay an extra $79/year on top of the $120/year that prime already costs. I can understand a little extra, but that seems excessive in order to keep the music you've already been listening to."
10916,AmazonMusic,Aaron Swink,4,11,"The price and song quality is good. Nice to have the option to download the music for offline listening. I had to nick it a star because the selection of music, compared to other streaming music apps, is lacking. It is an easy to use app that looks good. I recommend at least the trial period to make sure it has the music you want."
10917,AmazonMusic,Harry Edwards,5,2,"it's great, I enjoy almost every type of music. this gives me the ultimate venue for music. The most important thing of ALL, KEEP IT AFFORDABLE with a few incentives from time to time. listening to Euge Groove (Actual name Eugene Grove) while rating this app. Euge is one of my favorite jazz artists. Super Great App. Keep it Great."
10918,AmazonMusic,Arvinder Singh Rooprai,5,1,"I can find music for all moods here... Best category is Bollywood Long Drive songs... Now I don't have to download them for my long drives. Just click on the category and ""boom"" all best songs with right mood of long drive are here.... Best part is the list/category gets updated time to time... Apart from this category, I also tried listening to the (English) country music and believe me it was treat to listen to it. Had I not been on this app, I would have never tried it. For me it a 5star app"
10919,AmazonMusic,A Google user,3,20,its good when the music is available. had a bunch of artists' albums downloaded but now most are removed and no longer play. most of Black lable society is not available anymore. not sure if im going to continue using the app or not. im sure diffrent ones are better just for the fact of a better music choice.
10920,AmazonMusic,Ash J,4,5,"Proactive good collection of tunes. Happy to get most of them in here. However thr app needs to get better, esp Alexa, if the app is in forefront why bother calling Alexa, its faster and reliable to manually get it done. If EQ can be integrated, that will blow away even the standalone apps."
10921,AmazonMusic,Peter Diamond,2,0,"far far too glitchy to recommend. I'm often left with nothing but a spinning loading icon and a blank screen. and that's BEFORE I go on line. it's a good app for people who don't want to listen to music, but if like me you want to be able to access music, I'd suggest any other music service. and no, it's not my internet connection. it's a good connection and works fine with any other web service."
10922,AmazonMusic,Alex Martinez,1,0,"I want to unsubscribe but I don't know how. There is no option to unsubscribe on the app. When I choose a song and the song ends it doesn't keep playing song like it, it just stops. Same thing happens when i choose an album. If I choose an artist , it only plays songs the artist is in, which is cool but there should be an option where you can hear music like the artist. There is a lot I don't like about this app but I'm not going to get into it all. All I want is to unsubscribe. Warning to all"
10923,AmazonMusic,rob neil,3,13,"Generally ok, but will only let me listen to my music 1 track at a time on sonos without first creating a playlist. Some features are excellent. I love the offline mode, something that Apple music doesn't offer, but listen mostly at home via sonos, so I will definitely find the lack of ""shuffle all"" on my music annoying. Even if I use my alexa app, it doesn't work, neither does casting to my device. 5 stars if the addition of a simple shuffle/play all button with 3rd party speakers happens."
10924,AmazonMusic,Nabnit Kumar Mishra,1,40,"The app for Android has a strange bug. When the music is playing on the Amazon music app in background, & if the audio focus on the phone changes to some other app (ex: if I get a call, or play a video on WhatsApp or YouTube) the music is muting and not starting again after the audio focus shifts back to the Amazon music app. Ideally, if such scenario occurs where I get a call in between the song or play a video in between the song, the song should pause & play from that very point automatically"
10925,AmazonMusic,A Google user,2,3,"The Amazon Music app, when it works, is great. But the app has new issues with every update, when used with a Chromecast Audio. Examples: 1) Playback stops after a few minutes. 2) Unable to connect with Chromecast Audio. Spotify never has any of these issues, in my experience, with Chromecast Audio. Please improve your quality control Amazon."
10926,AmazonMusic,Neil Ashton,5,2,"Love the music, love the choices. As part of my Amazon Prime membership, I'm able to pull up music that fits my mood anytime. I have a day at work each week when I shut off the phone, put on headphones, and listen to this music while I clear away the accumulated paperwork. Great way to block interruptions."
10927,AmazonMusic,Christopher Stapleton,3,5,It's generally okay and works most of the time. I like the incorporated lyrics but they don't always work. sometimes they'll scroll in time and sometimes they won't scroll at all (not on certain songs .... it's random). Sometimes it will stop part way through a song and say there's an issue with the file ... there isn't. Restart the ap and it'll play fine.
10928,AmazonMusic,Rob,3,1,"Too many glitches and inability to stream music, even music already downloaded in my phone. I do like the ability to cast music, but please go back the ootiin to choose to cast before we push play so that the song starts from the beginning when it casts. In current way, you have to push play and then pause the music and then choose cast after the song has already started."
10929,AmazonMusic,Alec Cridland,1,1,"Popping sounds on music played offline over then last 4 years on different devices. Numerous random bugs coming and going all the time (music notification bar disappearing and not playing the next track while phone is locked to name a few) and all with a slow, unintuitive, bloated user interface that's not pleasant to navigate. For a company like Amazon to have such a subpar music app like this is laughable. Use it for free and pay for a subscription on providers with better apps. That's my take"
10930,AmazonMusic,Josh Walraven,2,1,"loved it at first.. used to be included with your Amazon Prime account. I was in heaven. then they changed it to Prime Music... costing another 7 bucks. not sure if the price has went up, but they have albums up then take them down. Or get to to purchase them now even after i have had that album for years on my account/playlist. greedy asses."
10931,AmazonMusic,Olu Amo,3,40,"I enjoy using the app, however when searching for songs you have to remember the exact name of the Artist or Song, that's really old school and should be worked on. Also, the music archive for global music is limited, hit me up if you need archives on international music from the 80s-90s."
10932,AmazonMusic,David Smith,4,0,"the selection is great , only knocked it down from five stars because although it works pretty well most of the time, it occasionally will pause for no apparent reason, sometimes multiple times within a minute or less ( not just when streaming, with music I downloaded from the site also). if not for that glitch, five stars"
10933,AmazonMusic,Kelly Lowder,5,0,"I tried the 3 mo. trial for $0.99. It is the best dollar I ever spent, and I am now a monthly subscriber. I gave-up on the radio years ago. Don't get me wrong. There is good stuff on the radio, but it's always the same. With Amz Music I get the radio hits and the rest of those albums, plus I have discovered many artists, across many genres, I was not even aware of until now. As a musician, music teacher and music aficionado, the app is well worthwhile."
10934,AmazonMusic,Janet Millard,2,1,"I usually love this app, but I can't find most of the music that I've paid for and supposedly download. I'd like to set a certain song as a ringtone and went looking. It turns out I'm missing probably 95% of the music in my library, whether I've paid for the albums individually or with music unlimited. That is bs."
10935,AmazonMusic,A Google user,2,0,"You can expect to have to uninstall and reinstall the app with any system update on your phone... losing any locally stored play lists and such. :( I like that it doesn't interrupt music for ads, at least not for Prime members. It would be nice to have the option to take a break from songs without giving them a thumbs down. A ""tired of this song"" option would be nice, so you aren't hearing the same 20 or so songs over and over again."
10936,AmazonMusic,Justin Seay,1,9,"The app is great when it works. Which isn't often. If I try to add songs, play another song in a playlist or do anything, chances are that it won't happen. Click on a song? It will show that it got clicked but won't play. Downloading one song takes minutes. There is random skipping/buffering in the middle of downloaded songs - going for the CD experience I see. It's ridiculous that 100 bucks a year gets us this, and its even worse for anyone who pays $8 per month for unlimited."
10937,AmazonMusic,M BLG,3,0,"Over all great. One issue I'm having is that albums that I have listened to have their tracklist out of order. Say I listened to the last 4 tracks of an album. I go back to that album, those 4 tracks now are at the top of the tracklist with no number showing what order they go in the tracklist. Sometimes I've listened to entire albums and only certain songs do this. It's really annoying since I like to listen to albums straight through. Clearing app data/cache or uninstalling doesn't fix it"
10938,AmazonMusic,Kaushik Mane,2,0,"Not all albums are available! When i receive a call and if i have to disconnect my earphones to attend it. Post call, the songs just play out loud, disturbing others, other apps do not have this issue and the songs will resume only after we put the earphones back on. kindly fix this bug. Also provide suggestions and playlists can definitely be better."
10939,AmazonMusic,richard dorfner,1,1,this app is just annoying. it's got crappy search features. reliably dues not find the album in my music library even if i select my music library it defaults to searching Amazon music store instead. takes a ton of time.. and the pc version is even worse. yeah. download the music and play it with something good like pi player. update. they updated the app!! and made it even shittier!! so down from two Stars to one. now i can no longer scroll the time slider to someplace new in the song. pos
10940,AmazonMusic,Saul Guajardo,3,1,"Disappointed at best. So most song purchases work after you download them. Some songs you purchase tend to not ever get downloaded. I have gone through troubleshooting myself with updating, force closing, and clearing the cache with no success. Suffering at the hands of customer service response groups and having the app freeze numerous times throughout every day. Why I bother with 3 stars is because the songs that download (sucessfully) work. Other than that its Pirate Bay for me."
10941,AmazonMusic,Sunny Wilson,5,3,"Great selection of free music. I mostly play Christian or soothing music for sleep, but also has great preschool music selection. there are no Ads except occasionally for Amazon Music's premium option, which is a little too easy to select without realizing, sp be careful there. All in all, very satisfied with this app."
10942,AmazonMusic,Jason Sutton,1,1,"would be a good source of music with my prime subscription but it continually asks if I want an unlimited trial which means it never autostarts when I'm giving a voice command, it just sits there waiting for me to decline yet another unlimited trial. Take the hint! Moved on to another platform now and I can't really justify the Prime membership anymore."
10943,AmazonMusic,Ben H,1,1,I have to download this app because Alexa purchased it without my consent. so because you can't cancel it nearly as easy as you can buy it. i have to go through this just to cancel my subscription. oh and i have turned off Alexa's ability to buy through voice
10944,AmazonMusic,Bobby Esquilin,4,9,great app easy to use sync with everything I have. great great price if your a prime member. sÃ³ I can play a song in my bedroom and If I have to go somewhere else around my home I could just send it ti the other room or play the song everywhere via echo devices. now a few BAD thing ( to me personally). they need to personalize it more for each customer (ie 1.recommend song based on what your account has listened to. 2. stop allowing the customer to download the same song if its download already
10945,AmazonMusic,Janet Parga,5,0,"Like all other music apps, without a premium subscription, it has it downfalls- Not all artist albums/songs are available to listen to, or to add to a playlist. Which sucks, because you're limited to the variation of songs from [X] artist; (ex:) if you're a fan of someone in particular, you're given 3 of 7 albums. I will, however, say that comparable to other apps: unlimited skips, picks songs at will, and Ad-FREE!"
10946,AmazonMusic,kenneth Gage,1,8,"it works good on my echo. But every time that I want to use it on my smartphone or use it using Bluetooth on my smartphone, it sucks. All it does is sit there and reboot and all it does is sit there and reconfigure my music. I have a super fast phone and I do not have this problem with any other app. So it's not that I have a slow phone or that it is some other extenuating circumstance. I'm just glad that it works with my Amazon Echo flawlessly."
10947,AmazonMusic,Martin Peake,1,0,"If you purchase music from Amazon and download it to your phone, it will delete it from your collection if you don't have the Amazon Music App . If you purchase music it should be yours to do what you wish with it, and not dependant on another Amazon product which you don't really need. The 'playlists' that dominate the app, are the usual Algorithm driven nonsense that demean normal human beings ."
10948,AmazonMusic,Leo Yuen,3,0,"I gave it 3 stars because it has a reasonable number of songs for the free limited access. However, I have also tried the unlimited access. It did not have as many songs as Google Music or Spotify. If I need to pay, I rather pay Spotify or Google because even I pay Amazon for unlimited Music, it won't give me the songs that I like to listen."
10949,AmazonMusic,Lewis W,2,32,"unstable and keeps resetting from playing the playlist to the front screen, Also annoying is songs keep getting removed or can only be played 'when online'. If playing offline because you don't want it to kick the arse out of your data allowance and said track comes up next to play, the system halts and trys to get you to turn on Internet connection, thus interrupting the play session. If it wasn't 'free' with prime I'd delete this crappy app."
10950,AmazonMusic,Aaron Mitchell,2,4,"This used to be a great app; When you opened it, the app went right to your playlists. Now, however, whenever I get into it advertisements pop up, and I have to click no, I don't want whatever your selling, before it takes my to a page selling their music. Very annoying."
10951,AmazonMusic,Jack Peverley,3,2,The app itself has been updated and works better since my last review but it's still very buggy with Android Auto. Selecting playlists on the screen does nothing which means I have to stop and change playlists on my phone. The app constantly crashes when skipping songs to fast too. I've tried it on 3 different cars fron different manufacturers and it's the same on all 3. Desperately needs fixing.
10952,AmazonMusic,Mark Chadwick,1,7,I pay for amazon music so I can listen on echo and through this app in my car via Bluetooth. I have found that when I listen to music in the car and my screen goes off the audio from this app slows and stutters making it unlistenable. If i wake the phone it's fine. No other app does this (have tried other music apps and podcast apps). If it carries on I will look at cancelling my subscription.
10953,AmazonMusic,A Google user,1,28,This app used to be good but recently the music skips or randomly doesn't play even with music you have downloaded. When searching for music it takes ages to load the album up and then crashes before it does. I won't be paying for unlimited after my trial definitely not worth Â£7.99 a month especially when I'm already paying for prime.
10954,AmazonMusic,Lochness321,2,9,i wish you wouldn't keep in deleting my songs! remove that kind of thing at once!! i had my most favorite song on there and you guys removed it!!! i can't even buy it either bc it's not on there!!! only YouTube!!! GET! IT! FIXED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AND STOP TAKING IT OUT OF MY MUSIC PLAYLIST LIKE A SCOOTERS COMANCHE!!!!!!
10955,AmazonMusic,A Google user,1,16,"Started off as a good thing; but now they're pestering relentlessly trying to get you to pay more, all the while taking away songs from your playlist(cause they're no longer included with prime) and have to pay extra to listen to it again. Not to mention random interruptions in the middle of the song for either lag or asking if you're still listening. 03/29/19: I'm growing to hate this app."
10956,AmazonMusic,Mariya Lomakina,5,1,"This is the only app I use to listen music. it works very well, search is convenient. the only problem I had was that recently I was on a plane and wanted to listen to my offline music and it was all disabled, saying something like it timed out. It would be nice at least to have a warning, when it's about to happen."
10957,AmazonMusic,Ashton Stresau,3,0,"I was a big fan for a long time until I discovered that some of the music that I purchased started becoming inaccessible due to Amazon losing rights to the music. I never recieve any notifications of when this happens OR a refund for the purchase, as far as I know... Also there are bugs in the app that prevent you from adding your music to playlists that you create from drop down menus. Tsk tsk, Amazon"
10958,AmazonMusic,Ken Dandridge,3,0,"great music selection.. the app sucks tho. I can't really put my finger on what is wrong with it. But I've used almost every other streaming service and they cost a bit more considering the good deal you get with Amazon, but their app/interface is way better. The only specific example i can think of is how music never stops on other apps.. You search a song on Amazon and the music is done after one song.."
10959,AmazonMusic,babyshaun82,4,0,"I like the Amazon Music Unlimited App a lot because they do have a wide variety of music by different artists(unlike some music apps that don't....I won't name any namesðŸ¤¨ðŸ™„ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜). However, what I don't like is the fact that the albums & the cds r not listed in an accurate timeline order(I don't like having to skim & hunt for their cds that r not in chronological order, imo/js) & also that they don't have EVERY album/CD from certain artists either. Once again, that's my gripe, imo/js."
10960,AmazonMusic,Eric Angeles,3,0,"The good: It runs above other apps and keeps playing music when minimized. The free playlists and stations are decent. Lyrics if available can be shown too. Access to your purchased library is seamless. The bad: Purchasing music is not easy. You actually have to click browse, then search, then some store options come up. It's also buggy. Try browsing new releases, then select a genre like r and b, then select songs. After that screen loads, rotate the orientation of your phone. It reverts back"
10961,AmazonMusic,Erika Narane,5,0,"great app, it freezes a bit when in the computer working with heavy design software, but works well when on my mobile. extensive music database on christian songs (rock, worship, hymns, gospel, instrumental). I was quite shocked in a positive way. I'm sure there is plenty towards other genres but I can only say about what I'm into. yes I recommend it specially because with prime you still get access to free audio books, kindle books and delivery on Amazon.this I didn't realise for long time"
10962,AmazonMusic,Vehaan Handa,4,0,"In one word: good. In a few sentences, it has an edge over Saavn because you can download music even without a paid account, a really huge plus point which I hope is continued. However, a select few songs are not available on it, so I would highly recommend Amazon to expand its library. Overall, very good."
10963,AmazonMusic,A Google user,2,2,"pros: easy to use app, easy to search and easy to store your preferred songs. cons: Very limited selection of songs in musical genres. I don't appreciate paying for a subscription to Amazon prime only to find out you must pay for any additional subscription to have unlimited access to ALL songs."
10964,AmazonMusic,James Wignall,2,1,"I already pay for prime, now you want and additional 14.00$ for unlimited music. google play I can put multiple devices on and unlimited music for 10 dollar, and you want another 3.99 for Alexa music. Boy oh boy, suck all you can out of us. I told my wife there would be additional cost to just using amazon, I was right."
10965,AmazonMusic,Clint Martin,3,1,"I really like the app, but it will freeze, pause, buffer, whatever... all the time in the middle of a song. Even when connected to WiFi it still has ""buffering"" issues. I would give a 5 star review if this is fixed. I'd love to listen to music without it cutting out in the middle of songs."
10966,AmazonMusic,Ben Whitlock,3,1,"The service included with Prime is excellent, but increasingly albums I used to listen to address being moved to the additional subscription service. This is disappointing - if something is on the service, it shouldn't keep getting moved to get me to pay - is prefer to use a specialist service by someone else."
10967,AmazonMusic,Steve Gledhill,5,1,"While there is still music I cannot access with my unlimited package (content that is accessible on Spotify), I have left my CD catalog in the trunk of my car for months as I listen to Amazon Music. The sound quality is better turned up at louder volume than Pandora. I cancelled unlimited Pandora in favor of Amazon Music. I have created playlists with more than 1000 tunes each. Never predictable, even though certain track #s often repeat at separate listenings. I do love my Amazon Music."
10968,AmazonMusic,Duncan MacPhail,5,19,"It's all I need. Events, parties or casual listening, it's been used for all of the above and more! There hasn't been an artist or a specific song that I haven't been able to find. I'm very, very pleased. (I even found an abundance of ""old radio shows"" from the days where radio was strictly ""skit"" based!"") I was blown away! I'm 47 years old and music is my life. Thanks for contributing to my days! Well done! Duncan MacPhail"
10969,AmazonMusic,Irfan Abbasi,2,1,"Pros: Free with Amazon Prime Cons: - Keeps crashing regularly on my OnePlus 5 - At times, if you play a song, it won't play the next one automatically. Then you'll go to the app only to see it's not responding anymore. - They keep dropping songs very frequently. And has a poor collection relatively - There are duplicates of the same song - Simgle album is broken in two albums (e.g. Gully Boy) - All downloads get deleted if you uninstall and then install it again. Plus, no 'Download All' option"
10970,AmazonMusic,David Ridings,4,2,Would be 5 stars of it didn't crash every so often. Update - Has worked fantastic since the last couple of updates they have put out. I would recommend this to anybody that has an Amazon music subscription and also the echo dots or any echo products for that matter. If you have any problems connecting your echoes or making them work in the Amazon Music app the problem isn't the Amazon music app the problem is in the Amazon Alexa app which is kind of flaky.
10971,AmazonMusic,Suzanne Shipp,4,1,I love all the music options.The only reason I rated it 4 instead of 5 stars is because I am forced to answer the upgrade message everytime I open the app. If i want to join I will go back and join. Forcing me to choose every single time is excessive. I have other options for music for this very reason.
10972,AmazonMusic,A Google user,4,1,"Most (like 95%) of the music I buy is vinyl. I have a hard time paying money for digital. If I buy a vinyl record from Amazon, I get a digital copy available to play in their app. I appreciate that, and the app functions as one would hope. I dont use many of its features, admittedly."
10973,AmazonMusic,A Google user,4,3,I've been an Amazon Music subscriber for years! I enjoy the vast amount of music in their Library! More than I've found on others which i have to use at work! The only glitch i have is my Membership sometimes I'm a exclusive member and other times I'll lose my library of songs??? But I stick with Amazon!!!
10974,AmazonMusic,David Menchaca,1,1,Prompts you to go unlimited at every turning point. There are too many road blocks to purchasing music and getting to sample before you buy. They need to make it easier to navigate and not making the unlimited option the first even sometimes only option every time. Switching to iTunes finally and not using this platform anymore.
10975,AmazonMusic,Brent Adcox,4,1,"This music app could be the best, but they take away songs that are on your playlist for some reason! Stop doing that and Amazon will he the best music app....eva!!! Make it happen! Im staying with ya to see you do it!! Let's go!! It's time to make it happen!! Be the best!"
10976,AmazonMusic,Rick Aberle,5,5,finally free of commercials and unexpected pauses. I listen to old music so no need to pay $100 plus a year for music service. Beware Amazon and a few other companies have compelling value that will be chosen by many of us... capitalism at work... great value to savers ($$) like me.
10977,AmazonMusic,Sierra wysocky,5,16,"I love this app! I just drove cross country in a moving truck, the radio stations were few but Amazon music allows me to download a playlist so even though I wasn't in my truck with my satellite radio I had all my favorite music! and don't even get me started on the great stations tailored to my favorite artists, you can skip ahead or go back as many songs as you want! it's perfect for hooking up to your favorite speaker, Alexa or earbuds and getting stuff done around the house/yard or parties!"
10978,AmazonMusic,Brandon Barclay,3,0,"Before amazon unlimited became a thing, I was going to give it 4 stars, for having a decent backlog of music. It wasn't nor is on spotify levels of selection but my tastes are usually satisfied with the selection that is there. They decided, however, that they wanted to charge extra for a music subscription ontop of the prime subscription, which used to be the only way to actually access amazon music."
10979,AmazonMusic,Abhishek Nag,3,0,"Why does my phone think this app needs to put to sleep and using too much battery? Sometimes it stops it when screen is turned off, which stops the music playing. Unlocking the phone resumes music. Not facing this problem with PlayerPro or Spotify. Fix it? PS. I have explicitly excluded Amazon Music from the list of apps that need to put to sleep. (Which is not recommended.)"
10980,AmazonMusic,Mark Murphy,3,0,"When it works properly I love it. However, the soundtracks and albums can randomly change their order entirely, which gets extremely annoying when you want to listen to a soundtrack in order. I have emailed about this issue twice and tried deleting and reinstalling the app, but it doesn't get fixed. Be aware."
10981,AmazonMusic,Yaya Lala,4,0,"I would love to know how to open this music from my internal storage. I was under the impression that if I downloaded a song that the song would go to internal storage of the phone so that I can listen to it offline...... but when I select to download a song it does not show the audio file in the storage of the phone ... the song is only available in the Amazon app...... other than that everything else is good, great options"
10982,AmazonMusic,J White,2,0,"Napster and Rhapsody are both much better than Amazon Music. Amazon ""stations"" appear to just be playlists and not a changing mix of songs and artists each time you listen to a station. Rhapsody ""chanels"" were constantly changing songs. Amazon Music resets itself after I've been listening to it thru Bluetooth in my car, then leave the car for more than a few hours (like going to work). I have to restart the app and find my music again. Rhapsody and Napster automatically pick right back up."
10983,AmazonMusic,Stefanie Lewis,5,0,"My favorite music app. I've been an Amazon customer for about 15 yrs, and I've had very few issues with anything associated with the company (Prime, Kindle, Audible, etc). the Prime music app is no different. I love having access to all the music I've purchased on the site, and it's easy to use online or offline."
10984,AmazonMusic,Matthew Salerno,1,1,"I was a PAYING PRIME Member for years and thru my yearly payments used my MEMBERSHIP to download music at the time before ""Amzon Music"" splintered off. I had Paid fee's for years& aquired a large library. When the ""Terms of Service"" changed the music I RIGHTFULLY OWNED was blocked from my access unless I Paid 9.99 extra a month. Amazon did nothing.My Amazon account was comprimised later, there is no fraud department& account security is a joke,all I provided was my address to gain account access"
10985,AmazonMusic,Devin West,2,0,"Definitely not as pretty or smooth as Spotify. no podcasts. sometimes you will get stuck on a page and not be able to go back to the Music home screen. whenever you go to an artist's page it's not always easy to find a list of albums, but sometimes it is?? there are just a lot of bugs and glitches and Amazon doesn't seem to fix them."
10986,AmazonMusic,Deleah Jones,5,4,"used to have xm, but the prices kept going up. though i loved my xm i had to make a change. i am so glad i did. I absolutely love the amazon music app. i cant believe i paid what i did for xm when amazon music has been here as an option. so glad i made the switch. definitely worth it."
10987,AmazonMusic,Damian Renovato,5,3,So far every song I look for is in here. Amazon music would separate from the rest if they added a karaoke feature where it would highlight lyrics on karaoke songs (english and spanish) like they do on the original versions of songs. Or does it do that already and I don't know about it?
10988,AmazonMusic,Mister M,2,1,"was a proud prime member, telling everyone the benefits and growth of prime video and amazon music. Now that they got a catalogue theyve raised the price of prime, and taken away music unless you pay for amazon unlimited, I feel betrayed. I feel theyve turnt on their loyal customers trying to make a quick buck, prime is no longer worth it, you're paying 100 a year for a mediocre at best version of Netflix, if you know what you want to hear amazon music is unusable. GET RID OF AMAZON UNLIMITED"
10989,AmazonMusic,Under Ground Sounds,3,2,"Switched from Google Play Music to Amazon Music since I have prime. So far I can say I really enjoy the app. I like that albums actually fit my screen and have lyrics opposed to Play Music. One complain, I don't like how you cant see which song played before or that their isn't a queue like Play Music does. All in all happy with the switch especially since I can cast it to my subpair unlike in Play Music."
10990,AmazonMusic,Jessie Richthofen,5,17,"I don't have a very good phone & it's a little old &really beat up. I don't even own a separate speaker other than the one on my phone. I've been going through some really tough time in my life and I have so many medical issues now that stop me from living a normal life! I just recently started doing the Amazon Music thing & I truly believe that if I didn't have Amazon Music, I would lose my freakin mind! So, thanks Amazon! You rock!! Hails and Horns\,,/ðŸ\,,/"
10991,AmazonMusic,Nihal Hebbar,2,40,"Decent in terms of the collection of Music would be great if you would have entire discographies instead of just having one album for certain artists. Also, every time i try browsing via Wi-Fi it displays unavailable currently then it starts working over cellular data.. haven't been able to find a solution for this, hope AMM fixes this issue"
10992,AmazonMusic,Latifa Newbill,3,5,"while i love the app, the glitches make it hard for me to give it 5 stars. the control buttons spontaneously freeze when on locked screen and i have to unlock the phone to change songs. when using hands free with alexa it's is not very hands free seeing that many times alexa does not respond until i skip a song manually first, here lately she has begun popping up without being prompted during songs, causing significant portions of the song to be skipped. it is annoying."
10993,AmazonMusic,j Amado,4,2,"It's good for the most part but then one may add a song to a playlist and then find that it has been blocked and available for purchase only. One can't help but feel disappointed, border line cheated at times when you consider that we pay a handsome monthly ransom for their service. Otherwise I'm Okay with it."
10994,AmazonMusic,Eddie Munoz,3,1,"i like the program to access my purchased music, but it is pretty obvious it geared towards getting people to subscribe to its music service. Everytime i use the app im having to click out of ads asking if id like to subscribe to amazon music... or navigate a broswer page of music i can purcahse or access if i have a subscription. I don't care i only want to listen to the music i purchased in a simple and easy manner without being hounded."
10995,AmazonMusic,Jan Schnee,3,1,lots of bugs when playing music or trying to download bought songs. Especially when it was accidentally put in the library in advance because it's prime. Ends up in a total mess. Otherwise the player doesn't offer any built in equalizer and doesn't work with the one installed. Not good overall.
10996,AmazonMusic,Gwampa Camacho,2,0,"Nice selection but some silly bugs can make the app a pain to use. Sometimes ill click on a new song or album just and instead of playing the song i wanted it just continues playing the current song. Also some albums will suddenly have the songs out of order and there is no option to sort the music aside from downloading, creating a playlist, and then entering the songs in the correct order. A lot of extra steps just to enjoy music. A few embarrasing bugs from a company with tons of resources."
10997,AmazonMusic,Jeff Curths,3,7,"The Amazon music app is great when it works. I often find that the app will not play a song from an artist station. I can play the same song if I search for it and just choose the song, but it won't play on the artist station/'radio'. The app also has problems playing songs that I have downloaded from a playlist. This happens if I'm trying to listen to an entire album. When the playlist reaches a song that I have downloaded, it tells me that it can't stream the song."
10998,AmazonMusic,Spencer Gallucci,3,0,"It has a good selection of music, I am just annoyed they removed the feature of adding your own music. I used to have my iTunes, personal recordings and Amazon music all in one place and now it is separated which is really annoying. Aside from that it is a good app, sometimes it takes a while to load but that probably has more to do with internet connection than the app itself."
10999,AmazonMusic,Gabbinzola,2,10,"Only use this music app because it comes with Amazon Prime. The app randomly shuts down on me, when I go to ""play next"" for a song it will restart the one I'm listening to, it frequently refuses to download songs and play lists, and lags often. Also, when I'm in online mode I can't access my offline play lists, which is a pain. If the app would be so much smoother and easier to use I would probably buy the Unlimited option, but I'm not gonna buy it when Google Play is just a few dollars more."
11000,AmazonMusic,Deanna Rossini,2,0,"I have had this app for many years and loved what free music I could get as a prime member. However, I am so disappointed that Amazon now wants more money to listen to most of these songs. It's bad enough that the prime membership has gone up AND now they want more money to listen to the music that used to be free. I am thinking about dropping this app all together."
11001,AmazonMusic,Brad Cwell,4,0,"It is a good service and has a lot of features. Only some mild difficulties interfacing with Android phones on the app and doesn't track music I add to ""my music"" from the Alexa device, but at least it works. Great for downloads. I still prefer the functionality of Google play music though, but this service is comperable."
11002,AmazonMusic,Aaron Villa,1,1,being asked every time you open (i am already a prime member) if i want to spend more money is getting super obnoxious. i spend over $100 a year already and you wamt me to spend more? please stop asking. mayne once a month or every few months BUT NOT EVERY TIME I OPEM YOUR APP.
11003,AmazonMusic,Richard Velez,2,0,"Stop stealing my purchased music!!!!! I have been buying cd's with autorip for a decade. The cd's that were purchased years ago with Autorip have only a few songs per cd (if I'm lucky) or are completely inaccessible. I PAID for both the cd and autorip. If I were Amazon, I would research the purchased history and restore my digital files before you get your ass sued!!!!"
11004,AmazonMusic,Matthew Albarracin,3,1,"It's alright. My biggest issue would be how much they advertise for Unlimited. I already pay for Amazon Prime. That's already a lot of money a year, so for them to keep advertising to give them even more money is a pretty big slap to the face."
11005,AmazonMusic,Ken Moore,1,3,"you buy a song or even an album and 2, 3 months later Amazon removes it from your list and or library and you can no longer have it. I can count ruffle 25, 30 songs I can no longer play,,,,,, hummmm at $1.99 or $1.49 a song you for the most part rented that a good profit for them"
11006,AmazonMusic,A Google user,1,1,I have a Prime membership and I continually feel very pressured by the tactics within this app that keep trying to get me to purchase yet another 'unlimited' plan. Poor experience. i would like to see an option where Prime users can only see songs they are allowed to listen to via their existing subscription.
11007,AmazonMusic,Bob Kitch,5,1,"With Amazon unlimited I can look up almost any band...even some local ones that I wouldn't expect to see. Works well never hangs up or goes into buffering. The download songs or lists allows me to have music when im out hiking or traveling where there is no signal and also saves on carrier data charges, 128 gig micro SD cards are inexpensive and hold lots of music. Only thing i wish for is an equalizer!"
11008,AmazonMusic,walter alter,1,13,"starts off pretty good able to download and listen offline, but after not using it for a few days came back to it to not be able to listen to songs I downloaded. unless you buy the ""unlimited music"" which is not included in Amazon prime. disappointed really .."
11009,AmazonMusic,devin kolditz,3,1,Overall it's a good app. I was just annoyed with songs not being able to play. I would certain songs and then the next day the song is not available. I think spotify at first is a little confusing but it's worth getting used to it with all of the free stuff you get with it and not having to not be able to play certain songs.
11010,AmazonMusic,Toky Deere,3,5,"So far half decent, comparable to others, but with one really annoying thing. When clearing other apps in the background, if you clear all or accidentally this app, the music will turn off completely and you'll have to open the app again and start the music again. Would be nice if music played after clearing in the recent apps like other music streaming apps do."
11011,AmazonMusic,John Engels,4,0,"It is a good app but not perfect. Some albums have the same songs 2 or even 3 times listed so while you want to listen to an album you might hear the same song over and over again before the next track. Also if songs are not available anymore in your music and you want to delete the album, if there are more than 2 or 3 of the same songs listed it might one delete the 10 out of 20 songs. Then you will have to go in and delete each of the 10 songs one at a time which becomes time consuming."
11012,AmazonMusic,Ian Mackie,1,12,"Used to be ok, but not now. If i downloaded music it plays fine at first. However, if i switch the phone off, after i switch it back on and try to play the downloaded music it says ""music unavailable"". I need to ""remove from my device"" and then play it online or download it again. Get this bug fixed!"
11013,AmazonMusic,Rama Krishnan,1,2,"Stops playing if any other app plays audio, but doesn't resume after the other app is done with the audio. I have to get into this stupid music player for it to resume playing. I might as well sing the song myself instead."
11014,AmazonMusic,Master Baiter,1,3,"This app is a joke. I bought a lot of music through this app, and when I play my DOWNLOADED music, it stops every few seconds, stutters, and NEVER able to finish a single song without stuttering, which is very annoying especially when playing via Bluetooth in the car. These things never happen with Google Music, it plays my music FLAWLESSLY. What a shame that a multi-billion company could not get their act straight with their apps."
11015,AmazonMusic,Jessica Bott,2,1,"Paid for the subscription. Loved it until Sam Smith's new album wouldn't play at all, and a good amount of songs that are brand new only play halfway through. Contacted them and they said it was a glitch. It was never fixed so I cancelled and switched to Spotify because it's cheaper anyways."
11016,AmazonMusic,Caesar Gochi,1,3,horrible experience with thus app. DO NOT DOWNLOAD. if you tap on a song to play it will take more than 1/2 of the current song to actually start playing. Even on wifi (150mbs) it is extremely slow. As I am writting this it pops up as if it's going to play with an all grey screen. HORRIBLE HORRIBLE
11017,AmazonMusic,Air Jewel,1,10,"I hate Amazon music. I'm not impressed. Amazon recently removed music that was in my library. Very limited music selection unless you pay more. It's dissapointing and frustrating. The app is slow to boot up and crashes a lot. It's very unreliable. I have free radio apps that work better than Amazon music. Amazon needs to get it together, there is really no excuse for how poor this app is."
11018,AmazonMusic,Jessica Yoder,4,2,"App is fine as a music player. Playlists can't be alphabetized unless you drag and drop the songs yourself, which is difficult if the list is more than one screen long. Alexa is not easy to use. It's hard to buy music through the app, it's constantly pushing you to join unlimited."
11019,AmazonMusic,Eli Beck,2,28,"I used to love this, but the selection just isn't catching up with all the new music out there.  Enough good songs are exclusive to Unlimited that it isn't worth it anymore. The player isn't great either; sometimes my downloaded songs won't play in the car and I have to restart the app. I'm moving on"
11020,AmazonMusic,A Google user,4,1,"Mostly great, but sometimes it forces me to unlock my phone to skip, pause, or rate a song instead of allowing me to do it from the lock screen. I also wish more music was available to regular Prime listeners instead of trying to get me to subscribe to Unlimited but that's not really the app's fault"
11021,AmazonMusic,Shreyans Jasoriya,1,1,"Recent updates have introduced some bugs. The song being played does not get updated in the notification panel. Sometimes, the play button is visible instead of pause in notification panel. Additionally, the songs continuously lag with Bluetooth headphones."
11022,AmazonMusic,Adrian Mayer,1,0,"App works... Well at least some times, when the internet connection is fast enough or better said when the app decides it's fast enough. But the worst thing is the crazy bad user interface, when you sort your music by artist and want an album view or add a whole album to a Playlist you're lost. Playback quality is quite good."
11023,AmazonMusic,Charles Riegel,1,2,"Has recently become unusable. I'm not sure what happened, but it used to work just fine, but now it stutters and skips to the point where the music is unlistenable. This is both through my car stereo and my portable bluetooth speaker."
11024,AmazonMusic,David Spurrier,3,0,"It's fine. Plays the songs I get for ""free"" with my monthly Amazon Prime payment. Annoyed that those songs constantly change... so don't bother building lists. They'll ""lose"" songs as time goes by and different songs come and go. I'm not gonna bother paying more for Unlimited. Amazon already gets enough of my money."
11025,AmazonMusic,Travis Zander,3,0,"Happy with the quantity of music but volume levels seems to fluctuate, even with downloaded music. As of the latest update, I lost the playback buttons on the lock screen and notification pull down. It's pretty inconvenient to have to go into the app in order to access the controls. I hope this gets fixed soon. Oneplus 6T"
11026,AmazonMusic,Melissa Huff,2,0,"Could use more music options without paying additional money! The selection is the worst of any app for music, despite being a prime member and supposedly getting a good selection. Selection gets better if I want to pay additional money per month which is ridiculous to be honest. Also has troubles when multiple devices are in use. Thinking of just paying the additional for iTunes and calling it a day"
11027,AmazonMusic,Lee Ann Mizell,1,0,"used to love this app even though there's a monthly service fee. lately, however, alot of my songs on my playlist have been deleted or are no longer available. also, when playing some of the Amazon playlists a lot of songs won't stream. what's the deal, Amazon?? think I'm going to check out Pandora... aggravating"
11028,AmazonMusic,A Google user,3,1,"ok as does what a streaming platform should. sometimes when you search an artist it may not show up unless you find them on a feature somewhere else then have to click on their profile from there, also newest releases aren't always at the top & app can restart or stop on its own for no reason. also quite a bit of music not available here then what i have had on other streaming platforms"
11029,AmazonMusic,Lisa Apotheker,3,2,"I use this app because we have prime. I certainly wouldn't pay extra for it. I expected an Amazon product to be more user friendly but I have trouble navigating it. There are probably features I'm not using because I don't want to take the time to learn how. A lot of the time if I want to hear a particular song, I just Youtube it."
11030,AmazonMusic,Deepanjan Sengupta,5,31,"A lot of songs are not available which are easily available on YouTube, Apple Music, etc. Overall I like the app because it allows you to use other apps while the music plays at the background. And the best part is that you can sync it with Alexa. Overall a great experience."
11031,AmazonMusic,Colin Robertson,1,1,"technically it does everything it is supposed to, bit this app is missing the intuitive, more-than-expected feel of Amazon. It's polished but very poor text color choices (grey on darker grey) make navigation difficult in daylight. UI architecture is inconsistent with itself. ""Downloaded"" music requires a constant internet connection."
11032,AmazonMusic,K Thompson,1,12,"on march 15th 2016, the update for this erased all the music i had downloaded to my phone as a unlimited music subscriber. talking to customer service, i learned that this update caused it to unregister and reregister my device, erasing all of my downloaded licenses and they cuouldnt even provide me with a list of songs for a template for me to re download them. just glad this happened a week before my 99 cent 3 month trial was up..."
11033,AmazonMusic,Jeff Oler,3,0,"OK. Numerous issues. Difficult to simply locate your own playlists and manage online and offline playlists. There appears to be no sync feature. Albums seem to lose songs out of them upon repeat searches. Sometimes there are numerous versions of the same album and the app gets confused, eventually showing numerous repeats of the same song within an album. Songs frequently disappear or become unplayable. Difference between playlist and queued is frequently not clear."
11034,AmazonMusic,MISTER ROWENTREE,4,0,"Lots of content - hard to find ""free to standard prime"" only content. Asked too many times a day if I want to try Premium - already seeing/hearing commercials to remind me I don't have it. Honestly searching for 'any' content like ""karaoke"" or ""sixties music"" turns up more false positives than useful content.... and more keywords just confuses the search engine. There also doesn't seem to be a good ""your type of music"" algorithm for Auto Play - when you just want your website to pick 4 U!"
11035,AmazonMusic,Elley Nelly,3,0,"I am disappointed that the ""filter"" of explicit content isn't better. Also I am disappointed the thumbs down isn't more accurate. The same disliked song crops up again and again. Our family uses this app but now we only use it for a few playlists we came up with. For this feature we love it!"
11036,AmazonMusic,Neil Pickles,3,0,Music streaming great and the download option is brilliant especially if you are flying. However the new UI is terrible as I can't find new releases and filter by the genres I like (which you used to be able to do). The recommended options is always albums I have in my music especially when trying to find new music.
11037,AmazonMusic,Gonzalo Battaglia,3,1,Works well and gives you easy access to a lot of music IF you have prime. And it keeps trying to sell me amazon music unlimited. it's very annoying when you make a playlist and songs start disappearing. So the app works well but if I didn't have prime I certainly wouldn't use it.
11038,AmazonMusic,Henry Vargas,1,10,"Amazon can't keep up with this app, a lot of glitches and bugs, I'm fed up but have thousands of song with Amazon and I regret that. UPDATE 10/28/18: app is still freezing, even after deleting and reinstalling, b.s. app. Update 11/2/18 deleted, downloaded again, still not working. Samsung Galaxy S8. UPDATE 2/11/2019 amazon music app is still not working as it should, worse than ever, on 3 different Galaxy S8's, household wifi is about as good as it gets, FAST, no excuses Amazon/Jeff Bezos."
11039,AmazonMusic,Saumya Bhatia,2,14,"the music collection isnt too bad but the interface is horrible! why cant i choose one song and make a queue but rather have to listen to the entire music collection. then rearranging songs in the queue is sooo difficult; it just wont scroll up beyond one page. along with that if i wish to add a song from one oreset playlist, it will clear my current queue and add that entire playlist as the queue while i JUST want one song from that playlist. horrible interface."
11040,AmazonMusic,Gigi Schuster,1,1,"I am paying for your Amazon Prime, I have two Echo dots and your FireStick, now your telling me $4 a month won't allow me to play on all devices. Now can't select any of my Amazon Prime Music on my cell without upgrading and paying $8 bucks and you donâ€™t have enough of my music worth paying that, that I already have saved and paid for elsewhere this is absolutely abuse of your Music Plan Service AMAZON. Also other apps for same$$have actually Only1Song Repeat, yet yours can't compete with basic"
11041,AmazonMusic,Adam Bond,3,1,It's OK. Tidal and even Spotify are better than Amazon. I will say they do seem to have more songs than Tidal but the interface is bad. I want to see the artists i'm following not the ones in my playlists. I get it free through a family plan and still prefer to pay for Tidal.
11042,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,9,I have truly enjoyed having Amazon Music. I buy most of my music from Amazon and have for many years and this has been an excellent compliment to my buying experience. I am able to make playlists that I play through my phone and I'm looking forward to learning how to use the Alexa voice activation. I'm in my late 60's so you young folks should have no trouble with this app.
11043,AmazonMusic,pavit bhutani,2,0,"The app keeps crashing every now and then and a playlist just stops playing on its own, as if the app got restarted. It sometimes stops playing if I switch to the next song 4-5 times continuously while playing a playlist with shuffle on. No native equalizer option in the app which is a big no! Trying to download or play songs online sometimes takes forever. I'm just using it for the content."
11044,AmazonMusic,Killa Cali Hustle,4,0,great app even though I think its dumb and a rip off to charge me when I have prime just for access to a small number of albums that I like to listen to.. Also there should be an easier way to remove music from your library other than one song/album/or artist at a time. I should be able to long press and mark (x. amount) of what I want to remove. same could be said to making playlists etc
11045,AmazonMusic,Pankaj Vashist,4,0,A good app just like other Amazon products. Nice collection of songs and good play lists and stations. I like them and mostly go with recommendations. But sometimes it feels like streaming a YouTube video. Like a little momentarily drop in signal will leave me with no sound which has confused me many times while driving. Like I thought Bluetooth has issues and all finally found out it was signal drop. But audio is way lighter than video so its should buffer quickly. Rest is all good.
11046,AmazonMusic,Stereoscopic SBS 3D Let'sPlays,4,0,"Most music I listen to is included with prime. Some music I listen to suddenly says no longer included with prime and asks that I pay for music unlimited (coincidence?). Also, music stops playing even when I am skipping songs with another device via bluetooth. The app seems to think I am no longer listening, this is very annoying."
11047,AmazonMusic,A Google user,4,0,"This app is great except for the fact that I can no longer upload my music to it. And some of the music I had purchased through Amazon disappeared at the same time they cancelled that option. Now, I have to use another app for my music as well. However, the app is stable and consistent and has a wide variety of music available. And that's just the basic version that comes with Prime. It's worth the money just for that."
11048,AmazonMusic,Amanda Kinnamon,3,0,"The only thing I dislike about Amazon music is that you lose your downloads if the song/artist is no longer in contract with Amazon. I'm assuming that's the reasoning behind it. If I download a song with a paid subscription, it should be mine. Period. I'm a huge fan of all things Amazon but this issue is just not cool."
11049,AmazonMusic,Jake Manning,4,0,"Great most of the time. The app still has quite a few bugs for how long its been out. That being said I still believe this is the best platform for music currently. Especially if you have Amazon Prime. If you are a Prime member there are a ton of free songs you can download to your device, or just stream for free."
11050,AmazonMusic,Strahl Tiger,2,1,"You asked me to rate it, so here we go. Decent platform, but will constantly bug you about amazon unlimited. Almost every time you open it, it pops up. I said no 60+ times already, but Amazon thinks if they relentlessly annoy me, I might change my mind."
11051,AmazonMusic,Michael Duncan,5,15,"This app provides solid music streaming and downloads. It shows me new music that I actually would like to listen to and, of course, it works with Alexa. They have also began acquiring new releases on the day they are released, so there is no delay in listening to your favorite artist's new songs."
11052,AmazonMusic,Sagar Bapardekar,4,5,Music player controls are not working when tried to change song from the notification pane. This issue is very rare. Don't know whether it's a mobile network issue or phone. I'm using one plus 6. pls look into this. Amazon prime music is one of favourite music Player so far...
11053,AmazonMusic,Coleen Workinger,5,2,love this app. I have premium. with lyrics. but needs more artist with ALL their albums. I have to jump back and forth from another app to hear all of gunplays albums and Montana of 300. no 2 carry all albums. that's just a tiny example. other than that I love it.
11054,AmazonMusic,Reza Ahmadkhani,3,1,most of the songs are not accessible in basic membership. Also $10 monthly just for songs in your ultimate prime music is just too high!! but overal the prime musiz app is well made and work nicely and smoothly. happy to have it in my prime membership as i dont shop very often on amazon or watch their prime videos at all! I am literally paying $10 just for basic limited prime music app!!
11055,AmazonMusic,Aaron Kolkovich,2,1,"unfortunately ive used this app for some months. switched from spotify because of being a prime member lots of songs were unlocked. unfortunately most the songs i listened to were not. so i oppted to pay for unlimited even though some songs are not litsted and i cannot find and now even worst they are removing music i listen to everyday ""no longer available"". to put the icing on the cake the app is always acting up so i think its about time i part ways."
11056,AmazonMusic,Daniel Schepis,1,1,"this was a wonderful app until they added the plus feature. now if you dont pay extra for ""free"" music and prefer to buy your songs its extremely difficult. i genuinely regret buying all the songs i did becsuse they have made it almost impossible to biy new songs and add it to library. all to often i had to buy the music from the amazon store app instead of here. (the songs purchased on the store can play on the app) but then even purchased songs wouldnt download because its protected ."
11057,AmazonMusic,Thomas Gervich,4,0,"It's awesome! the only thing keeping it from 5 stars is every once in a while whole albums that I have added to ""My Music"" disappear. I guess Amazon no longer offers it?? That really really sucks. perhaps a warning or something saying, ""Hey! might want to download this album if you want to keep it listening to it."" So, Amazon, not sure why you lose albums, surely it isn't the money or storage, but fix that."
11058,AmazonMusic,The Wild Gourmet,3,14,"I have prime unlimited and simply this is way to glitchy for a 5 star review. interface looks very dated, randomly just closes down, even on a good WIFI connection can take to long to buffer. Another really annoying thing is when a song becomes unavalible and is on one of your playlists it just stops playing at that point. Im a huge fan of Amazon tech but this is a real let down and in such a cut throat market they need to raise their game or face losing subscribers to competitors."
11059,AmazonMusic,Robin eb,4,0,"reception is very clear and not interrupted , even in parking garages and hospitals able to change play list quickly by scrolling till you come across your preference-no waiting for search or reconnect. also, no advertising and you can actually.go back to previous selections, using your car buttons. no need to use the phone at all once it starts. also can see the lyrics, but you do have to.make sure its connected to wi-fi before driving( this may depend on make and year of your car)"
11060,AmazonMusic,Jason Tricarico,3,13,"Worth a subscription but far from perfect, I hate that songs get ""removed"" and are unplayable, a quick search and the songs are still available. So they just appear to get moved in the database?...an auto fix would be nice. I also feel like stations play the exact same songs when I go back to them, seems more like playlists than a station..."
11061,AmazonMusic,Ivan Henson,2,22,You never know from one day to the next whether a song is going to be available or not and it's incredibly annoying! They're constantly taking away songs and music and you never know if/ when it'll come back. No other music service I've ever used has been this inconsistent.
11062,AmazonMusic,A Google user,2,0,After beafter being a YouTube music subescriber. I find this channel very disappointing I will probably be canceling my subscription. I was just thinking if rating Amazon music. And the funny thing is they asked me to rate it. Request made are never really right. Play list are not to my liking it doesn't know my style of music or preferences. (Youtube can) Also never gives me the songs that I asked for.I say this all around needs work. However I love my Alexa device.
11063,AmazonMusic,Dr. Vibe,4,3,My music library has been reassembled digitally thru Amazon Music online offline and CD wise. My vinyl collection got away from me so Amazon has been quite helpful. However there are some rarities that are not available thru Amazon which is why I give 4 stars instead of five.
11064,AmazonMusic,Nicole Vukadinova,5,0,"This is one of the best music providers ever - all music (including songs from different countries eg Bulgaria, it's the provider with the widest range) - the price for the subscription is not expensive (cheaper than others) - high quality music - it doesn't take a lot of space, even if you download the songs to listen offline - includes lyrics to songs"
11065,AmazonMusic,Alexandra Pruner,2,0,"You would think that with the billions of dollars Amazon makes per year they could design a music app that wasn't garbage. I don't know what algorithms they use to shuffle songs but it's useless. Music gets ""greyed out"" on your playlist and gets removed from Amazon's catalog so you can no longer listen to it. Glitches galore. Press to listen to a song, doesn't work. Press to add a song to a playlist, doesn't work. Constantly having to restart the app."
11066,AmazonMusic,Aryan Singh,3,0,"The app is good. Music quality is great but there are problems which can't be overlooked: 1(Critical). When a radio of a particular artist is started then the first song played is of the same singer but after that any random song comes up which is really annoying. 2. The user interface could get better. Apart from these, it is a good music app. Please get these fixed atleast the first one."
11067,AmazonMusic,Trenten Cunningham,5,0,"Been using this application for awhile and they're really great. I do take issue with how you have to pay to expand storage, but playing the devil's advocate, Amazon does give you perks not too different from how Spotify works that make it tolerable. I'd say if you are looking for an additional app to Sporify, or an alternative, Amazon Music would be your best bet. On a more personal not, the app allows you to accually purchase the music as well, so online or off you will always have access."
11068,AmazonMusic,Andrew,5,0,"I used Google Play Music for over 2 years and Amazon Music works a hell of a lot better than Google Play Music. It's just better in every way. GMP always took forever to play a song. with Amazon Music, the music starts right away. Only complaint: I can't listen to music while downloading a playlist. It completely messes up the song. Otherwise, that's it. I love the ""My Soundtrack"" station, playing what I love the most - Dio and Black Sabbath."
11069,AmazonMusic,Karol Kopiec,4,2,"I have been using Spotify previously and moved to Amazon Music since it is cheaper. I am very impressed by the app which in my opinion is much better than former. Would give 5 stars but ""Alexa set sleep timer for 1 hour"" despite giving verbal confirmation leaves timer unset."
11070,AmazonMusic,Vivek Trivedi,1,3,Worst Experience. 1. Most of the Famous regional songs are not unavailable. 2. Too much lag while opening the application. 3. Most of the Time it's not starting at all. 4. Application Crashes in between everytime. 5. The UI of the application is not upto the mark. 6. Overrated Application. 7. Alexa not listening to me.
11071,AmazonMusic,Tara Farm and Nursery Laurel Graham,5,0,Building A Business; Restoring My Spirit- I have been able to find and create play lists to support whatever task - or non-task- I am focused on. I can totally shift my mood to what I need by changing playlists. Building presentations or fences or working in the nursery with my beautiful plants. or finally letting it all go for awhile.
11072,AmazonMusic,Angelo Sanchez,5,0,The Amazon Music app for mobile devices is awesome. While on vacation in Jamaica my wife tried using Pandora and the country did not support the service. I immediately opened the Amazon Music app and started listening to my favorite music without any issues. I use it all the time. I love the app.
11073,AmazonMusic,AO AO,1,0,"I'm learning Spanish and I am disgusted that I pay $90 dollars a year, in addition to all of my other Amazon subscriptions for outdated music. I went to send my friend a song on YouTube and found out the song was from 2014. Use Spotify! Disgrace. New music? Just spit in my face next time. I'm calling for a refund, I will start over on Spotify with NEW MUSIC!"
11074,AmazonMusic,Venu P,1,3,"Still in Beta version I hope... Music customisation doesn't carry any meaning. Opted for only Telugu,still all nonsense is shown up. Who cares if some singh or sanu .... what ever the user opts as a paid member respect his options. And collection of Telugu songs is very limited. Hope Amazon will come out of all these weaknesses. Update: Still no improvement... Other players areway better"
11075,AmazonMusic,Melinda Scarbrough,4,1,"I've used this app for years now, and it is great. The only problem I have with it is that occasionally I download music that I have purchased to my device, and shortly thereafter it disappears from my device. When I try to download it again, the app will not allow me to download it a second time."
11076,AmazonMusic,Raphael Siciliano,2,3,App constantly loses connection even when sitting still with full reception. Songs suddenly stop playing and have to be manually re-buffered by hitting the play button again or it will not come back. Very tinny sound combined with lack of any kind of equalizer make the experience mediocre at best.
11077,AmazonMusic,TRUCK 303,3,4,I have had this app for a year now and it's honestly not that bad. it was free at first but now they want 8.39 a month that's crazy! it's maybe worth 8.39 for a year! here is what wrong with this app. does not have all the songs you want! if your out of the service area sometimes the app won't open! some songs are louder than others so your always adjusting the volume! some songs are not by the original but like close knock offs! other then that not a bad app better then others out there.
11078,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,"I have enjoyed Amazon Music from the start. I have learned (very easily) how to set up my playlists, how to download songs, albums, etc. I also use my Echo to play my music whenever I want, whether at home or on the go with my Kindle or phone. I'm 64 and enjoy a wide variety of music types, including Broadway show tunes, soundtracks to musicals, pop, jazz, classical and more. This is a wonderful benefit of Amazon Prime and I can't imagine not having this."
11079,AmazonMusic,Katina Lucas Roberson,1,5,"I am only giving u one star because I have had amazon prime for years... I love it even though it keeps going up every year.... But nonetheless.. I have been trying to use my Amazon music app for a while now.... I got thru once... However, for the last few days it keeps stopping on me.. Also it keeps popping up constantly to close app & send feed back... It's very annoying..... All I ask is to please fix it.. Then I will change my review back to a glowing one.... Thank you... Please fit soon.."
11080,AmazonMusic,Jeanna Magary,5,0,"I listen to music a lot. When I first got an Amazon Echo, I got the Echo music membership, but later I wanted to be able to listen to music when I was not at home. I got a new Samsung phone and Amazon Music works very well on it. I like browsing for new music, making my own playlists, and accessing my purchased music. They also have good playlists for music I like. Anyway, it only cost a few dollars more than the ""Echo only"" membership, and is worth it if you listen to music a lot."
11081,AmazonMusic,A Google user,2,0,"I tried the 90-day free trial, I made a few playlists and I planned on keeping Amazon music. Then for some reason every time I try to add more music to my playlist at a certain point, it always said no ""song is playing"". when the song was in fact playing. it did this in both my televisions and my phone. sent an email about it and never got a reaponse decided not to pay for it"
11082,AmazonMusic,Christopher Donlick,1,0,"Thanks for the reminder. Dont tell me what to rate your app. I give this app .6 stars, so its rounded up. this app blows for the following reasons: GLITCHY - freezes all the time, demands wifi even when the music has been recently refreshed. CRASHES - crashes all the time, most of the time it does not work on any device on the first try. must be restarted to work. BS PRICE - I pay for Prime, which should include whatever the hell i want to listen to. but instead you have to PAY EXTRA."
11083,AmazonMusic,Karin J. Smith,5,12,"Best music app available!!! Have been using this app since the beginning and it keeps getting better- add the Music Unlimited subscription to it and music nirvana! 99%of the time if there is a new song out or one I remember from 10 years ago, it's available to me through Music Unlimited. Best Music app around- and I can't live without my music!!!!"
11084,AmazonMusic,A Google user,3,0,"This app started out to be impressive. But as the days passed, it became more and more uncomfortable to use, dealing with glitch after bug, bug after glitch. $9.99 a month? Amazon, leave the music radio to Pandora. Stick with what brought you success, and that success is Not Amazon Music."
11085,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,1,"Freaking AWESOME! Pretty much every song I've wanted to download, I've been able to download. With the exception of a few. But that's still way better than what I've ever experienced with Google Play Music. Thank you, Amazon Music!!"
11086,AmazonMusic,Genevieve Currey,4,0,"decent streaming service, but sometimes doesn't have what I am looking for. I appreciate not having to wade through commercials, and my friends and I use my Amazon music account for this specific reason, but feel stymied when looking for particular musicians or songs. I do love no commercials, though."
11087,AmazonMusic,Loren W Burch Jr,5,0,Amazon Music doesn't work the same way Microsoft or YouTube does and that's to be expected. I AM glad that it's a good neighbor that it doesn't try to punish us for occasionally using something else. After ALL! Does General Motors ever try to punish for getting behind the wheel of a Toyota?
11088,AmazonMusic,Angela Malzow,1,3,"I continuously experience problems with this app. The app defaults to 'Browse Music' in stead of my library. It won't play certain albums, even though I own them (actually purchased them.) It sucks the life out of my Note 4 battery. The app also asks me regularly if I want to subscribe to Amazon Family. No. I'm already subbed to both Prime and single Unlimited Music. Support has caused more problems than they've fixed. So bad that my entire music list went gray and I had to add all my music."
11089,AmazonMusic,Aditya Agarwal,2,3,"The UI is VERY non intuitive. Its so hard to add music from queue to a new playlist. You have to add each song from the queue individually. Then to add all the songs of an album, you have to first add them to your library/cloud. then go to your library/cloud to add it to your custom playlist. i dont understand why do playlists have to be so difficult to edit on this app? Saavn has this so sorted. please fix this asap"
11090,AmazonMusic,Shauna E.,1,0,This app used to be excellent but now it either takes way too long to load or never loads at all. Not sure what went wrong but this is ridiculous and majorly inconvenient. Amazon shame on you. I'll be using another lesser known but more reliable mp3 player from now on. Good riddance.
11091,AmazonMusic,Chad Watson,2,4,"I hate this app. sadly Its one of the only ways to buy and download albums directly to your android phone. It is slow and buggy as hell. If you play music through the app, it will continue to run and hang out in your notification bar, even after closing, you have to force close it. I personally use a different app to listen to my music, but for some reason, a lot of the albums I buy through amazon won't show up for me to listen to in the other app after downloading."
11092,AmazonMusic,Jennifer McClain,2,0,"If I download a song, and later choose to remove it by removing it from my device, the app still shows the song as being downloaded. I have to clear app data to get it to show that the song is no longer on my device. The Android app doesn't allow you to clear the songs from recents /played. if you clear it from the PC app, it doesn't update the Android app. You have to clear app data. And if you clear cache, the recents /played no longer shows the album image. it is just a black square title."
11093,AmazonMusic,Jennifer Y,4,12,"Love Amazon music, for the most part. Sometimes songs or whole albums will grey out, but when I search for them they are still available, so I have to re-add them to my library and remove the ""unavailable"" ones. Other than that, no real problems."
11094,AmazonMusic,Mudit Rawat,3,0,"A wonderful service. Would definitely recommend. My biggest issue with the app is the fact that you can't download all of ""My Music"" at once. When you have more than 400 songs in your library and you will be travelling, it becomes painstakingly annoying to download each song one at a time. Also what I find irritating is the fact that download all feature already exists in the recently added to my music section so why can't we have it for all the songs in my music? Add this and have your 5 stars."
11095,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,"Does what i need it to do. Simple and easy. Which is great, I can't keep track of who sang what or wrote which song yesterday or way back when. Asking a couple questions and I find that song by Mariah Carey from my high school days. Plus operating the app is straight forward and intuitive. With options that allows me to down load for those time i can't get a signal. I use it often."
11096,AmazonMusic,Oron,2,0,"Way too hard to use, especially in a car. There's no quick way to reach my music or playlists and start playing them, and car Bluetooth integration is pretty bad too. If I leave the car and come back after a few hours I have to open the app and start all over again since it won't resume playing like Spotify does. Cat controls like playing next song are sluggish if they actually work. Finally, almost none of my non English music is available, but I could have lived with it if it was just that."
11097,AmazonMusic,A Google user,4,0,"Lets me listen to music like any other app. My one issue is a petty one specific to me. I'm learning Mandarin and would like to have a Mandarin station. Seems they are quite limited in that regard, I can type in different artist and their songs come up. Just seems compared to Apple Music their selection of world music is lacking. I'm not the person to ask questions of or respond to anything, I just got tired of seeing a prompt to rate this app."
11098,AmazonMusic,Tara Archer,3,8,"The app is easy to navigate. It has a nice look as well. But it's really disappointing that from time to time they take songs away, even songs that have already been saved to my albums without any notice. This is not a good feature."
11099,AmazonMusic,robstriker115,4,0,"I think the app is amazing and everything but I don't like the fact how sometimes the cover art from your song playlist have that gray screen. It happened to me like three times and it's not just that one song it did that to half of my playlist, and I'm annoyed how I have to delete it and re-added to my playlist."
11100,AmazonMusic,Brian Petty,5,0,"The app is a little buggy but I'm still giving it 5 stars because itnis loaded with content. The app doesn't handle the network to wifi handoff well and usually have to restart the app. Also every update seems to blow away my compiled playlists so that's a little annoying also. Other than that, it's great!"
11101,AmazonMusic,Bois P. Wilson,1,3,"would be great if not for fact that it loses playlists ALL THE TIME!!! Tried refreshes and clearing data. They come and go. Then some will appear on PC but not on phone. Sometimes Alexa can see a missing playlist, other times it cannot. hours of effort wasted!"
11102,AmazonMusic,Mehrab Dastoor,2,2,"I use this service because I have prime and its included, but to pay for more songs and have more popular songs sung by cover artists instead of the actual artists is a big negative to me. Having no ads is nice, but I'd rather use another service if I'm paying anyway."
11103,AmazonMusic,J.J. Forrest,3,0,"Battle for Your Bucks: I like using the app on Wi-Fi for downloading music to listen to on the road. I like the app better than Rhapsody, & iTunes. But I've encountered a couple errors & inconvenienced when purchasing music. So I updated my 4 star rating to 3 starts. However, Customer Service was quite helpful..."
11104,AmazonMusic,Katie Manifold,4,0,"i really like using the Amazon music app. The interface is really easy to use. The only reason i didn't give it five stars is because after making several playlists and playing them for a few months, songs suddenly become grayed out and are not available to be played anymore unless you buy Amazon unlimited. i already pay $130 a year for Amazon... i don't also wanna pay $10 a month be able to access songs that i was able to access a few months ago."
11105,AmazonMusic,Patrick Abraham,3,0,"The app told me to rate it 5 stars, so here is my short review. Besides just refusing to work from time to time, stop playing music due to a short data-connection loss while traveling, clogging up a good chunk of data storage, overlapping buttons making it impossible to reach the underlying set and only a fairly basic way to search for music, the app is okay. I would in no case pay any money for it."
11106,AmazonMusic,Sougata Som,3,0,"The music collection is extensive, but search is rudimentary to put it politely. Organization is extremely poor as well. For instance, you can't group your saved music grouped into artists ->albums, which is the most logical organization. When you're looking at All Albums of an artist, there's no way to separate the full albums from singles or list them chronologically. There's no artist info. Artist/album names aren't clickable. No songwriter info for each song."
11107,AmazonMusic,Steve Wall,4,0,"I really want to give this app five stars but there's a problem...whenever I stop the music from playing (if I don't close the app completely) sometimes later on (randomly - as far as I can tell) the music will resume playing at full volume! I'm sure it's probably something I'm doing wrong, not an error in the app, but if it's that easy to make that mistake that's just as serious an issue as a glitch in the app..."
11108,AmazonMusic,Jeremiah Tabor,1,1,"frustrating app that will not give you (the subcriber) the freedom to listen, even when you pay for it. I have paid then downloaded albums that still wont play in any of my devices. And if you do not have cell service or WiFi, this thing is worthless."
11109,AmazonMusic,Shelli Arbuckle,4,0,"I love Amazon Music! As a former user of iTunes, I have never found a music app for Android that compares until now. Amazon music is even better than iTunes. it has the same ease and variety without the ridiculous number of updates, software issues or having to keep a credit card updated. The low cost is more than fair! I would give 5 stars if the offline use were more user friendly."
11110,AmazonMusic,David Simpson,5,2,I am a high school game announcer and do introductions for various sports and contests. One of my playlists is Gametime and I put on it songs that I can play during pregame or halftime or during depending on the contest. It is awesome!
11111,AmazonMusic,Alex Losinski,4,79,"For the most part its a solid music streaming app. my only complaints are finding the stations that i want is harder than it should be, and they repeat songs sometimes. its cheaper that google play and my echo dot can use my playlists and such which is a plus"
11112,AmazonMusic,Vanessa Love,5,3,"I gave up streaming video apps for lent. I relied on this app to bring me through and it's great. It shows playlists I might like, saves songs and shuffles my purchased music. I also have prime so that helps with the song selection."
11113,AmazonMusic,Connor McGill,2,0,"There are still some nasty bugs that need to be worked out. When I add songs to a playlist it deletes a random amount of songs from that playlist. Also sometimes when I am using a playlist and click a song it will only play the one that is 4 spaces above it. very annoying, our lord Jeff Bezos would be disappointed:-("
11114,AmazonMusic,Miriam Pipher,5,4,"i love that i can find any song and listen to it at any time. i find new artists to me and I'm doing so broaden my genres. Also, iove being able to read/sing the lyrics to any song. making playlists with such a variety to choose from is terrific too. i love Amazon music. it's music for any more that i am in and every day."
11115,AmazonMusic,Manoj Budhwar,1,1,"i searched around 20 songs and 15 aren't on it.. very bad experience. and also company said .. search for 4-5 times and we'll add it automatically. but nothing happened like that.. and those songs, i searched, are popular songs"
11116,AmazonMusic,John Hagan,5,1,I was wary of paying monthly for music but it has been an incredible experience. I've got varied musical tastes and I always find what I'm looking for so no problem with inventory. so far the predictive algorithm is working pretty well but I've just started playing with that.
11117,AmazonMusic,Andy Solomons,5,3,"THE FACT I AM EVEN BEING ASKED FOR A RATING is comical. What can you say about AMAZON(without having your COMMENTS BLOCKED/BANNED/DEPLATFORMED WITH NO EXPLANATION GIVEN, EVER). After NUMEROUS ATTEMPTS to discover the reason(s?) so that I might make reparations and or apologies if necessary. MULTIPLE REQUESTS! #ZEROreplies. WHY SUDDENLY ASK MY OP NOW? IS MY TIME OUT UP?? LOL!! #ANTITRUSTnow! *GOOGLE IS AMAZON IS YOUTUBE IS MSM* The app is ok......but 5 stars gets my opinion posted."
11118,AmazonMusic,Louise Hurlburt,4,0,"Love This App! Wish I could rate 4 and a half. My only complaint is this: I have like 6 playlists. If I'm listening to my 80s playlist(for example) and then go listen to something else and then go back to the 80s playlist a few days later, it doesn't pick up where I left off. It'll start from the beginning. I literally have a written list of where I left off on each playlist. But I guess every song at your finger tips is worth the aggravation."
11119,AmazonMusic,Prakhar Sharma,2,24,"Well.. Compared to any other app of Amazon this one is the best I've yet come across...!! Loads songs super fast, no buffering problem, good categorization, and doesn't lags.. (unlike gaana) they may be short on some music.. but then again none can have all of it.. so excused! My opinion Go ahead download it âœŒï¸ðŸ‘"
11120,AmazonMusic,A Google user,2,1,"Great until recently. Whatever the most recent update was, the app now crashes shortly after I open it every time. This used to be my primary app for playing music, and hopefully a fix is on the way soon. But in the meantime, what am I paying $8 a month for?"
11121,AmazonMusic,Mike Liggett,3,1,"music keeps stopping when I try to do anything else, like use Google maps or something else. Doesn't happen in other music apps so I'm pretty sure it's this guy. Otherwise I like the layout and features. Once the above gets fixed then it'll be great!"
11122,AmazonMusic,Wasim Islam,4,0,"GREAT SELECTION. Can find almost any (English Language) song. Also, if you email Amazon about a song that you did not find, they try to add it to their collection. I took away a star because the steps and interface involved in purchasing a song can be quite confusing, frustrating and circular, with Amazon Music Unlimited subscription ad popping up in every step of the way, making it even more confusing to navigate. FIX it Amazon!!! Do some research on GUI Design and Storyboard. ERGONOMICS !"
11123,AmazonMusic,S Hudgens,2,0,"Frequently cannot access my music while offline because the app is looking for a data connection it can't find (I guess). Also, can't choose /remove folders so that I don't have audio books mixed with my music. Also, Prime selection of music has deteriorated: there are many songs in my play lists that are gray now and unavailable. I've been a Prime member for around a decade but living abroad right now the only reason to keep the subscription is the music, so..."
11124,AmazonMusic,A T,1,1,"First of all songs that I have downloaded into playlists suddenly become unavailable and you have to download them again!And Like other people are noticing all my songs that I used to get on prime are now gone, unless I now pay for music unlimited!! This app has turned into a RIP OFF"
11125,AmazonMusic,Kaz N,2,1,"App is not very intuitive. If you download a song, then purchase it afterwards, the file is not available outside the app until you delete it, then re-download. Finding playlists is also not obvious. Bad usability, needs a lot of work."
11126,AmazonMusic,Tony Capistrano,5,0,"Pretty F***ing AWESOME! I laughed until i cried. It sparked emotions in me that I still cannot understand. High Octane action at every turn. ""I'll have what she's having."" ""These are not the droids you are looking for."" ""There is no spoon."" ""Brimful of Asha on the 45."" Quit asking me to rate your apps! It comes off as desperate and needy. Why can't you just be quietly cool and collected? Let's not be like Zune. Make an amazing product then wait for accolades. By the way good app."
11127,AmazonMusic,A Google user,3,0,"The Unlimited plan offers started popping up before initiating the player for the past 6 months. Over the last month, about 10% of songs collected have been removed and are now only available as a purchase or the Unlimited plan. This is several per day now. The strategy to force customers into a paying plan. They got me, so I guess I'll go Unlimited. I'm disappointed with the sneak-up approach but the value of the past couple of years helped me discover new music and I'm thankful for that."
11128,AmazonMusic,Josh Kane,1,17,"Everything was fine, but now you're unable to download the songs you purchase to your phone. You have to stream it on the app, there's no other option. Total garbage. I'm happy I only bought one song and didn't waste my money on a whole album."
11129,AmazonMusic,Wes Cassady,2,0,Pretty awful app. Takes forever before you can even play music sometimes because of how long it synchs at startup. When you click download it either ignores you completely or it starts downloading 5 mins later. Sometimes it randomly crashes or freezes on me. Amazon should be able to do better than this.
11130,AmazonMusic,Nathan Goodhart,1,3,"I had an Alexa and was a loyal Google Music person. I made the switch to Amazon for compatibility and it was a bad mistake. Alexa doesn't do radio stations like Google music does and in general it's a bad system. I would type in ""today's top hits"" and it didn't get it. Just bluetooth w Google or spotify to your Alexa. Amazon music has a lot to work out....I am a prime member as well...."
11131,AmazonMusic,Christopher Smith,3,0,While the service is very good this app really needs a built in equaliser or it needs to open an audio session so 3rd party equalisers will be compatible with it. I would move from Spotify if they added this feature but as it stands unless you are happy with the default sound of your bluetooth headphones you will be stuck with it. It also seems quite high on battery usage but nothing major just higher than spotify.
11132,AmazonMusic,Wayne Fleming,5,0,"subscribed...what an experience with music ,found so many tunes from the past and present..created a play list for the first time....while my wife is watching soaps on tv I am in another world of my own ..drowned in music....would recomend to anybody.i would not do without this service..first class .Amazon is quality service.ðŸ˜€"
11133,AmazonMusic,David Beecher,5,0,"My life, well the one that consists of the music I listen to is conveniently contained on this. I have very broad tastes in music (think Bach to Twenty One Pilots to Johnny Cash to Enya) it's always here for whatever mood I'm in. l used to have 500+ record albums and later CDs. Almost everything I can want to listen to is always available on here. Of course there's a price, but all in all this is way more economical."
11134,AmazonMusic,Jackie Cooper,1,2,evidently I spent about $22.00 for music I probably did not want. It was a gift card. I could not figure out how to delete songs I did not want. I have a huge collection of cds. It seems rediculous to buy them again in order to use a device I received as a gift.
11135,AmazonMusic,Scott Hollister,1,2,"App is always trying to access internet for permissions. If it doesn't connect, it just hangs. If you don't have internet, you are not using this app. Amazon, get your permissions once a week or something, not every time the app starts."
11136,AmazonMusic,A Google user,2,12,"I use to love this app it was cheaper than spodify & pandora. However ! after a couple of months my music would appear unavailable, and I just listened to the song like 2 sec ago. Music just disappears and songs that are available you may have to redownload them even though they are already in your library. I need something that is consistent Amazon music isn't. Sorry, I had to cancel my subscription."
11137,AmazonMusic,Twanna Rampino,4,16,"ok, I love Amazon. Legit love. Here comes the however, (however) I feel like all I do is pay. Pay for prime, pay for music, pay for audible, pay for kindle library.. the downfall on their music app is that you can only play it on one device. If you want to play it somewhere else in the house on another appliance (tablet) nope.. gotta have the 'family plan'. Serious? Come on, cut a sister's wallet a break here."
11138,AmazonMusic,Azaz Ahmed,1,0,"It is actually an average application worth 2 stars, but then since it is from Amazon with such a large backup of collection of songs and funds, this should be rated negative. No Equalizer support, no settings available to tweak output to one's taste. And most importantly, the UI is one of the worst a music application can have. It simply doesn't have shortcuts or links to albums, artists as well as genre from random playlists. The recommendations are also pathetic. Needs big improvement."
11139,AmazonMusic,Lynette Hooper,5,0,"I've had Amazon Music & I've been a Prime member for almost 5 years & I LOVE IT! I hear music in my head all day long (yes, even when theres no music) then if I suddenly remember a song or artist I immediately look it up through Shazaam then see if Amazon has it, and so far, I haven't been disappointed. Keep up the GREAT work AMAZON! ;-]"
11140,AmazonMusic,G Shire,3,0,"good app for listening to new music. Low rate because unlike other music apps, Amazon Music does not have any information about artists or music. I loved reading about music on Pandora and Apple Music. And when trying to reorganize the queue, the songs dont move smoothly and freeze up if you try to move them further than the length of your screen. I reorganize my playing queue alot and this is really annoying. been using it for 3 weeks and these are the only problems I've noticed so far"
11141,AmazonMusic,J Dxvx,1,1,"they keep slowly gutting it and moving everything to the pay model. i am starting to wonder why i have or need Amazon prime.... if i do pay for a service, ill give my money to Spotify. seems like every few days more songs are removed from my playlists and moved to their pay service. not cool."
11142,AmazonMusic,Kris Veazey,1,12,"the app itself is great. turning my music off every few songs to ask me if i want to try a free trial of the pay service is not. I'm already a prine member and have answered no to this prompt a hundred times, so I'm going to give a lower star review than i normally would"
11143,AmazonMusic,Samer Aldroubi,3,0,"The Amazon Music app is great in some ways and frustrating in others. It tries too hard to push you towards you to their music service, and in doing so makes it hard to find and search foe music you want to buy or already own. On the other hand I like being able to download Prime music, which you can only do via this app (which is the only reason I put up with the other frustrations."
11144,AmazonMusic,Geena Leung,4,0,"Great app but has a few glitches. Whenever I reset the app, it always plays the same song in the #1 queue. Even if I delete that one song off my playlist, another song will take its place and stay as the first song played before anything else. Just wish they had a wider selection of music like Spotify does sometimes. This also takes quite a bit of data if you plan on using this with android auto."
11145,AmazonMusic,A Google user,3,0,"The app plays music well and in high quality, but I absolutely hate that some albums or tracks just go missing from Amazon Music without any explination. It's annoying and I can't find the song I originally had once it's gone weather it be a live version or otherwise. Songs from different albums also get mixed up making live albums chalky and not smooth at all, lots of the live albums by The Doors have this issue; different live recordings will play the same song but from a different performance"
11146,AmazonMusic,Logan Kroeger,3,0,"A good app with quite a bit of music, but user experience could be better. A lot of music i search is available only on music unlimited. It would also be nicer app if you could have multiple users, that way my wife and I could use the app and not have to mix up all our music choices."
11147,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,2,"the app is great, and I even upgraded to unlimited. however, I can't add or remove songs from my playlists. the function is there it's just not working, and it's really frustrating. also, songs (even downloaded ones) tend to skip like a scratched cd. along with that, I have an echo but the bluetooth wont connect. it only works in-app for amazon music, so I can't use the actual bluetooth doesn't work. Update: Everything has been fixed :)"
11148,AmazonMusic,Anju Sachin,3,0,"Really in love with this app....but the thing is, I'm a bass lover and I usually use an iOS device, and as you know, ios doesn't have equaliser for any other app other than the Apple Music. So, when are you going to add a 'equaliser and bass booster' tool in the amazon prime music app?? Please do respond."
11149,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,"Always listened to a different music channel. I was hesitant on trying any other. Then I built the courage. Said to hell with it , I tried ""Amazon Music"" .

11150,AmazonMusic,sigmond froid,5,0,"Personally, i have used iheartradio app, pandora and many other mshop l music streaming apps but by far Amazon music is my favorite. i get to listen to all the music i love without annoying interruptions. i love the variety, and diversity. its great and i can't have enough of it. I love Amazon Music period."
11151,AmazonMusic,All-Around Video Gamer,1,0,"It literally keeps crashing after I don't use it for awhile ðŸ˜‘. I have to keep disabling and re-enabling the app and I've also restarted my phone numerous times, which can't be good for it. Amazon, PLEASE release a bug fix update for this app so I can enjoy my music!!"
11152,AmazonMusic,Achyut Todi,3,0,"Good to have value offering provided with the Prime Membership. ***Can Improve:*** (1) UX to help arrange music more easily bw playlists (2) syncing playlist between online and offline mode (I have two versions of the same playlist in online mode) (3) PLEASE ADD FEATURE that allows user to choose which audio from his device is shown in the App. I don't want my WhatsApp voice messages, call recordings and downloaded alarm tones in my music app!)"
11153,AmazonMusic,Justin Keller,3,1,"Don't offer a lot of newer independent artists like spotify may. Sometimes, actually a lot of times, the random shuffling of songs plays the exact same songs and artists over and over again, regardless of the size of your downloaded library."
11154,AmazonMusic,Tesla Henderson,4,14,"I'm really loving this app. My main problems are somewhat cosmetic: it takes forever to open the app, especially if you don't have good service- which is strange becausw you don't need service to listen to offline music. Also, there's no way to alphabetize playlists unless you do it manually, one by one. And there's no ""favorite"" or ""star"" option like on most music players. Those 3 things aside, this is great for me. I regularly download 10-20 songs a month, so well worth the money imo."
11155,AmazonMusic,mark bonnar,1,15,"Well, whatever that last update was it has made this unusable for me... When I open the app there is a strange screen flicker, no problems I thought.... Music, starts playing, absolutely fine... Half way through the first song the track always slows down and starts to jitter."
11156,AmazonMusic,Randal Slutz,5,0,"I have used Amazon Prime and Music for many years. It has always been easy to use and has a great selection. it would ghee perfect if you could exclude bands/singers whose music you don't like from searches by using an exclude list that you don't have to enter every time. and notices when Prime music you've downloaded is about to expire. But overall, very goid service!"
11157,AmazonMusic,Chad Coe,4,18,"Of all of the Music Apps out there, I think this one is the best by far. I wish they would vary the songs in their premade music channels more often. Sometimes I don't want to play my own catalogue. I want to crank up something new that I haven't heard before. And then, it's the same music I heard last week. That's the only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5."
11158,AmazonMusic,eZwonTooFwee,1,2,"crashes constantly, deletes music you buy, playlists don't get saved half the time, ""unlimited"" music is constantly taken down and greyed out in your library, and to top it off you don't get an mp3 copy of the songs you buy anymore. absolutely horrible."
11159,AmazonMusic,Mayank Pandey,1,0,"I am so done with this app. I thought that they will understand that after an age we get irritated when we hear beeps or gaps for hiding the explicit words. But no. Even for the songs with explicit mentioned, I hear them being muted out. Amazon music guys, get a life and let me enjoy my music in the purest form. Will you?"
11160,AmazonMusic,Chantel Mohar,2,0,This is not a user friendly music app. It's difficult to navigate. One page pulls up certain stations or artists and another doesn't show that station so you think you can't listen to it. It's over complicated. Not to mention that you already pay for Prime but unless you pay Another $10 per month you don't get full use of all the music available. this is ridiculous when almost any other music app is less than $10 period. It does a pretty good job of playing a wide variety of artists
11161,AmazonMusic,A Google user,2,4,"Main problem is that it opens into online mode, so when I'm in areas where I don't get service I can't access my offline music. Huge problem for me. Also the recommended music is often way off."
11162,AmazonMusic,Mustang Big Boss,1,3,"Ever since the latest update music keeps cutting out. and not streaming music, downloaded music. WHY THE HECK IS DOWNLOADED MUSIC CUTTING OUT!!! I loved this app, now it's hard to listen to because its SO frustrating!"
11163,AmazonMusic,Patrick Karnia,2,1,Unreliable after Android updates. Sometimes need to wait weeks for an update to the app which allows it to run again. I'm even on an Amazon branded phone and I still have these kinds of problems.
11164,AmazonMusic,John Duey,5,0,"The movements within classical music do not stay together in the same order when downloading to my device. Reorganizing the movements is very cumbersome since their names can be quite long (names include composition, number, etc.). Soft links should be used to connect these movements."
11165,AmazonMusic,Eric Shroyer,3,0,"Ever since I upgraded to Amazon Unlimited, the app crashes or freezes frequently. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app, cleared the cache, closed all other open apps, etc., but it still keeps having problems. I never had any problems prior to upgrading."
11166,AmazonMusic,Scott Jeffries,2,0,"Awful app. Adds everything to your play queue twice. You play through something once, a second copy lingers in your queue, and you can't clear the app from your notifications until you manually clear your play queue, which is cumbersome and not easy to find. Skip the streaming and pay artists directly."
11167,AmazonMusic,Ryan Doherty,5,0,Switched from Spotify Premium. I love my Alexa devices so it only made sense to make the most of my devices with the music service designed for Alexa. The voice controls could be better with obscure song titles (though that could just be human error) but other than that the app is flawless.
11168,AmazonMusic,Cindy D,4,1,i liked the music quality over Spotify after extensive comparison. The lists haven't changed though in the months ive used this app. I don't care for their lists. i keep trying to love it but it's just a firm ðŸ™‚ not a ðŸ˜â¤
11169,AmazonMusic,Jodigirl71,1,2,"Won't load after critical update on LG Stylo3. Now that I bought a Stylo 4, I was downloading all music to SD card. My music should be on my card, no? Help! Do the developers look at the reviews? Does anyone?"
11170,AmazonMusic,A Google user,2,4,The only nice thing about Amazon music is all your music purchased from Amazon is automatically added to this app. Though it takes a long time to load/listen to music in this app. I can load a 1080p video on YouTube faster than this app loads music. The other thing is I have to keep my phone unlocked and screen lit up or the music player stops working.
11171,AmazonMusic,vatsal loomba,1,3,"I've been having a lot of trouble lately using this app and here are a few if them... 1. Whenever I try to edit a playlist or add songs to it it does not add in the end. Forming a playlist is a pain in the ass. You dont have the select or search feature for the albums hence you have to individually find them and add. 2. I often find music and albums missing from the artists page. 4. Again the UI is terrible, its very difficult to work with the app. 5. It also crashes like it just did! Please Fix!"
11172,AmazonMusic,Wyatt Knowlton,1,12,"Basically unusable. The app crashes constantly, the search function for ""My Music"" is incapable of finding things if they are not spelled exactly correctly, when this works in the ""Amazon Music"" tab. Additionally, whenever searching for any artist or song, I consistently have 10+ second wait times and it's getting very annoying. EDIT: One of my playlists is now COMPLETELY GONE! With no explanation whatsoever!! Someone please help! I cannot find a solution anywhere."
11173,AmazonMusic,nishitesh r,3,2,good sound quality. decent interface. options/features are trendy. -socpe for improvement: but slow updates to regions/country specific updates regional language latest albums releases are difficult to identify/search/find/play albums searching is difficult/no suggestions on previous (regional/contry specific) artists/lyricist/music composer/singer.
11174,AmazonMusic,sumit gambhir,4,5,"New review: much improved, no buffering now. Just need to update the default hot right now playlists a bit more often. Old review: It just keeps buffering. Whether I'm on 4G or WiFi. Even the downloaded songs keep buffering. YouTube works on 1080p flawlessly on the same network. But Prime Music can't even play a song without buffering. This is what happens when you just sell your prime membership as a package and don't give enough attention to individual elements of the package."
11175,AmazonMusic,Ross Revalee,5,139,"This is probably the easiest and most cost effective streaming music app you can get. Only one issue and that is after you listen to some songs, they disappear. I've made playlists and a song or two will disappear. But other than that I'm completely satisfied."
11176,AmazonMusic,Lee Rawlins,2,0,Interface is old looking and kind of strange to navigate. I've used both Google Play Music and Spotify. Making a radio station isn't as easy as Spotify or is as endless. When I shuffle an artist it plays both Explicit and Censored versions. I don't listen to the censored versions so there should've been a option somewhere to change that. There was not. I think I'm going to go back to Spotify because with them I get more variety of music with their radio and I get to make radios based of a song.
11177,AmazonMusic,A Google user,4,0,"Its good. Good selection of music. My only issue with it is that the stations always play the exact same songs, in the exact same order. Sure, it eventually gets to knew stuff after you go through everything youve heard. And yeah, you can just skip for a minute or two and probably get there. But no, im not going to do that. Fix this, and you get five stars."
11178,AmazonMusic,Trevor Roberts,5,2,I love the app. Totally brilliant. I buy a song. and then I can play it on any of my devices a few seconds later. AND I own the MP3. NO INTERNET. NO WORRIES. Love it. Especially those older songs that I grew up on. Totally magic.
11179,AmazonMusic,Kristine Campbell,2,0,"I travel frequently for work and pleasure. Apparently, changing between different wifi locations and different time zones creates issues for the application. I have purchased 283 songs; a week ago I only had offline access to 190 something of those after having to call tech support (for the 3rd or 4th time), their solution to reset everything, log off, log back in delete cache - and re download everything. I lost offline access to over a hundred purchased songs; this week I only have 91."
11180,AmazonMusic,Rahul Gupta,4,0,"Decent collection of Indian and international music but a little lacking on the indie front. The app itself is a little clunky and lacks many options like equaliser and multiple track selection but the streaming quality and availability of tracks is good. It's also supported by a well integrated Windows app for the pc. So, overall, I'd say Amazon music is a great choice for music streaming."
11181,AmazonMusic,Lonny Scarborough,4,0,"is awesome application, the continuous play feature quits when you power off vehicle and have to go in and start fresh search, it remembers the last song but only plays the last song you were on instead of continually playing , so as long as you remember to start app over you cant just restart and resume play , if that worked it would be a 5"
11182,AmazonMusic,Jillian Sinopoli,5,0,"I wonder how many other people are paying for IHeartRadio, while also having Amazon Prime and not realizing how much money they waste when they could just use their amazon music and have access to as much as the 5.99 Iheartradio subscription. I've been happily saving that money for about a year now."
11183,AmazonMusic,A Google user,2,0,"Was excellent...until recently. I've enjoyed Amazon music for over a year, and even got unlimited. Never a crash or issue. However, starting about two weeks ago, the app started crashing nonstop and has become completely unusable. even reinstalled the app. nothing has helped."
11184,AmazonMusic,Jose Plaza,2,2,"I just got Music Unlimited and im ready to cancel , turns out that music that i own and its downloaded to my device wont play on the app , not on playlists or just hitting play on my music , this wasnt an issue before , get your act together"
11185,AmazonMusic,Stuart & Bijal Atherton-Shah,3,0,"Music streaming is top notch. Not the best interface tbh, usability lets it down. scrolling a playlist is so annoying as you have to wait for the scrollbar to disappear before selecting a song or you jump back to some random place. Amazon really needs to focus on this in the next release and make it better!"
11186,AmazonMusic,brian mason,5,0,A really good app for me with a Prime account. Lots of classical music and treasures such as over 100 Goon Shows Tony Hancock and more. My devices have micro sd cards so that I can store off line music. This storage is not permanently available to play if device not connected to wifi. I find I can have a week before this happens.
11187,AmazonMusic,A Google user,2,1,I upgraded my phone and the app still thinks that there is a second shadow copy of my downloaded songs. Amazon has abandoned their cloud subscribers! I guess I need to switch to Google music that does not have these issues. Too bad that prime is not usable
11188,AmazonMusic,Duncan Haywood,3,0,There's plenty of choice here but the software to play it leaves a lot to be desired. From the lack of seemless playback to not being able to navigate smoothly through screens the Amazon Music app makes things about as difficult as they get. It's about time software writers stopped concentrating on function and have a bit of thought about what the users actually want.
11189,AmazonMusic,STEVIE MACK,5,0,"LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!! Amazon music where have you been all my life? Zero ads and zero buffering. I can listen without the use of WiFi or any type of internet connection whatsoever. I can skip and/or repeat any song at any time. And this isn't even the ""Unlimited"" version I have! Certain songs can't be downloaded or played unless you have the Unlimited version but I am overall happy with the version I do have. I highly recommend this music app ðŸ‘ŒðŸ¼ðŸ‘ðŸ¼ðŸ¤™ðŸ½"
11190,AmazonMusic,Suzy McCarrell,4,8,"I love Amazon music.. it plays great on my Android without any major problems plus I love that I can play my playlists thru my Alexa. I used to use Apple music but it would constantly stop playing.. or continuously buffer which took awhile to stop & play or the app would just stop working altogether. I dont have any of those issues with Amazon Music. Songs on my playlists do turn gray & become unable to play, but it's about 1-2 songs in a 3mo period.. For that, I gave 4 stars."
11191,AmazonMusic,Tiffany Farver,4,0,"I love the app. I wish the search tool was better. You have to know the exact song title or artist to get what you're looking for. Also, I wish it had more stations based on the song and more stations based on artists. Other than those things I use it often and so does the family."
11192,AmazonMusic,Wynelle Ulrich,3,0,"I hate what Amazon has done to xray lyrics. Recent updates feed one line at a time, often late in the verse. The previous implementation displayed at least 3-4 lines in advance & behind, acting as an extremely useful tool for those wanting to sing along or interested in learning the lyrics to it. The new limited display does more than making efforts to learn the song impossible. It actually removes any way of the lyrics being useful at all."
11193,AmazonMusic,Nicole Wright,5,9,I like how this app can be very song specific and with the ability to download it onto your phone to create your very own play list to avoid any surprises of song that you don't like or want to hear. For example I am creating a playlist for my 20th wedding anniversary and I can put the playlist on shuffle or play it in order. I love it! I also like how I can listen to it offline to avoid it running up my data on my phone.
11194,AmazonMusic,al neill,2,2,wont refresh and it expires and removes songs that I paid for. why would it block access to music that I bought from amazon . it tells me I have to refresh my music but nothing happens when I try to refresh. running the up to date version.
11195,AmazonMusic,A Google user,3,0,"I am a big fan of Amazon & I want to like this music app, but it has several very annoying issues/ bugs. The metadata service it uses continues still (for years) to do a poor job with album art. my collection has all the art already, but Amazon's service can't , refuses to use it, so 1/3 of my 300 albums have no art! The user interface is awkward with some of the most basic functions searching, forward, backwards, up-download of my library & various features r poorly designed & don't even work."
11196,AmazonMusic,Jonathan Santana,3,0,"3/5 just because this application crashes/freezes/stops way too much. This can't be Amazons app... the company that is changing everything... couldn't hire better app developers? let me go a bit into depth and give you guys an example; I go on IG while my Beats studio 3 are connected via bluetooth. I go ahead and play a video so my music stops, when I try to go back to my music the app completely freezes to the point where I have to go in my settings and manually reset it... that's one of many."
11197,AmazonMusic,Wayde J,2,0,"Needs a lot of work. Stored songs skip, sound volume is not consistent. The search function generally shows songs that are not included in the Amazon Prime account, trying to get members to pay more for a specific 'Amazon Music' membership over the already expensive Prime membership. Going to go back to Google Music and cancel Prime. Does not work with Samsung watches."
11198,AmazonMusic,Sarah Tankson,5,0,"I love Amazon music. I must say that Alexa along with the powerful music, has helped me through my pain and soothes my soul and spirit. This app is the best from experience. It's not totally free, so I hope to share with you that I wish it was totally free, but nothing that's this healing and helpful comes free of cost."
11199,AmazonMusic,Rafael Torres,2,1,"constant disconnection to my devices and need to restart the application, greatly disappointed, about the music collection it's average, there is room to improve and I think they need it, if they want to be competitive and excell !! king regards"
11200,AmazonMusic,nicholas gazella,1,1,"used to be a really good app, until they started charging for it. now half the songs that I have downloaded to my phone I can't play because its locked me out of them until I pay their monthly cost."
11201,AmazonMusic,Samir Saxena,4,0,"Started to use this as it become a part of the bouquet of services amazon offers under Amazon Prime. Good collection of songs and updated with latest albums. Unlimited downloads for offline listening. Playlists are also good. Giving a star less for intuitiveness of the app. When you click on a playlist, you expect to see the songs but it starts playing the playlist instead."
11202,AmazonMusic,A Google user,1,12,Absolute garbage. App deletes all offline music if you log in to a different Amazon account on the Amazon shopping app!! Also it spends far too long with the blue spinning circle doing nothing when I just want to play music. A very poor app.
11203,AmazonMusic,Joe Hernandez,5,1,"music's good, lil buggy but not very much at all. nothing closing and reopening hasn't fixed. could use a better selection, but what they have now is pretty great, from obscure to popular you can find just about anything you're into"
11204,AmazonMusic,T. H.,1,0,"Not navigation friendly, so easy to make the wrong selection if ur not careful and the slide bar on the side is so sensitive, layout could use an overhaul. App doesnt have option to autoplay in vehicle when connected to blutooth in the car,which is time consuming bc u have to go to the app then choose the playlist etc. when I get in my car, I want to connect and go. for an amazon product, this is a big disappointment."
11205,AmazonMusic,Chris Gerstle,1,5,"refuses to remove old offline music - when I refresh, the files should no longer show up on the list!!  can't exclude audiobook directory, very stupid.  blocks stations that shouldn't be blocked album covers (that I don't care about) don't update"
11206,AmazonMusic,Carl S,1,0,"really not user friendly at all, while it does have a good range of music there has been times that I've searched and ended up playing a song that isnt even by the artist i was searching for and its been a really poor quality cover. Playlists on amazon music are not the best either i found i couldn't just search for a playlist that was wanted to listen to so really not good for someone that likes to change up the music theyre listening to day by day."
11207,AmazonMusic,Jorge .Buonomo,2,0,"Sames songs over and over, keep showing bands that I clearly dislike since I had hit the dislike button everytime, if you hit the dislike button by mistake, the only way to fix is going back, so if you close the station, good look to you (on mobile), if you dislike one song, guess what? you will get the same song but in the ""greatest hit"" production...Amazon it is STILL the same song I disliked,anyway I got it free thanks to AT&T just lasted 3 months before I went back to others paid services"
11208,AmazonMusic,Dean Storm,1,0,"I love the service for the selection, but I have 5 different devices, but it takes 10-45 minutes to choose any music and have it start playing. it always takes this long when trying to choose anything from my music to play.

11209,AmazonMusic,A Google user,3,0,"Doesn't search well, primarily, you have to be exacting. sometimes you get negative search results then later find the song by a different way. Kind of cool the format is not upgraded but a bit simple and outdated. Can find most songs, not all. Slightly confusing options, purchasing/download. Overall very useful in filling my phone with music."
11210,AmazonMusic,Antonio Reyes,4,0,"although great, even with Alexa. it is still missing some music. The app itself is great. Easy access, simple menus and nice handsfree optiona. I gave it 4 stars. For me.... it needs more voice command options. Like ( i've tried these but maybe it doesnt have it) Go to last song, skip # of songs, slow down tempo, replay whole album with shuffle.... something like that."
11211,AmazonMusic,Anthony Richard,5,1,"Based on the overall muaic experience of using music apps overtime. Navigation through the app is good, i'd lile to see a differnet color scheme layout that makes it easier to navigate on thw eyes at more time constraining times. Overall easy use and wide range of options."
11212,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,14,I really like being able to go to sleep and have the music turn off by itself! The sleep timer works very well and no more waking up and to a dead battery if I forget to plug my phone in!

11214,AmazonMusic,Anubhav Sharma,4,12,"It is heavily lacking in international selection, as compared to Spotify. Only few K-Pop and J-Pop artists are listed. Many Popular artists are absent as BTS is the only one whoch is fully covered. It is good that it is bundled with other prime benefits as it lacks a shine which can attract money on it's own. If you have Spotify Premium, there is no need for Amazon Music. And if you are like me, who is only a prime member, for songs not listed here go to spotify free."
11215,AmazonMusic,A Google user,1,2,"Despite paying for the app, it will randomly display the following message: ""Song Not Available We're sorry, but this song is no longer available in Amazon's catalog. REMOVE THIS SONG"" , even if you have downloaded the song to an SD card or internal storage. The app has grown buggy lately. It will often display artists and songs on screen, contray to actual songs and artists currently playing.

The streaming is dependable and the app very easy to use and to find different albums a doddle. You can make playlists of your own musical themes. It just works.

11226,AmazonMusic,Abhijeet Biswas,4,128,Like Amazon Music Unlimited please introduce lyrics feature in prime music too. And another thing please switch from 256 Kbps to 320 Kbps quality which would be great to give a tough competition to spotify. I like amazon prime music but those two things would make us love it.
11227,AmazonMusic,Petra Robinson,3,0,"Regardless of whether I'm listening to downloaded music or streaming, I run into a buffering issue (the music stops) whenever I drive/walk through an area with a weak cellular signal. This is understandable for streaming music, but NOT when I am playing music that is already downloaded to my phone. Extremely annoying"
11228,AmazonMusic,Akash Mehta,4,11,"I would give it a five star but, there are some very famous bollywood songs that aren't there. For that, I have to go to some other app. Other wise, it's an awesome experience.. Especially the way the Playlists are made, there are some Awesome songs that would habe gone un noticed if it wasn't for these playlists... It's my ""Go To"" app for any songs, Any mood I have. â¤"
11229,AmazonMusic,Milan Ann Mathew,2,23,"It doesn't let me listen to a song completely... It'll repeatedly crash in between the song! Not an app I would suggest for music lovers. I'm giving 2 only cos it has collection, for using the app I will give only 1!"
11230,AmazonMusic,Ian Hunt,5,6,"The radio is not as good as pandora, but selecting and playing back any so i want is a great feature. Their selection is good, and it gets updated weekly, but it doesnt have the smaller names i love like pandora has. Fantastic service tho"
11231,AmazonMusic,Amber Poole,2,0,the new user interface sucks. the push to spend money is unappealing. everytime I open the app I have to navigate through windows and adds and just prompts to get to my music. if I didnt have a huge library (purchased when I actually appreciated the app) I wouldn't use it.
11232,AmazonMusic,Hanna Kindness,2,0,"It not only limits you with prime unlimited, but it just uploaded and undownloaded all of my songs, and made roughly 15 songs ""unavailable on Amazons catalogue."" I really wanted to love this, but its just really annoying to redownload all these songs, and have so many albums and artists only available for prime unlimited."
11233,AmazonMusic,Stephen Vaughan,4,3,"Must type songs by name or artist in search bar perfectly accurate to find what you are looking for..Not good if your looking for a fifty year old song.It would be nice to search by lyrics. It could be done. I'm not much for spelling. After the first few languages I learned, it's not so much of a big deal. Dont matter how stupid they accuse you of being, they know what you are saying."
11234,AmazonMusic,maria pedroza,2,0,so far with the new update it's been crashing and will play song slo-mo till I unlock my phone then starts again and this is happening on my downloaded music as well. I hope they can fix this because it's really irritating when I have to continuously be unlocking my phone. UPDATE<<< I have since changed the background app setting to not turn off and hopefully this works will update in a week.
11235,AmazonMusic,Axel Lells Hjelmqvist,1,28,Has a free trial Downloading music sometimes fails and some download manager crashes. Do expect music downloads to fail in the background without notifications. Also fails right away sometimes. Listening to music on wifi seems to work ok and navigating the app seems to work.
11236,AmazonMusic,G1 Sunstreaker,4,0,"Love the interface, but been having problems with downloaded music appearing in the library. I have quite a few songs downloaded onto my phone's storage, and even hitting refresh music/check for new downloads is not turning up anything. Have tried moving music into Amazon folders in phone directory to no avail. Not sure what's gone wrong, starting to look for other apps since I continuously encounter this problem with this app."
11237,AmazonMusic,Matthew Phillips,1,12,"how disappointing. I'm unable to change songs via the ""previous"" or ""next"" buttons, instead I have to go back to the playlist/album to select the previous song. Also can't jump to specific places in a song. These are super basic features for any music player so for that reason I'm giving 1 star."
11238,AmazonMusic,Calvin Zito,5,0,I started using music services way back with MusicMatch. ThenbI moved to Microsoft because I had a Zune (hate iPod and iTunes). Now I'm all in on Amazon Music. I love that it learns what I like. The recommendations are always spot-on and much of the time I find myself listening to what it recommends for me.
11239,AmazonMusic,Holly Zybura,5,5,"I was referred to this App from a Good friend of mine, started the trial & it has a vast selection of music! it has minimal to no ads, will continue to use app bc it's far superior than past music apps that I've used. Excellent service ðŸ˜€"
11240,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,free app. many free MP3 songs albums for streaming or downloading. works best if you have wifi and Amazon prime subscription or account but I sometimes use it as a standalone with music i have downloaded. i just purchased about 235 tracks for 15.00. some albums and some singles. only annoying thing is that it constantly tries to ask you to upgrade to music unlimited. Amazon premium streaming plan. i keep saying no thanks. but it keeps asking every hour. prime already gives you around 2M.
11241,AmazonMusic,Jennifer K,2,0,"I really dislike this app. It won't sunc with Alexa, takes way too many button pushes to load a playlist, and is the only player to automatically receive my music purchases. Keeps prompting me to waste data on the streaming plan, almost no music I like that I haven't already bought and downloaded. impossible to open or close quickly."
11242,AmazonMusic,A Google user,1,22,"So the ""free"" Amazon music account you get with prime let's you do nothing. if you want to actually listen to bands you like, you need to get a Â£10 subscription. This is what's called dishonest advertising."
11243,AmazonMusic,Meghan Byrne,5,0,A great app. I tend to use it to listen to music while i work and some of the playlists have introduced me to artists and songs that I probably wouldn't have listened to. I definitely prefer it to Spotify as I am not forced to pay in order to enjoy a wide range of music ad free.
11244,AmazonMusic,Steve Rayburn,1,5,"the interface is slow and a bit confusing switching between offline and online music. It's too difficult to get to the store to purchase music and some music isn't even available to purchase and is only available through ""unlimited "". Songs keep disappearing from my playlists and from Amazon music app entirely. Amazon music used to be a better experience than this in the past."
11245,AmazonMusic,Brian Dennison,2,0,"lots of loading, lots of temp. unavailable. I would set out for my walk, grab a water bottle, lock my door, turn on and connect my headphones, select Amazon Music... and wait for Amazon Music... and wait for Amazon Music... close Amazon Music, restart Amazon Music... wait for Amazon Music... restart my phone...select Amazon Music... wait for Amazon... and it's not available. IF THAT WAS ANNOYING TO READ, GOOD. BECAUSE IT IS MORE ANNOYING TO EXPERIENCE. Fix it and I will update my review. Thanks"
11246,AmazonMusic,A Google user,4,0,"I use this app full time all the time for all my music needs actually. The one thing I really dislike though, is that the app cannot be used AT ALL in Samsung DEX Mode unless you start playing music BEFORE you plug the device into the DEX station. The app will NOT open while the device is in DEX Mode."
11247,AmazonMusic,larry burrow,5,0,"wasn't expecting much. I'm huge on Google play music but, you offer something they don't..., solely a single band not just a station where you hear 3 or 4 of a bands songs the 30 other bands a computer has determined sounds similar. haven't been able to shut it off sense, thank you."
11248,AmazonMusic,Carol Segovia,4,0,"while the app is pretty great overall, i wish we could sort the playlists. when you add a song to a playlist, that song will forever stay in that place. no sorting by song title, by artist, alphabetically, nothing. would really come in handy when you're looking for a specific song to play."
11249,AmazonMusic,Debbie Miller,5,3,My girls and I love this. We can jam out to all different types of music! Makes for a great car ride and to lighten the mood when they aren't getting along at the time - Thanks Amazon Musicâ¤
11250,AmazonMusic,Synthacus Rex,4,0,it does some weird things to music that you already have on your device. but I don't care anymore it has all my music in a more organized format and introduces mee to new music related to my tastes. I also have tried music I've always been told is to my taste.
11251,AmazonMusic,Rodrigo Brito,1,4,I was disappointed with the app. I expected to obtain an equivalent service such as Spotify or Tidal. But the lack of content and the unfriendly user interface is really a bummer.
11252,AmazonMusic,Tim Fox,1,2,"Missing many essential features. Unable to give songs a 1-5 star rating or similar. Unable to export/import playlists. Does not show song popularity on all screens (this feature seems random, in some screens you can see the popularity of a song, in others it's missing). No easy way to bulk remove songs after you've downloaded them. I'm an Amazon Unlimited subscriber and I buy CDs from Amazon, but Amazon is only good for discovering new music, it's awful as a music player and library manager."
11253,AmazonMusic,Cannabis Education Festival,2,0,Great app.. would be 5 star... needs a opt out of artist setting... I would use the controversy with Michael Jackson as an example... there may be religious reasons people don't want to hear certain music.. just some kind of opt out... that sitting alone is that important to me and I'm sure others
11254,AmazonMusic,Bill Bray,3,0,Last week it was crashing constantly. Very annoying. Cleared cache etc....no impact. Would eventually work. Problem occurred on my Android and Fire device so I am pretty sure the problem was at Amazon. Seems to be working better this week. Time will tell.
11255,AmazonMusic,Stephen Nelson,2,0,"enjoy the service but the app is poor. downloaded songs appear and disappear, when selecting songs for a playlist the plus or minus clashes with the scrollbar, app is unstable and crashes when playing parts of songs in the music store, songs downloaded dont download in mp3 format meaning i can open them in another player. very disappointing."
11256,AmazonMusic,Keith Whish,2,0,"My downloaded music won't play. I bought these songs and should have access within the app. But noooo, it makes me use my music player on my phone. Which brings me to my 2nd point, equalizer, will you please add an equalizer to the app?"
11257,AmazonMusic,jiny tuls,4,0,"its cool. it has options, for example offline mode and online. love lisiting and downloading. Amazon music app is much nicer than pandora. tho, for me. i just got AI. So.. soon ill be a cyborg like the rest of you. Although, can anyone let me know where to find a workshop on how to use smart devices. thanks."
11258,AmazonMusic,David Oddone,5,0,I'm giving this 5 Stars simply because of the collection and availability of music. the app it's fairly easy to navigate and playlists are super easy to make as well. The one thing I wish they would improve on is creating more music stations not blends genres. I very rarely feel like listening to only one type of music
11259,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,9,"Wow, this is the best Music App I have ever had. I can get every single song and every single Artist that I want. Period point blank! It's touch friendly and you can even download whatever you want. Here's the kicker though, you have (ALEXA) who takes you to wherever you want to go. Awesomeness!!!! Thank you Amazon and thank you ALEXA. IF I could give more Stars, they'd get a 100."
11260,AmazonMusic,PrInCe KaMal,5,3,great sound quality and decent collection of music.. and no ads at all.. as its in prime.. only one thing i feel missing.. it does not have good playlists.. update your playlists and create more.. i never found a nice playlist in this app unlike other music platforms
11261,AmazonMusic,G sn,5,0,"my favorite music app! it's easy to use, allows me to listen to music online and offline and even pulls the music I have in my phone into it so I can combine libraries. I do have a prime account, so I'm not sure how well it works without one, just food for thought."
11262,AmazonMusic,John Silverton,2,0,"Good selection of music, but the audio quality is pretty poor when listening on a decent hi-fi system, in fact the quality of some tracks are so poor I can't listen to them. Amazon please start using flac lossless files and you will have a great service."
11263,AmazonMusic,Robert Mullins,5,0,"The Best Music App I am an Amazon Prime subscriber and as such I can listen to whatever I want to hear. I use the echo and can with a simple request listen to all of the music I want to hear, regardless of style and obscurity.... highly recommend!!!"
11264,AmazonMusic,Adam Schillinger,3,0,"It's great that this is free but the ""station"" feature is DOA. Stations play one song by that artist then go to a random mix of music that isn't consistent with the genre, time period of the original song or artist that was chosen for the ""station""."
11265,AmazonMusic,John Frazier,5,0,"yes iam very intune with an good music venue or quality music service. which an good one is provided by Amazon Music.i enjoy the music i personally enjoy listening to on my schedule. Amazon Music service is the best music apps available to everyone. So join the most favorites music listening group.out there by far. I would highly reccommended the Amazon music service as the priority best go too music app. To enjoy all your personal favorites you remember years ago, and also you newest music hits."
11266,AmazonMusic,Kathleen H,2,0,"i had just reviewed this and as soon as I did, it started disconnecting and acting up. I'm using LG bluetooth headphones while my phone is in a pocket and the music stream was fading in and out and losing connectivity to my headphones that are under 2ft away. So, 2 stars come off for that."
11267,AmazonMusic,Akhil Garg,4,0,"this app is really amazing. There is one thing that i do not like about this app. when we logout, all the downloaded songs are deleted from the memory. again we have to download all the songs. please fix this issue otherwise this app is worth 5 stars."
11268,AmazonMusic,Robert Calvert,1,1,"Absolute trash! Because with prime you get access to half the app there is an additional membership to ""music unlimited"" required. My advice is to get something like Google play music at least with it you get the entire app plus YouTube red."
11269,AmazonMusic,Mqfr Dejd,5,0,it plays my favorite music and so I can charge my phone and also listen to music so I can not use my echo and it's awesome because it's connected to Echo. And it just plays it for you and you can make a playlist and then have Echo Alexa or computer play the playlist that you can design yourself so you don't have to like Echo I'm at this into my playlist do this did I do that you can just go and search up your favorite song at the playlist and you can choose from your playlist.
11270,AmazonMusic,Kayeinel,3,0,"there's music described as ""explicit"" that isn't explicit. I want my explicit music to be explicit! they need to fix this!! When I try putting Eminem's ""Arose"" on my playlist, it says it's already there, but scrolling through my playlist shows otherwise"
11271,AmazonMusic,Mike Meza,5,1,my experience with amazon music is been great I like the no commercial or ads and that u can build a playlist to listen to anytime u want and if their is anything u haven't heard in like forever all you have to do is type it in the search and it usually comes out of their amazing library.I would recommend this to all music lovers out there this is the only music app you will ever need !
11272,AmazonMusic,Jeff Brandimore,2,0,"Great for the most part. Very annoying if you try to use with Android Auto. Very often Android Auto can't start playback until you exit, launch Amazon Music and dismiss the ad for Music Unlimited. This happens about once a day for me, and is hugely annoying. Face it: for many users, Android Auto is the main use case."
11273,AmazonMusic,Simply Jeff,1,3,Cannot cast my offline library to my Alexa devices. The app claims that content can be sent to my Alexa devices but when I try I get an error that the content is not supported. The file type in question is a simple MP3 file. My other Amazon MP3s can cast fine
11274,AmazonMusic,sscott2420,1,7,"Update 2/19/19 The app is continuing to delete all of my downloaded music. I'll download stuff and it will last maybe 2-3 weeks. Then it deleted all but 10 songs that were on there from 4years ago. Update* the app just deleted all ofthe music I had downloaded the past week. The app stops working a lot. Suddenly it will start ""buffering"" when I'm listening to downloaded music and then my sound quits working a lot I have to reboot to get it working again."
11275,AmazonMusic,A Google user,4,1,some factual error I observed ..in a Song from 1970 bollywood film prempujari the credit for lyricist is given as Neeraj Sridhar..which is wrong..The lyricist is Gopaldas Neeraj..or popularly known as Neeraj..Neeraj Sridhar is a Singer..please check these factual errors.. App is very good..but these factual errors needs to be corrected...
11276,AmazonMusic,Steve C,2,4,"Used to be good, but went downhill after Amazon launched Amazon Music Unlimited. Songs and bands that used to be included with my Prime membership moved to a more expensive plan. Now the Amazon Music app keeps nagging me to spend another $95.88/year on top of my current $140 Amazon Prime membership. On top of the extra cost, Amazon Music doesn't integrate with Android Auto as nicely as Spotify ot even Pandora. While Amazon Music technically works, the interface feels like an afterthought."
11277,AmazonMusic,Robin Sayers,3,0,"I was super excited to find that Amazo Music was included with Prime! The first few days I started using it were very enjoyable, however, be aware that they want you to upgrade for another $7.99 per month to listen to the most recent releases. If you don't mind not having access to current albums, it's a great app!"
11278,AmazonMusic,A Google user,4,0,"I would have given 5 stars except that several months ago I bought the MP3 version of the Allman Brothers Band album Live at the Fillmore Extended version for approximately $15.00. I was able to listen to the album for a couple of months, but suddenly it just disappeared from my list of music and it is no longer available for listening although it is still on my list of music. Can someone tell me what happened?"
11279,AmazonMusic,Pj L,4,0,It's not as user friendly as some other apps but I get a lot of free music with no ads. Only one person can use it per account though. And sometimes previously free songs are no longer available. I like the ability to diwnload songs to my phone that are free so I don't have to have wifi or data to listen.
11280,AmazonMusic,Mike Mahnken,3,0,"Why can't I create a play list on the fly? Situation: The music is playing. Buddy says ""Hey, I like this song. What else is like it?"" What I would like to do is queue up another song by the same artist/genre/vibe without stopping the current song, but I can't. Seens easy but it is not supported."
11281,AmazonMusic,Rachael Phillips,5,6,"Always reliable! This app is the only music app i use. I used to use pandora radio, but now i strictly use this app based on reliability and no commercials. I use it for workouts, running, or just chillin. Love it!"
11282,AmazonMusic,Luck Pho,1,2,"bug where it keeps popping up to tell me to change my download settings for offline music. i keep clicking dismiss, but it pops up about 3 times, then sometimes goes away, other times the pop up keeps going..."
11283,AmazonMusic,Saran Sheerajin,2,9,"horrible interface, playlists and downloaded music get ""lost"" - requiring you to delete everything and start over again. no way to mark it flag favorites. music station search is terrible. can't choose a station based on genre or artist/song type."
11284,AmazonMusic,Michael King,1,4,"What a rip off, how's about full access to 50 million songs free for prime members instead of a measly 2 million, typical amazon always trying to extract more money from people, bloody nora do you not think you's make enough money out of people, come on man give something back to us will ya!"
11285,AmazonMusic,Misty Rowe,4,0,"Overall, the app does what it's supposed to: play music I've purchased from Amazon and play prime related music. Only complaint is how it'll just stop playing music on frequent occasion. No warning, no explanation, just a closed app or stopped music."
11286,AmazonMusic,Rene Sarradet,3,0,"Most of the music I began listening to has ended up on music unlimited. I already pay for a membership that boast ""free music"" to listen to. Now I will have to pay even more to prime so that I can have the music I want. What's the point of a membership then?"
11287,AmazonMusic,Ana Aguirre,2,0,Not too thrilled... This app doesn't stream very well compared to my other music apps. I am a huge Amazon fan but the music app just doesn't cut it.. and as a prime member you still don't get unlimited service. They recently raised the price for Prime yet they eliminated features.. Deleting app.
11288,AmazonMusic,Aaron Zuniga,5,0,I love the music on the app. I will say I don't like how much the cost is combined with all the other amazon stuff I always add on with ha ha... But if I have to pay for some sort of subscription for music it most definitely have to be Amazon Music fo to the sho!!!
11289,AmazonMusic,Lakota Outlaw,1,0,"It's quite frustrating. My app closes multiple times, when I first open it. After reopening a few times, I'm able to play music. The worst part, I paid for a year of service. Also, the app won't download my playlists... other than that, it's gold."
11290,AmazonMusic,Christopher parsons,4,0,"Exceptional, it's nice having a ""free"" music subscription with my Prime account. therearea ton of selections to choose from and CDs bought through Amazon get added to My Music. I dislike that there is no longer a playlist when selecting a station to listen to."
11291,AmazonMusic,Brian w. Murphy,5,0,"Amazon music blows you tube and I â¤ï¸ and pandora radio away! Period! $7.99 for unlimited music is worth every single penny! I'll never use other music apps ever again! If you love Rock, hard Rock and Metal and anything in between this is the best!!! Im pretty picky about content and Iam never disappointed!!! Thats saying a lot!!!! ðŸ˜Ž"
11292,AmazonMusic,Susan Douglas,4,1,love the app. it's great for streaming my downloaded music when I'm in flight. also have connected some of my playlists to alexa. it's a little frustrating that some songs cost money. not willing to pay the extra.
11293,AmazonMusic,Jeremy,3,0,"the app itself is convenient, but sometimes songs in my playlist aren't accessible and the shuffle plays the same songs over and over. There are so many songs in my library that I haven't even heard. And there are are many songs again still doesn't carry."
11294,AmazonMusic,Ryan Gould,2,4,"amazon Music lost all of my playlists...thousands of hand picked songs for various applications. Thinking not a big deal, right? I Have a cranky 4yo who needs ""his music to calm down"" from behavior issues and Amazon dropped 95% of ""my music"" playlist songs with no explanation. i am not happy to say the least and neither is my son!"
11295,AmazonMusic,Larry K,2,12,"Amazon music continues to loose content, even for Prime members. They continually bug users to join there unlimited music service. Very irritating to always need to click no to the unlimited service, only to be bothered again several days later."
11296,AmazonMusic,Ankit Lakhmani,1,2,"Pathetic application. The app fails to play downloaded tracks in the absence of internet. While playing, songs lag irrespective of the fact whether they are downloaded or not."
11297,AmazonMusic,Sachin Paranjape,3,0,"Good streaming app. But not very user friendly. Does not suggest other songs. I have to search for it. 'Stations' are not well defined. For e. g. If you chose 'Eminem' station, only first song is Eminem, followed by random songs. Indian music is not well represented."
11298,AmazonMusic,JeenaLeigh Graham,3,0,"I enjoy the fact that this app has pretty much all the music I'm looking for and can play offline, BUT only if the app was already open with internet. I notice that the app will not load if there is no wifi/data connection which sucks because i do most of my listening in the car, with no internet."
11299,AmazonMusic,Dick Dale,5,0,"It's a very usefull app. It has a very wide spectrum of music, including old Soviet propaganda songs, german songs from the 80s, and Ukrainian songs from now. Just don't delete the file in your files app that says ""Amazon music"". I made that mistake and lost all my music lol."
11300,AmazonMusic,Elizabeth Murray-Stanziale,5,0,"love this app!! I gave the other music apps a try- I really did but they just couldn't give me exactly the song I wanted right then! Our family revolves around music & w/7 personalities, we're all able to have our own playlist! No commercials, any song we can think of ON DEMAND! And... its soo easy to add a new fav to our favs!"
11301,AmazonMusic,matthew nelson,5,0,"I love using Amazon music to listen to music. It is easy to listen to a channel with just one artist, or a channel with other music you may enjoy based on an artist. It is a great way to listen to old favorites and to find new favorited. I also listen to some stand up comedians using this app."
11302,AmazonMusic,Okan Andrew Celiker,2,1,not happy with the app performance. the songs I download to listen offline keep disappearing and this is annoying. One day they are available offline and few days later available only in online mode. Otherwise it is a decent app.
11303,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,"This is one of the best music apps that you may find. The interface is very organized, it is very intuitive, it works really well and the app works with Alexa and Alexa works really good with headphones or without headphones. Another plus, the audio has lyrics and the app shows the user the lirycs' line"
11304,AmazonMusic,Maya R,1,2,constantly losing music. constantly being logged out. when signing back in all offline music downloads are gone. all playlist music are gone. app used to work fine a few months ago. now it is completely trash
11305,AmazonMusic,Todd S,4,0,"crashes periodically, mostly when screen rotates. make sure to change streaming to fastest unless you have unlimited data plan. Some stations are just big playlists, they will repeat exactly after a while, others seem to be more random. Like other apps stations better but the total catalog here is much bigger."
11306,AmazonMusic,Tracie Dungan,4,0,"Love it that some of the CDs i bought on Amazon recently had this auto-rip feature where the album instantaneously downloaded onto my tablet without me having 2 do anything, save 4 a quick download of the Amazon Music app, but once that was done & i clicked the download button, the CDs i bought with this feature downloaded automatically, & lickety split too, so that I was able 2 listen 2 them right away either offline or online, well B4 the CDs arrive in the mail 1 to 2 days later!"
11307,AmazonMusic,Lou Allison,5,0,Love love love it. I already have Prime so this is just a bonus. Easy to use and I have not experienced any problems. Unlimited skip the songs i dont like is Gucci too. Thanks to everyone at Amazon. Your all Gucci too. Peace~
11308,AmazonMusic,the whole solangleo fandom,4,0,"I love this app! Just annoyed that they keep moving more and more songs from the Prime to the Unlimited. A lot of my favorite songs used to be accessible but aren't anymore, and if they would stop taking songs away it would make five stars."
11309,AmazonMusic,A Google user,3,0,Decent app to navigate on Android and desktop PC with plenty of music choices. I was not able to download music to my PC though even with online help from Amazon. could download music on Android device to SD card but cannot find in those files either. trying to download music for my sons mp3 player and the website is pro ving difficult to do so.
11310,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,2,Pretty intuitive. Find a station and play it with no commercials if you're a prime or Amazon unlimited subscriber. Easy to create your own playlists and did I mention no commercials while you are listening if you are a prime or music unlimited subscriber.
11311,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,"This is the best music app that I have seen out lately..no annoying pop-up ads or no more skips unless u sign ur first born over... I will forever be grateful for this revolutionary music app..truly feel free to hear what I want, at the very moment, I want.."
11312,AmazonMusic,Inge Ã¶,2,3,"When you don't have any signal offline mode takes years, also there's no options to ban some artists that you don't want to listen to. Those things works in Spotify. I'll pay again when the app gets better."
11313,AmazonMusic,Rhiannon Cooper,1,0,update: the last couple of months it doesnt play without stops. i have some playlists made with offline music for flying. if i play them and the phone sleeps the song finishes and thw next one doesnt start. absolutely useless. I love the app most of the time. In offline mode it pases at the end of every song until i wake it up.
11314,AmazonMusic,Joshua Croom,4,0,"relatively easy to use. I do wish they would offer greater content in the basic Amazon Prime membership tier without having to pay for the Unlimited plan. It seems like the majority of the popular artists' songs, which most oeople are familiar with, are only available with the Unlimited plan."
11315,AmazonMusic,Phanindra Nadadoor,3,0,"Amazon Prime is a better one..as the prime pack includes Prime Video, Music, and Shopping. These people can make the look much better. And add new releases to the home page. Wync music, Jio music are better than this one. But as a prime customer it is cheap to us. Try to develop the looks."
11316,AmazonMusic,vipin kumar,3,0,Below are the features i liked and disliked: Liked: - High Quality Songs - Very good library - No ads. Disliked: - Only thing so far is usability of this app. It adds the whole playlist to the queue instead of the song I added and thus it ruins the flow. There should be play now or just the selected song should be added to queue.
11317,AmazonMusic,Victoria Pritchard,1,1,"Doesn't integrate with Echo devices. About to move to Google Home due to the shoddy integration and support between this and Amazon prime music. For such a large company, this ridiculous lack of user friendliness is reprehensible. About done."
11318,AmazonMusic,Andrew Baker,3,0,"Often times albums are incorrectly sequenced or combined with singles of the same name. very frustrating. also annoying that from the now playing screen you can't hit the ""back"" button to return to the last viewed page. it just closes the app."
11319,AmazonMusic,jacob kuzma,4,0,"great service, but dont like how the app stops playing due to what seems to be the result of lagging network speed. I thought that if you chose to download music that that music shouldn't be negatively impacted by slow network speeds but that doesn't seem to be the case because my supposedly downloaded music still lags during slow network times"
11320,AmazonMusic,Mark Miles,1,1,"Too complicated. I just want to legally put songs onto a thumbdrive to play on my usb car stereo. I'm using an Android tablet and it only saves it to the device and not the thumbdrive, which I selected."
11321,AmazonMusic,Joyce Carter,5,0,i use this app to play my music in the car. i pick out music that i have not heard for a while and new stuff. There is a large library of songs and even larger selection with unlimited music. There is a monthly fee with unlimited. I enjoy listening.
11322,AmazonMusic,Chris Younger,5,0,"I have no issues with this app. its solid and works. not so much on xbox1, crashes sometimes more often then comfortable with. paired with Alexa and an echo. music for days even without unlimited. no ads if a prime member. so it beats spotify both online and offline."
11323,AmazonMusic,Claire Betzhold,2,0,Love this app when it works. It works perfectly fine and then all of a sudden it starts exiting me out almost immediately upon opening. The only fix is to uninstall and then reinstall the app. It then works fine for a while until the issue starts again.
11324,AmazonMusic,SashJo,4,0,I love the amount of music I can listen to on here. There is even music from obscure meme musicians which is awesome. Taking 1 star because I'm paying for Prime so why should I have to pay another additional monthly charge for music? Still love it tho.
11325,AmazonMusic,Alan Holder,5,13,"my carrier services provides Amazon Prime Music, Video, Shopping and Google One with my unlimited plan. 5 ðŸŒŸ for free! Just wish you could download to device storage and use your media player. external storage not an option. Media Rights"
11326,AmazonMusic,Benjamin Sargent,3,0,I love the fact that I can download the albums and individual songs to my device. I hate that my phone has to establish a connection first in order for the app to play the downloaded music. It defeats the purpose. I was hoping I'd be able to play the music when in poor signal areas. however the selection is fantastic.
11327,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,14,"PERFECT!!! This music app...or Amazon music has everything and if I could underline everything 25x I would!!!!! I will NEVER use another music app...not ever, because this has every single song..by famous names and even Glee...or people from the Voice like Jordan Smith and even our beloved Christina Grimmie!!! If u dont have unlimited music....get it!!! Its fairly inexpensive every month so...TRY IT!! I rate them 8â˜† outta 5â˜†"
11328,AmazonMusic,S.A. Stoneking,4,1,Good all around app. My only gripe is that I would like to be able to permanently set my start screen. The store shouldn't be the default starting point every time the app restarts. That's the least used location.
11329,AmazonMusic,Vigneshwar Pasupathi,5,0,"Awesome music streaming app. Using this since it been on action. Lots and lots of great collection added upon time. Playlist collection in each genre is a tailor made considering the taste of users. Most used friendly application, to top it of Alexa integration was the coolest one for tech freaks. It's ad-free streaming for prime users is a plus to stay in the competition with other streaming app which have their dedicated plans."
11330,AmazonMusic,Stephen R. Hayes,5,0,"I switched to Amazon Music when Microsoft shut down their Groove service. I miss the option with Groove to put my own uploaded music in playlists (I'm sorry if this feature exists within Amazon and I just didn't notice it) and I wish the band Tool was on here (can't blame Amazon though, because Tool isn't on most or any streaming services). These are minor grievances so this app still gets five out of five from me!"
11331,AmazonMusic,A C,3,2,The version included with prime is a great bonus with a large range of tracks available. If price was lower i'd upgrade to unlimited for the full range of albums per artist. giving only 3 stars due to excessive cost of unlimited.
11332,AmazonMusic,Brittany Bergh,1,0,"This app is constantly stopping and ""refreshing"" in the middle of the music playing, and sometimes I can't get it to start playing music again at all. I try exiting and reopening and making sure it's updated - doesn't help. It's very annoying that I'm paying for an app that doesn't work properly!"
11333,AmazonMusic,Anshika singh,3,1,"There is a problem with the application. Even while using good network, the songs stop streaming and when I go to the app and change the song, it starts streaming. This is very annoying. Please correct it."
11334,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,Amazon music is purely AMAZING! I work for a carnival company and I use this app to supply all the songs that I play throughout the day and evening at various fairs and festivals! No more just using an mp3 player or using YouTube to select each song individually. and killing my phones battery within 3 hours. with this app it runs seamlessly with my needs and my phon3s battery lasts from about 11am untill about 10 pm before I need to plus it in all the while this app always runs in the background!
11335,AmazonMusic,Jwill Sing,2,1,"Terrible for Offline Use Appears to be using data, even when I listen to downloaded songs (My Music). When I turn off data, the app is extremely slow. Songs I download through Amazon do not appear in other music playing apps."
11336,AmazonMusic,A Google user,1,4,"The latest revision is a huge step backwards.  Nothing but popups trying to either push you to turn on mobile data or to purchase the full music membership.  Also uses a lot more battery power. DO NOT UPDATE to this version (March 14, 2019)"
11337,AmazonMusic,max marck,3,0,"Good music selection, janky app. Most of the time, after leaving the app while listening to music, I'll try to reopen the app, say to pick abother song, and my music will NOT load. Every time, I have to close the app and reopen it."
11338,AmazonMusic,Stephen Conners,5,0,Good selection of music and I like using it with my Echo Dot 3rd Generation. Also use the Amazon playlist when I'm working out or just want to relax. Songs are easy to find and purchase. Overall I have had a great experience with app and service.
11339,AmazonMusic,Rohit Mishra,4,0,"The app is great. I noticed an issue just yesterday though. When I tried removing a song from an album in my library, the app crashed. The song would get removed from my library, but I had to restart the app with every song's removal."
11340,AmazonMusic,Kip Abell,4,0,Excellent interface with lots of features. well put together. my only complaint is that it has a hard time accessing music stored on your phone if there is not good service... like it needs internet access to just play offline music. kinda lame.
11341,AmazonMusic,Faith Black,5,0,"I had premium, and I love it. Im able to creat my own playlists, save all the songs I want. Download my favorite songs. Skip, repeat, and shuffle songs, and able to see lyrics as the songs plays for some songs. I can also listen to songs by any artist or album."
11342,AmazonMusic,Cecilia Alvarez,3,1,"The app lags from time to time. The songs get interrupted because the app lags/buffers, not sure if its my reception cause I never had this problem with Google Play. And aside from the app, the songs disappear on the website."
11343,AmazonMusic,Hitesh Khatri,5,0,"One of the best apps, let you download the songs and play offline (if you have Prime Membership, which comes at a very nominal charge, much cheaper than Gaana or other paid music apps). The best thing about the app is, the playlists, which have well selected songs that's gonna suit all your moods."
11344,AmazonMusic,Rhonda Dyer,5,0,"I enjoy the app tremendously, I am just waiting for Amazon to give discounts on Prime, Kindle, and Music Unlimited, such as bundling services for a lower price. As far as the app itself, I love that the music is not interrupted while checking messages or using the internet."
11345,AmazonMusic,Phillip Powell,5,1,"Love Amazon Music Unlimited! I do wish that there was a way to store/manage/edit/etc... externally, and not have always rely on and pay for that capability. Maybe a way exists and I'm just not aware yet."
11346,AmazonMusic,Heather- DivineChaos,1,0,Love it but u know u WAAAAAY overcharging me. ðŸ˜ž Why the hell I never got my 3 months at 4.99? And why as a student and Amazon prime member am I paying 10.99 a month? I've called and you guys still don't fix the issue or adjust the billing.... Seriously about to cancel this service. Ain't like these songs aren't available elsewhere....
11347,AmazonMusic,London L,4,0,"I like the app. I have something like 10 different playlist. I wish the lyrics would come back. This was the app I used to learn the words, but right before a talent show performance of ""The greatest show"" the words dissapeared."
11348,AmazonMusic,Brad Beckwith,1,1,Purchased unlimited but all downloaded music just says expired. Refresh of the downloaded music will not refresh. Now I've purchased the songs outright and I still can't play them. Fix your garbage app Amazon!!!!
11349,AmazonMusic,Bhavin Barot,4,0,"Good collection of music. i really like the Station. One star less, cos, you can take a playlist offline at one go, But the reverse process is quite monotonous, as you have to remove songs one by one to free up the memory from your phone."
11350,AmazonMusic,I'm Jeff's girl,1,1,listen befor this update happen i could download music and listen to it offline . all of w sudden it updates and every time i download new music my old ones disapear just like todsy i open the app three more songs i had is gone i thought yall was the one ..what's going on?
11351,AmazonMusic,DK Phillips,3,1,"App frustrating. Won't stay on an artist when asked. You get one song by selected artist, then your choice is dumped for another artist in same genre. Even selecting ""station"" doesn't help. Very disappointing."
11352,AmazonMusic,Amitmohon Mostafi,5,0,"Editing my previous review after 25+ days of exclusive usage. Its now my preferred App for listening to music and related. Also, my first time exposure with 'Alexa' and boy i like it so very much...!! Its like 'cherry on top'... and thats what differentiates Amazon Music from rest of the online streaming services."
11353,AmazonMusic,Gregg Austin,4,6,"glitchy. Restarts itself periodically while streaming. Little to no control of AI playlist, called ""my soundtrack."". I liked several Christmas songs during the season and now it thinks i still (2 months later) want to listen to them and similar in the genre. i like different genres depending on the moment, so i wish i had the ability to control/edit my liked songs and what I want to hear or not hear."
11354,AmazonMusic,Jeff Nason,1,0,Ever since the latest update with android auto I can't play any of my playlists. If I select them on the phone they play just fine. I can play all of the Amazon prime streaming ones that are pre configured without a problem now. Really messes up my kids playlist to get them pumped up before the big games.
11355,AmazonMusic,Greg Tonn,4,0,"Amazon Music has a decent selection of music, but there is always a song or two I cant access/find. I like that you can download the songs to use and acces offline as long as you pay your subscription. Overall, this app/music service is a great addition to your Prime subscription."
11356,AmazonMusic,Andrea Picarelli,5,0,"I love Amazon Music! I love the variety of music! I can listen everything from Top 40 to Classic Rock, to Meditation music! This app uses very little battery and data! So easy to create playlists! I love being able take all of my music with me without having to sync or download."
11357,AmazonMusic,A Google user,4,0,"almost all of the music i want to listen to is available in this app. having Unlimited is a good value, as well. the only thing i woukd suggest is to add a Pandora like feature where a random selection of like music coukd be played if you havent done a custom music list. i know there are playlists but youre reoegated to the songs on the list."
11358,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,1,came with Amazon prime membership but made me an instant fan. provides latest content. easy to make playlists and save songs for offline use. just improve the song quality a bit and provide equilizer. also please dont take songs off the app once introduced.
11359,AmazonMusic,NAKUL SHARMA,3,0,"As it offers all the required features of add music streaming app, but still it is missing on many features like creating a playlist is a tough task as it does not allow to add multiple songs at once, user had to add sings one by one. Also The player shoots you up tobthe top of tge list of songs from which user is creating playlist which annoying and makes it way more painful. Amzon Please make it more User-friendly."
11360,AmazonMusic,Darren Dunford,1,24,"I can't believe how awful this app is. So laggy, buggy and clunky. You'd think Amazon could build a half decent app. I guess I should give them a break since they're just a start up though :)"
11361,AmazonMusic,James Haskins,5,9,the app is great after you figure out all the changes. my only problem with all this is the way apps try to help carriers sell data. everything is geared tiwards causing you to use more data. all disguised as convenious. Dosent anyone realize they will raise the price as soon as you are dependent on it?
11362,AmazonMusic,Shevy S,5,0,"I pay the small fee to get the pro version, and its awesome. all the music I could ever want in the palm of my hand. and the download option is very convenient when you are trying to save data. I give it 5 stars because it has everything I could need . I dont have any complaints."
11363,AmazonMusic,Charlie Doray,5,0,From newest hits to old time favorites. I can listen to what I want when I want... Best music app I've used... I constantly recommend this app to friends and coworkers... I have the family subscription so my wife and daughters can enjoy it too...
11364,AmazonMusic,Tina Hanrahan,5,0,"Just love Amazon Music, always has something new to listen to. Being able to download and sort my playlists to what I wish to hear when I wish to listen is brilliant. Am not using it long so have not probably figured all the features yet, but what I have so far I am really enjoying. ðŸ’š"
11365,AmazonMusic,Joe Pierson,2,1,use to love it but now they are greedy and want more money when it use to be that prime was enough. stop being greedy amazon!!! prime isnt even worth it anymore and now we keep getting limited on our music!!
11366,AmazonMusic,Baldwin Creative,5,0,"Favorite music app. Works well crossplatform from Bluetooth mobile streaming on mobile speakers to new Ford truck ðŸ˜ðŸ‘Œ pre-equiped to talk to Alexa to connect to your music, or audible books. PC to create and organize playlists to que up with Alexa on the go, or listen to pre-existing playlists based off your listening interests. I pay for premium unlimited to have access to everything for the price of a CD. Not a paid rating, just long time user. I will admit I use Bandcamp to find new ðŸŽ¶"
11367,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,1,great selection of music! It is rare that the search comes up empty! I use it for making set lists of the music my bands play. Some of the songs are very obscure and the search always finds them!
11368,AmazonMusic,Thomas Farrell,4,0,I am updating my rating of this app from 2 to 4 stars. I love the selection of songs and artists available with Prime music and they have cleaned up a lot of the bugs that were in previous versions but it still has room for improvement. There is still a ton of potential and thank you for making it more reliable.
11369,AmazonMusic,Daniel Halicki,1,0,"I realise this isnt android related, but I use an old iPhone 5 for music in the car, and Amazom Music on iPhone requires iOS 11 which the iPhone 5 does not support. Looks like it's back to Spotify for me. Also the PC app is web based and rather limited. Needs a lot of work before I would recommend using it."
11370,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,Yes there are a fue songs i could not get becouse of the amazon unlimited mode. Buy i can still get a large prosentage of songs. I say around 90% for nothing. Just add them or do whatever. Download make easyly made free playlist with lots of songs. And share the acct with your family. Or share playlist or songs with friends. Easy to find the songs to just serch by song name or athor. Adding to playlist is easy to. Have fun and enjoy lots of music.
11371,AmazonMusic,paul coleman,1,2,some songs dont play properly and when playing songs they just stop and need to skip to the next song to carry on playing. which is hassle at 6am on my pushbike in the dark riding to work trying to get your phone out and not drop it.
11372,AmazonMusic,J C,2,0,Difficult interface and poor music search engine. its very difficult to to work with. playlists shown on some screens only. search engine does not show much options. songs have to be downloaded one by one. This is not for me. I am going back to my previous music service
11373,AmazonMusic,David Duarte,5,0,"All my past and present favorites at a tap of the screen, and I can arrange playlists for huge blocks of continued playback. Easy way loaded and way Hassle Free. Started with free version you get with Prime, then upgraded to the Unlimited for little more added to my prime membership. Totally worth it, in my opinion."
11374,AmazonMusic,A Google user,3,0,music becomes unavailable on your playlist. Selection is ok but not great. Spotify is better they have a bigger selection and music doesn't disapear off my play list. For the casual listener Amazon is probably fine. I have a broad taste in music and Amazon doesn't really cut it for me.
11375,AmazonMusic,Tammy Fields,3,0,"I guess I was spoiled with Pandora. Was hoping for similar experience, but I'm just not seeing it so far. Pandora seemed easier to use and had more variety of music. With this, I have to pay to get more music. So much for the ""benefit"" of Prime membership."
11376,AmazonMusic,Lisa Shah,5,0,"I would like if Amazon Music had the option of a zero second skip in between songs. Some of my albums are in story mode (meant to be continuously played) and that 2-3 second pause in between songs really throws off everything. Otherwise, I love this app."
11377,AmazonMusic,Richard Dunlap,4,0,"great for listening to specific albums, songs, artists. Good playlists & stations. my only complaint is the inconsistant recently played list. When reopening it has a very spotty record of what you listened to in the last session."
11378,AmazonMusic,stevefullwood,3,0,"amazon music is a good app overaul but it needs an easy to use interface for when one is driving and is listening to there music, the app needs to stay open and have a big button thet you dont have to focus on for moving to next track, car friendly keeps a drivers eye on the road, I know we probably not supposed to use it while driving but people always will"
11379,AmazonMusic,John Wallace III,5,0,"Best line up because...I made it!!!!! With the help of Amazon Music, I put more then 400 of my all time favorite songs, into a playlist!! I can put them in order of the download,or mix them all up! Now, I choose what to listen too! Great lineup!!!"
11380,AmazonMusic,Daniel Davies,4,1,"I would have given it five stars, but I have given four. Just for the fact that I can't justify paying an extra Â£7.99 a month to have music unlimited on more than one device when I already pay for Amazon Prime."
11381,AmazonMusic,Maddie Arlene,1,3,"I have been using Amazon Music and paying for it for several months and it's been absolutely amazing. Till recently. The songs keep skipping unless I have the app open on my screen, it's very annoying and I think I'm going to switch apps because I'm sick of listening to music that constantly pauses unless the app is open."
11382,AmazonMusic,William Desch,5,9,"Great for music with terrible notifications. For an app that streams and allow you to download music or listen to radio stations based on music preferences, I think this is a fantastic app and would rated 5 stars. I have had to turn off all notifications for this app. When the song changes I will get two to three notifications over top the music. Extremely annoying. The only way I could stop it was to disable all Amazon Music notifications. Edit: notifications are fixed. Changing to 5 stars!"
11383,AmazonMusic,Richard Rushton,2,3,"You have to purchase the Amazon Unlimited to listen to most music you may like. I had Amazon Prime music for a while then stopped my subscription. When I chose to pick it back up again, the bands that I listened to were no longer in regular Prime. They wanted me to spend the extra money for their unlimited plan."
11384,AmazonMusic,Gopal Pathak,5,1,Its one of the best music app. I doubt there is any song or station you can't find in the app. Managing my songs and playlists etc are also easy. Also managed to link Amazon Music to my Google Home too! What else would you need?
11385,AmazonMusic,Tangella Brown,4,0,Great free music. Would have given 5 stars if music selection wasn't so limited. Other music sources offer more albums for some artists than this service...bummer if you're looking for a certain son and have to go to another service to find it. Otherwise I like being able to compile my own pkaylists.
11386,AmazonMusic,Elizabeth Owen,1,2,"edit: highly dissatisfied with the app. i have bought a lot of music over the years and would have continued to if the app was actually functional. its not. highly disappointed. I use this app a lot. for the most part is fine, good selection and you can download your purchased music. but i find it crashes quite a bit ans has a hard time loading songs and artists if you are using the search option."
11387,AmazonMusic,Sheila Songster,5,3,"Amazing Amazon is what I call this music app!! It always has what I am looking for, except for a few obscure requests, which are difficult to find anywhere. It even suggests music I ""MIGHT BE"" interested in, based on what I already listen to. Thumbs way up and HIGH FIVE, for the Amazing Amazon Music app !!!"
11388,AmazonMusic,trustdivinemercy,3,0,"A lot of great music has been dropped from this platform (Prime Music) and in its place they have cover bands - or remastered versions that lack the heart and soul of the original songs. Some good stuff still remains though, so overall it's alright but not fabulous."
11389,AmazonMusic,Jeff Stahura,3,0,I use because I have music from amazon and Im familiar its simple but it blinks a few times every time i open it. It works like it's supposed to but I have to download stuff twice to get it offline I don't like full screen Pop-up that keeps asking me to rate it.
11390,AmazonMusic,Richard Reese,1,0,"I have used this app for its ease of access to great music,... until I found out how badly they treat the people behind the music... to quote my great friend in Nashvile about AMAZON and SPOTIFY, you can't feed your family when they offer you $100 for 1million downloads... please don't support money hungry apps... buy music from people... i am DELETING AMAZON and SPOTIFY for my part. I like CDs more anyway."
11391,AmazonMusic,David Van Wert,5,4,This is the best one i have ever tried. They have about the biggest song library I have ever seen in a suscription. Im an android guy so Im not down with itunes. I tried spotify and pandora. They arent the same. Spotify is better for suggestions but thats about it. I love this app. Its in my car everyday all day.
11392,AmazonMusic,Bryce Calton,5,0,"Love the music catalog and the app is great. Here's a feature request Amazon - when I hear new music/artists, I would like to be able to link to their wikipedia page to learn more about them. Even better, stream artist bio ingo on screen while I continue to listen. New age pop up video."
11393,AmazonMusic,Vaibhav Bhala,3,0,Using moto g5s plus. Most of the times notification controls freezes. I have to again and again open app for changing music. Even when I clear the app from background the notification controller does not disappear. I have to clear 3-4 times by opening and closing app to make notification controller disappear.
11394,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,1,"Works like it should, only a few obscure songs aren't available. Well worth the few bucks, Alexa voice control works great while driving. Not at all disappointed in leaving spotify."
11395,AmazonMusic,Cptn Tight Pants,1,2,"I pay for unlimited, why do songs and albums gray out hours after adding to my music? what the hell am I paying for? Do not waste your money with Amazon!"
11396,AmazonMusic,Evan Wade,3,1,"I signed up for the free account included in my amazon prime. This app unknowingly has been charging me 15 a month for a year for the unlimited plan and I never knew. I never knowingly signed up for this. I feel scammed by amazon music. I was under the impression I was only using the free service. Why would i sign up for a family plan if no one but myself is using it? I am going back to apple music full time. idc if im paying, at least its somerhing that I agreed to."
11397,AmazonMusic,Devendra gaonkar,1,2,hope less team have been sending the app crash mail for more than 50 times still no solution. this is the state of a app which is on paid model. if it was a free model i dont think so even thr songs might have been updated. very bad experience
11398,AmazonMusic,Larry L. Chidester,3,0,"Great to a point. I have CDs in mine and because THEY DONT USE ANY CONSISTANT FILING SYSTEM , YOU CANT FIND MOST. THEY NEED TO NAME THEM BY COMPOSER S LAST NAME FOR CLASSICAL AND PERFORMERS LAST NAME FOR EVERYTHING ELSE!!!!! I HAVE TO KEEP A BOOK TO FIND ANYTHING! Pop or classical singers can appear under their name or the album title, so without my book for 300 CDs good luck finding the Carpenters or Christian Tetzlaff or even Joshua Bell. Very few have their respective names in the titles."
11399,AmazonMusic,Rajiv Issac,2,1,i switched from Apple music to amazon thinking itll be better . Turns out its worse than apple music . The player suddenly stops playing or skips song or gets stuck in the middle of the song. Moreover there is a big lack of songs compared to apple music
11400,AmazonMusic,Terry Raines,5,3,"totally enjoying Amazon Music since I've been using it. I download the new music I want on release day,and I'm saving alot of money on not buying so many cds.,and believe me,I've spent tons on cds in the past. The same in the records days. Well with the 8 bucks a month. I highly recommend it."
11401,AmazonMusic,Lorraine Graham,5,0,This is one app I would give more than 5 stars. I love it. I am a bluegrass and southern gospel lover and I have loads of cd's but I have trouble sleeping at night and getting up to change cd's is not good but streaming with amazon lets me enjoy the music I love and get some rest.
11402,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,"The recommendations are seriously on point. I've discovered more songs and artists in the last month than I have in 5 years. Unlimited skips, and backtrack if you accidentally skip. Being able to control from the lock screen is a nice plus. All in all, very user friendly."
11403,AmazonMusic,Tre' Moore,2,0,"Amazon Music seems to take all the songs that appear on your song lists and move them to the unlimited list, even when I have subscribed to the unlimited list, specific songs on a CD will not be able except for separate purchase. I think it is best not to share my song list."
11404,AmazonMusic,Shawn Unthank,3,1,Does the job with my own music and downloads. I got the family plan but my 20 year olds tried and went back to the big S. I prefer Pandora for stations in their variety. Amazon starts looping back way too quickly on some stations.
11405,AmazonMusic,Dresden Kilnik,1,0,"They take back all the digital versions of albums you get from purchasing physical discs after your Prime lapses. Prime has had every feature gutted that matters, and this abysmal mishandling is just one more reason why I'd rather go through all the steps of ripping discs to my PC and manually putting songs on phone than to fuel Amazon's corporate greed. Shame."
11406,AmazonMusic,Yasmine Ruchamah,1,3,this app is constantly glitching. when I call in they tell me that I cant download any songs unless I want to uninstall the app monthly. I cant even make a playlist either because it wont ket me add certain songs. I pay for unlimited.
11407,AmazonMusic,A Google user,1,0,"Overall performance is poor. Audio-wise: gap between songs when using Bluetooth. Library-wise: recurrently but unpredictably, I have to restart the app in order to get access to my music list, whether I'm looking for new music, recent purchases, or my music library at large."
11408,AmazonMusic,Dwayne Dwayne,1,11,"I pay for a prime membership which includes video, music and 2 day shipping. What a crock of ssss. Prime music doesn't give you access to all the songs, only the crappy ones. They want you to pay MORE for those. Note that iheart and pandora are free. I'm already paying for a service others offer for free. Why should I pay MORE for better songs? Prime video is the same thing. Free 2 day shipping is a sham too they just raise their prices a few bucks to cover the extra costs."
11409,AmazonMusic,Ashley Burns,1,1,The selection of music and limitations of the app is very frustrating...I only got it because I got an Echo Dot for Christmas and I use my Google play music on it. But it's definitely not worth it.
11410,AmazonMusic,donald may,1,3,I gotta listen to music I put my headphones in put my phone in my pocket and the music stops have to pull my phone back out of my pocket turn my phone on watch it spin like it's trying to connect then it connects and starts playing the song again then it stops again I have full connections full bar this makes it very difficult to wanna work out to Amazon music
11411,AmazonMusic,G Cracker,3,0,"Good and bad. Unlimited music customer Good: Lyrics for most songs, huge library of songs, playlists, sharing, family accounts. BAD: Crashes often when using other apps - music will just stop and app must be reopened. Playlists created offline can result in several numbered playlists of the same name. X-ray lyrics often incorrect. Tracks disappear from unlimited library & playlists - can't get them back unless purchased separately. Change Amazon password removes all downloaded music sometimes."
11412,AmazonMusic,jessica noel,1,0,too many changes in the agreement terms. Trying to force your existing customers to make more purchases to listen to more than one device is sad. once my prime membership is up. Im cutting everything. Not even Apple does this.
11413,AmazonMusic,Charles Honaker,3,4,I don't think the unlimited is worth the money. I have very fast internet and the music still cuts out. The download feature sucks because it likes to dump all of your music about every three months. I would just stick with the free music that choosing with the membership. The most annoying issue is the remix of classic songs. If you listen to anything pre 90s expect a bad remix.
11414,AmazonMusic,David Morgan,5,0,love this app. seen people say it doesn't work for them... I believe they're problem would be the device they're trying to run this app on. Amazon music has work 4 outta the 5 phones I've installed it on... the 1 it didn't was trash and nothing worked in it.
11415,AmazonMusic,Abhilash M,3,1,Glitch or bad app. The songs in the offline playlist will have a continous flow upto 2 or max 3 songs after that would need to again go to the app and replay. If a glitch please fix if not i better switch to some other music app.
11416,AmazonMusic,Venheighmer Archives,1,0,"If you own music and then get unlimited, which proceeds to lapse or get cancelled, you can no longer listen to music you own if it was up in the catalog. If I had known, I would have never gone unlimited. Screw you Amazon."
11417,AmazonMusic,A Google user,1,11,"1 star is for the App, which is poor. Most annoying thing is when playlists are duplicated in offline mode then when in online mode some songs are then missing. The three dots on songs are too small and when you click to say add to a playlist it plays the song instead. There is no option on songlist currently playing to play next. If i set a playlist to download then any songs added to playlist after shoukd automatically download as well. I have raised these issues many times, but not resolved"
11418,AmazonMusic,Taylor Coffman,2,0,"If you want to do anything with playlists or you want quick access to your music this is not the app for you. It is however almost as good as pandora for its stations. I have a huge gripe still with doing playlists on my phone, the add button is right next to the slider."
11419,AmazonMusic,Cindy Lundberg,4,0,"Like the app. However, as a prime member (paying a premium annual membership) members should get unlimited access to music. There are a lot of ""free"" music apps out there now that you pay absolutely nothing for. Something Amazon really needs to look into."
11420,AmazonMusic,A Google user,3,0,The reason i gave it a 3 is bcoz of The missing of Lyrics Feature which is available on a free music app called gaana. A premium music shall be better. And I cant mention all of them but i suggest you take notes from other similar apps and add those missing features. The Prime and Shopping apps are both 5 Stars apps. but this one needs a lot of Development.
11421,AmazonMusic,Alan Hodgkinson,1,10,"having to log in every time app is opened,and all offline music has to be downloaded every time, customer services have asked for the same information 3 times, and still no solution,told Ide be contacted, still waiting,, total joke."
11422,AmazonMusic,Crystal Littlewood,1,12,the app keeps having issues. any time my phone display turns off and I turn it back on it quits and asks to restart the app. I honestly like pandora better. don't want to pay for spotify or I'd go there.
11423,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,1,"i just downloaded the app and i love it only thing is i wish there where more recondmations on underground hip hop/new songs i could play or mybee i havnt found them not to sure but well be back after a week of useing it,but i do recomend getting this."
11424,AmazonMusic,Travis Chesser,5,0,"Great variety and quality selection. I am truly amazed at all the different genres. Well done Amazon Music. My hat goes off to you. Some songs will display the lyrics as it plays, really enjoy singing along like karaoke."
11425,AmazonMusic,Denzil Gupta,2,29,"Songs just disappear from your playlist when you add them to your library. Sometimes, it says that the song which was added is not available anymore on Amazon Prime Music. Really sucks."
11426,AmazonMusic,Anna Guerra,1,10,"I've noticed songs stutter a lot through this app, making it hard to enjoy my music. This doesn't happen when I listen to music through the website - just the app. Under recommended songs, I can't listen to certain songs because theyre ""no longer available on my device"" and yet they're still recommended? Additionally, the widget to pause, rewind, etc doesn't work - it just shows the song as being paused."
11427,AmazonMusic,A Google user,1,0,"app has many flaws for android users the app should allow the ability to ignore users personal mp3 files stored in another directory on SD card. also the app should automatically sort track by alphabetically by name in playlists, download list. also not all purchased mp3s are successfully downloaded some have errors and unable to repair 4/8 crash crash crash wont even open"
11428,AmazonMusic,Stephen Atkins,3,0,"Enjoying using & convenient, few issues I've had,some purchased albums lose tracks and if you have 2 albulms of same artist and songs but one is live recording it will not let you play both but automatically overites one with the other. could be operator error or my phone, but it's frustrating. not a huge selection of albulms when browsing for particular music."
11429,AmazonMusic,prannoy tej,3,0,needs improvement. and removing downloaded songs just for album cover update is sacrilege. screw drm... you think i want to run away with your downloaded songs?? keep auto refreshing my songs and delete everything in the playlist i spent time making. alexa is deaf. my time using PRIME music is over and i do not think i will back anytime soon.
11430,AmazonMusic,H. Mob,5,3,"Grow up and add the cast button! I can't have 10 different casting devices because billion dollars worth companies cannot put their differences aside! *** 5 star earned, now let's add the cast button to the prime video!"
11431,AmazonMusic,Cassandra DaSilva-Dimmick,1,0,"Not a user friendly app. Has a very confusing layout. ""Following"" an artist does nothing. I keep coming back to it trying to give it another chance but it is just aggrivating trying to navigate and I would almost rather listen to the ads on spotify than use this app."
11432,AmazonMusic,Ciprian NEDELCU,4,0,"it's a great application, but some problems with Sonos I have my account register to Belgium and to change it ,you have to contact the support team :/ and I was expecting that the recommendations are based on my music and not on my browsing history so that why 4 and not 5 :) in rest it's working fine"
11433,AmazonMusic,A Google user,4,11,"The music is good, play lists pretty good and more current than others, HOWEVER.... The navigation screen to browse is awkward. They keep putting up country stations on my home screen. I have NEVER ONCE chosen a country station, yet I have to navigate through dozens of irrelevant stations to find something of interest. I can't believe with all their data on me, they can't track what I listen to, or better group the musical genres."
11434,AmazonMusic,Eddie Olsen,5,0,"I would like a refund, it was supposed to be a 30 day free trial, how did I get charged for it, when I only got to hear 1 Michael Jackson song 2 Cindy Pauper song""s & 1 Journey song & then it just played Cindy over&over -I love Cindy, Amazon don't produce, & that was 4 week's ago, I just got my banks statement ."
11435,AmazonMusic,Francis Ezokas,4,0,"Some of the music selection was pulled off the library after i have been listening to it for quite some time. Either artist, record label, or Amazon's doing, but for the price.... not expecting so many songs to be missing."
11436,AmazonMusic,Emily Crume,3,0,"this is my go to music player and I use it daily but I think its ridiculous that in order for me and my daughter to stream at the same time, Amazon wants me to pay for another Amazon membership for the family music. I already pay for a prime membership....come on...."
11437,AmazonMusic,Paul Deschamps,3,0,lots of choices when it comes to music but it acts like a dang fool constantly crashing when I'm trying to play the next song to hear it to see if I know it when I want to save stuff to my cloud sometimes it won't even play it all and then eventually it crashes. I'm using a Galaxy s9 on Android pie.
11438,AmazonMusic,A Google user,2,0,Song's are limited to my country. A lot of songs (like around million songs) are missing. RIP. Best example this album isn't available in my country... Album Name: Vavavoom Artist: Bassnectar But it's available for my friends from other courtiers. Big RIP ....
11439,AmazonMusic,softstyler,1,5,"Poor functionality, if you have a double album or anthology it will play the songs in the wrong order. Its not easy to use the player offline and it often doesn't work if you can't get wifi or network coverage. If you purchase songs from Amazon the Amazon player is the only one you can use to listen to your songs. I'm very disappointed in it and will be going back to buying physical cds instead."
11440,AmazonMusic,Scott Bell,2,0,"periodically, including currently, the app fails to upload songs i buy to my phone. So i no longer buy music from them cause it just dissappears... I prefer to purchase songs rather than just dowload and listen to them on prime but they have robbed me more times than i can count."
11441,AmazonMusic,Pranjal Gautam,4,2,the app interface is good but it has limited library of hindi music. the search result also not that good as often I can't find my song from it's title then i have to search from album name. please add suggestions in search box.
11442,AmazonMusic,A Google user,1,3,"The app was working perfectly fine before the recent update, but now I can't seem find my playlists in ""My Music."" Kindly request the amazon team to please fix the issue at the earliest."
11443,AmazonMusic,Yesenia Navarro,4,1,love the variety and how it allows you to customize it. the only thing I don't like is how it completely stops the app if you pause and then try to play it again. this mostly happens with my headphones.
11444,AmazonMusic,Peter Schoenster,2,1,for some reason it often takes 30 or more seconds to load and that is irritating when you just want to play your music. most likely its sending some data to a slow website. otherwise it plays music but doesn't have the selection of SoundCloud
11445,AmazonMusic,subramanian karthik,4,0,"There are multiple bugs needs fixing, from Sometimes few downloaded songs don't play unless there is internet and sometimes, the cover picture of the song does not show up. But the support peeps out there is not ready to reproduce them and fix. Everthing else, Good collection of muisc, genuine, nice audio quality."
11446,AmazonMusic,taylorplayer50,3,0,"on the desktop app, page with my plalist icon squares. please remove the option to ""remove from my music"". I accidentally hit it, it removed my playlist, I could not recover it. very frustrating, I had a lot of time invested in making the playlist."
11447,AmazonMusic,Lance Martin,1,0,Sometimes fails to play downloaded music when not connected to the internet. Tends to happen at the worst times. Like in the middle of the night at a remote cabin when I want to put lullabies on to sooth a crying baby. Or when I'm on an airplane and ready to relax with some music.
11448,AmazonMusic,Patrick Weber,3,0,"I like this app, but it goes brain-dead with Android Auto, which is where I would use it most. No artist, genre, playlists (except ""recent"", and then not all the recently played lists). I really hope this gets fixed in future updates."
11449,AmazonMusic,Dave Charnock,1,1,"Keeps trying to trick me into buying things I don't want. App just gave me a fullscreen advert AND asked me to rate it before allowing me to listen to my own music, so here's the rating: 1 star"
11450,AmazonMusic,Royston Lobo,2,0,"i love the music you have. ... but i would love love it if you could give my choice of playing radio for the song... like saavan.... if you could dk that, i would rate it 10* eyes closed......... music makes a persons day good or bad... i would hope you do good for my music i choose........ dor example: I am in a mood to listen ti Damien Rice- 9 Crimes,,,,,and a radio of similar songs... thats what i want... similar song functionality.."
11451,AmazonMusic,Thedayofawakening7z,3,11,"3 out of the 5 times I select a song Whether from my tracklist, an artist/album folder or a Playlist, it will automatically not play it and play the first song in my track list. It's been this way since I got the app. It drives me crazy."
11452,AmazonMusic,Avik Ghosh,3,0,"The app is ok, but it keeps crashing on my ASUS ZenFone Max Pro M2. Also there are a lot of Indian Bollywood songs, that I can't find on the app. You definitely need to fix these issues, specially when it's a paid app."
11453,AmazonMusic,Jane Jones,5,0,I enjoy this app immensely! There are very few songs I search for that are not available unless I purchase Amazon Music Unlimited which I'm not interested in doing at this time. This app is a really nice perk for having Amazon prime membership!
11454,AmazonMusic,Walt R,2,0,"works OK with online music but horrible with saved music you own, whether or not it's on Amazon's cloud. Worked an hour on chat with Tech support and no joy. Seems like what they really want is for customers to subscribe to their on line service."
11455,AmazonMusic,Laurie Lindsey,3,0,Used to be a great addition to my amazon prime membership. Now they want me to pay an additional amount for Amazon unlimited music. No thanks. Also many of the options I used to have are now only available on unlimited.
11456,AmazonMusic,Aniketh,5,32,The best app for music! Having a prime subscription makes things even better. The collection of songs is huge. Their desktop app is also good and works well most of the times.
11457,AmazonMusic,Jackson Bare,4,5,"This is a great music app, I have Unlimited Music along with my family and it allows me to listen to just about everything I could ever want. The only thing I really want them to change is the playlist part of the app. It needs more organization options because moving the songs within the playlist is extremely annoying as you add more songs. If they can fix that, I will come back and rate it 5 stars because it is a fantastic app overall."
11458,AmazonMusic,Bryce Curry,5,0,"it doesn't have much new stuff on the free app but I give it 5 * because I make my play lists. Also cuz I listen to music all day some days and iHeart Radio after a couple hours, will play a commercial at least every third song and some of them are 3 minutes long with no skip button."
11459,AmazonMusic,Codeck,3,0,"Interface is alright. There isn't a dedicated personalized page though. And one of the most basic feature VIEWING SONGS VIA ARTIST NAMES is MISSING and its a major blunder in the whole app atleast for me. With Spotify and apple music now existing in India, would like to see Amazon music improving it's personalized algorithm and make some adjustments to its interface. Another nit picky thing is not having podcast available in the app."
11460,AmazonMusic,Eric Maher,3,0,"Very limited basic version. Apparently, paying for Amazon prime isn't enough to get the complete library with this, which is pretty good, though it doesn't beat the obvious competition. At least you can play stuff from your own library, which is good."
11461,AmazonMusic,Karen G Daniels,5,0,I really enjoy listening to Amazon Music on my Tab A and phone! I use this app daily. It's very easy to use and also stores all of my music CD's that I purchase from Amazon so that I can listen to all my favorites and more! Best app ever! Thanks Amazon.
11462,AmazonMusic,wadekuehl,4,1,Very few crashes in the last few months. seems to be more stable than it was initially. Good selection of music with the unlimited upgrade. It's worth the monthly fee. User friendly too.
11463,AmazonMusic,A Google user,3,0,"Quirky, selection pales in comparison with other music aps. Says music is in playlist that isn't there! Says albums are available that are not; some artists only have one album out of MANY, available on Amazon. Needs more than a little work..."
11464,AmazonMusic,Kimberly McClain,4,1,"This is my go-to music app- i left iTunes long ago and haven't looked back. Its incredibly easy to use, doesn't glitch, etc. My only only gripe is that the music available is constantly changing, so you can have a song on a playlist and later realize that particular song isn't available anymore. It's probably still available somewhere on the app, but you have to go find it again."
11465,AmazonMusic,Jo Fleming,5,0,"IF THERE IS A SONG OR AN ARTIST YOU HAVEN'T HEARD FROM FOR A LONG TIME, WELL THIS IS WHERE YOU CAN FIND THEM ! LEE HAZELWOOD CD'S, THEY ARE GREAT, NEXT I AM GOING AFTER THE SMOTHERS BROTHERS, I'LL GET BACK TO YOU IN A WEEK, JUST TO DO A REVIEW UPDATE, YES, I LOVE PRIME !"
11466,AmazonMusic,Robert Franchetti,4,0,"If I am listening to one of my playlists on my phone and skip a few songs it will stop playing, then I have to type my passwords and tell the app I want to continue listening. Other than that annoying problem the app is fine."
11467,AmazonMusic,Amy Savaglio,5,0,"I love using Amazon music that comes with my Amazon Prime membership. it has such a variety of music and artists that I like it's better than the radio because I can have the artist loaded right to my phone, Kindle or any device."
11468,AmazonMusic,Augelique Stone,2,0,"Latest update is aweful. I pay for the service monthly, so to have conatant lags, music completely stop streaming, and unable to load songs is completely disappointing and makes me want to unsubscribe. When is an update coming out to fix these bugs!?!"
11469,AmazonMusic,michelle knaub,5,6,"Amazon Music is awesome! Dont know why I waited so long to take advantage of FREE music streaming. No ads, compatible with my blue tooth. Not using Spotify or You Tube for music anymore. It's the best. One issue is the basic free library needs to be expanded, cant get all my favs, but I am able to get around 85% of the titles I search for."
11470,AmazonMusic,Noelle Badzik,4,0,"Excellent, quality service that you get with prime. It does suck a little however that they keep taking music off of the catalog. And you can only have one person playing music at a time which can be frustrating."
11471,AmazonMusic,rhapunzol2,3,2,"Has all the songs I wanted, but after 4 downloads, I did 3 more and they are not showing up... don't know where they went to & it won't let me re-download. I have a Note8."
11472,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,"I like that I get to choose my songs and build my exact playlist. I used Pandora previously but didnt always like the similar music it chose for me. If I am in the mood for one particular song, with Amazon I can choose it and listen to it exclusivly as much as I want."
11473,AmazonMusic,Eddy C,2,0,"getting an alexa as a present I subscribed to amazon music which means I unfortmunatly have to use this app. the range of available music is great but this app with the amazon brand on it is trash, main reasons is the slow and at times unresonsive ui, it appears to require a high speed connection at all times even for music you have previously downloaded, expect more than this from a big tech brand"
11474,AmazonMusic,Andrew Roberts,4,0,4.5 Stars. Has almost all the music I want to listen to. Love being able to download songs. I have not figured out yet how to make the songs randomize. they always seem to play in roughly the same order. I would also like to weight songs so some play more often than others.
11475,AmazonMusic,A Google user,4,0,"See Amazon You did a great job by providing such services in India in such a low cost.Thanku for that first. Demerits: 1) User Interface- Pls change your user interface . See UI of wynk or Saavn or even of Spotify. ** I am telling you if you change your UI like Spotify with more options and custamizations, You would be best competeter of spotify and Other music streaming services in India. Pls I am great fan of your service.Do something.ðŸ˜€ðŸ‘"
11476,AmazonMusic,Archit Gupta,4,0,"using it for a long time now but i dont like one thing - the interface purple and blue is not a kind of thing people life seeing often either go for full on white or completely dark i request change the navigation part from below it makes the app looks pretty low in quality , apps like Spotify jiosavan have a clean interface , but being a prime subscriber cant get over it , resolve this thing as soon as possible i like the collection of songs but hate the interface i hope u feel me"
11477,AmazonMusic,Kimberly Wright,5,0,I love this app! Music is what gets me from one day to the next. My life and living situation isn't much to look forward to on a daily basis right now. Amazon Music is there for me though. I love being able to search through Amazon Music and find the music I am looking for. Well worth the cost per month.
11478,AmazonMusic,John Ashe,1,0,"I signed up to the Amazon Family plan but none of the 5 accounts were able to play music. After 45 minutes on the phone with the Amazon tec assistance with no success and being asked to put my credit card details onto my teenage kids account, I requested my â‚¬14.99 back with intension of signing up to Spotify!"
11479,AmazonMusic,Justin Handschuh,4,0,"i have used spotify for at least 2 years and have been extremely happy with it, but now iv found that amazon is better in a lot of ways. firstly, the lyrics amazon provides are much better than spotifys. they show just th lyrics and actually keep track with th song. secondly, they have some songs which i couldnt find on spotify at all.sound quapity is better too. thirdly you get 3 whole months to try th app. drawbacks: the interface is kinda jumbled together and cover art is strangely lowquality"
11480,AmazonMusic,A Google user,2,13,"was good but now requires a premium price tag just to get many songs im interested in, and it's not even mostly contemporary music. used to be better, clearly they needed more money because Amazon is struggling to make ends meet."
11481,AmazonMusic,Chelsea Dawn,3,2,"It's okay, you already have to pay for Prime, to access some of the songs you have to pay for a second tier of music membership. A lot of the songs are radio edits as well which is a bummer."
11482,AmazonMusic,Cindy Pierson,5,0,"Great Tunes, I've had Prime for a couple of years, but didnt think about using Prime music, I had been using another streaming provider. This has now replaced it and I'm not paying another subscription!!! YAHOO!!!"
11483,AmazonMusic,A Google user,4,0,I love the app so much I have replaced my default music app with it. Seamless comination of personal and downloaded content in one app. I would give it 5 stars if it included the ability to pull lyrics for personal songs as well as purchased or downloaded.
11484,AmazonMusic,Victoria Guite,4,0,"It's good. I will say it's annoying when there's no way to sync playlists [and music] on different devices. Also, it glitches and won't load quite often. And it took away some songs I already downloaded, wth?"
11485,AmazonMusic,Mark Valenzuela,3,0,"Need to improve user experience and simplicity of interface app. It's a little confusing when navigating between the amazon store to searching a music on the app & when streaming music, and when building your playlist. Some categories of music exist on certain tabs. Need to improve music history."
11486,AmazonMusic,Steven Summers,1,0,"Incredibly weak. Can't show albums by artist. Can't download groups of albums. Making play lists is horribly cumbersome. I could go on, but you merely need to try it to see what I mean. Only plus is it plays the same music collection I uploaded for Alexa."
11487,AmazonMusic,Devin Moon,4,0,"My go-to for music. Love the stations and discovering new stuff, as well as old. I do wish there was a bit more variety when listening to stations. (e.g., pretty much every station I've tried starts repeating songs after 3 or 4 hours.)"
11488,AmazonMusic,CRAZY HORSEPOWER,1,0,I find it to be a unstable program when skipping songs it crashes and reboots.Also while connected to the car there is sometimes up to a 30 sec delay in skipping music and most of the time the end result is a crash reboot.I think in no way it is a good bluetooth player to a bluetooth receiver or to a hard connection to my all three of my cars!!!!Glad it is not something I wrote! have Closed my amazon prime account as this music app and video app stinks.Amazon HATES TRUTH ITS HATE SPEECH TO THEM!
11489,AmazonMusic,Doniesha Davis,3,0,"I love that I can play a song or whole album as many times as I like, but I hate when I go to open the app and it's frozen or when I put a song in my playlist and the next day when I go to listen to it, it's greyed out and unavailable. this happens more times than a little bit. Quite frustrating."
11490,AmazonMusic,John Meiman,5,0,"Very thorough compendium of artists, musical genres, and performances... for the quite reasonable price, it has been able to find & make available 90-95% of what I am seeking, which keeps me from laboriously digging music out of a 50-year, 12,000 recording music library."
11491,AmazonMusic,lakshya bhatia,2,2,"do not use this as the main music application. The songs you download, get removed on their own . you have to re download them again and again. also it does not have many songs."
11492,AmazonMusic,Jeremy Balmos,1,0,This was once a great app now it is just terrible it hangs up all the time especially during train commute where I dont have a steady internet connection takes forever to load and when I download my own music that I uploaded it messes up and just brings down one song from the same album 15 times. This truly has become the most awful product and if it weren't for the free prime music I get from time to time I would never use it and stick to google music or anything else.
11493,AmazonMusic,Lisa Miller,4,0,"I really enjoy the music & like this app; however, for whatever reason, after awhile it stops playing. When I open the app, it says ""you've been away for awhile, do you want to keep listening"" when in fact, I've been listening all along (?)"
11494,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,"I am satisfy with the app and the amount paid. The quality of music is awesome ! Plus, new tracks release are avail soon so no waiting. I like the feature to block explicit songs, depending to my manners which is convenient for me. Conclusion, satisfy and awesome ! :)"
11495,AmazonMusic,Diana Nance,1,0,So irritated. Since the update the app randomly stops playing music altogether or skips through the entire song and then stops mid song. This is a new issue and I'm pretty upset because it's worked perfect up til now. FIX IT. Please and thank you.
11496,AmazonMusic,GANESH SANJEEVI,2,3,Using it more than a year. Songs suddenly pauses for less than a second and again starts playing. it's really annoying once you are into the song. otherwise it's amazing.
11497,AmazonMusic,Gary Angus,3,0,"this app my wife told me was included with the payment of the video app, but I'm being charged for it, aswell, it doesn't work 60% of the time when I'm driving in my truck, the music is awesome when it's playing though"
11498,AmazonMusic,A Google user,2,2,Worked fine to begin with until last week when an issue with an update led to my SD card thinking it was full - it wasn't. And today the app decided to un-download everything I'd ever downloaded. Also keeps removing songs from the library. Started off really well but now frustrated and considering other options.
11499,AmazonMusic,jeanette supinski,5,0,Love being able to listen to stations and marking songs thumbs up or down. It's like customizing your own station and not dealing with songs you dislike or commercials. Plus being able to just skip a song is great. Awesome app!
11500,AmazonMusic,Charlie Hill,1,0,This app sucks. Started cutting off my Amazon-purchased downloads before the end of the song. Tried changing settings..no luck. I want my money back for the 90-plus songs that I bought on Amazon.
11501,AmazonMusic,oscar silva,1,2,"stop music, while I'm still listening.. and ask, are you still listening..? .. no, I was listening but no more .. ! if I want to turn it off I can do that ."
11502,AmazonMusic,lokesh mavale,4,2,"Fix one bug pplz: Aftr I have downloaded a song, when I go to options and click on go to album.. then ita doesnt show full album. App only shows downloaded songs even in online mode. This was working before now from last to last update its not working.. Thanks!"
11503,AmazonMusic,Joel Penfold,1,0,Don't bother Without unlimited - is now utterly useless.... Recently they made a money-grabbing and tasteless decision to remove some of the music you could listen to without unlimited and force you to pay even more money for a let's be honest below average music streaming service. Naff!
11504,AmazonMusic,Ferdinand Wehr,3,0,"Great app, BUT lacking in minor aspects is disappointing. Pros: great selection of Music, X-ray lyrics is a feature I love, bought Music gets added, saving albums titles, playlists, making playists general features navigation and responsiveness as well as great audio quality....all great. BUT!! Cons: Severe lack of playlists, Top-Tracks for individual artists having the same track in several remixes... poorly 'assembled' playists make it difficult to find/explore new artist and generes"
11505,AmazonMusic,Marcus Gish,4,0,"Thoroughly enjoy using this music app, however there seem to be quite a few glitches and crashes which is my only real complaint about the app, having used it for a couple years now. A 3-4 band parametric EQ would be nice in some future release."
11506,AmazonMusic,Zachary North,3,2,"Biggest issue is with trying to add stuff to my playlists. Sometimes my playlists arent listed when I hit ""add to playlist"". Also just added a whole bunch of songs to my ""Rock"" playlist and apparently that playlist simply doesn't exist despite having added 20 songs to it just now. Generally the app isnt easy to navigate. Got a long way to go to compete with Apple music and Spotify."
11507,AmazonMusic,A Google user,2,1,"I have a Pixel 2XL running Pie with latest security updates. As of a few months ago, song information is no longer displayed on my car's head unit over Bluetooth. Google Play Music app works just fine."
11508,AmazonMusic,Chance N.,4,0,"i love this app, its honestly the best music streaming app you can get but i cant give it 5 star for one major issue, i have 10's of thousands of songs in my library(thats a lot) and occasionally music will just be removed from the catalog without actually telling me so once i.find out that a song is gone i gotta spend an.hour seeing what all is missing, fix this issue somehow by like giving me notification of the.removal and its an undisputed 5 star"
11509,AmazonMusic,Erin Griffiths,5,0,"THERE IS NOTHING IN THE WORLD LIKE AMAZON!!! WHEN AMAZON WAS CREATED IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE AS GREAT AS THE COMPANYS NAMESAKE AND ABLE TO REACH EVERYWHERE, JUST LIKE THE LONGEST RIVER IN THE WORLD...THE AMAZON RIVER. AMAZON IS AN AMAZING COMPANY, WITH AMAZING MUSIC CHOICES & SOUND, WITH AMAZING SHOPPING CHOICES, AND AMAZING REPRESENTATIVES, I JUST LOVE AMAZON BECAUSE IT IS AMAZING EVERYTHING..... BECAUSE IT IS THE GREAT AND AMAZING AMAZON!!!!!"
11510,AmazonMusic,Cyndi Pitts,5,0,I hate Apple! Amazon music is so much easier and better. The songs are cheaper and there is more variety. The monthly or yearly charge is worth it. I can add a song to my library with one click on my phone. I don't even have to add the song to my library to listen to it if I don't want to.
11511,AmazonMusic,sai srinath,3,0,The music is good The only development i would like to see is regarding Downloads when your device is signed out once all your downloads will vanish from your device. And you need to start from zero again. this is a very serious problem & i hope that amazon will fix it soon. ðŸ™
11512,AmazonMusic,Paula Henson,1,0,It would be nice if when a song is only available through unlimited or to buy you could get the option to buy without that unlimited nag screen. We KNOW you offer unlimited you don't have to nag us incessantly about it. And there still isn't an exit feature.
11513,AmazonMusic,Steve Fontaine,3,0,"Used to be better. There are too many ads/pop ups when you first open the app, they are taking away music that I used to have downloaded, and pushing their subscription service. I'd rather just buy the MP3 once than pay yet another subscription."
11514,AmazonMusic,javita gary,4,1,I would give it five star if the app didn't send me to Google Play EVERY TIME to open it. Other than that it works just great. I don't need my Fire to play my music. Love it.
11515,AmazonMusic,Selina Waitekus,1,6,it keep stop in the middle of the song. Than it kicks me out of the app. it's getting really annoying. if I could put no stars I would have done that instead.
11516,AmazonMusic,Dub,4,0,"Good app when you have good connectivity, although the ""back"" functionality is confusing and you have to manually open the app (not though the notification) to change artist/album. With poor connectivity, it sometimes fails to load offline songs."
11517,AmazonMusic,Christopher Kamm,5,0,"I love this service especially with the family plan, separate playlists for everyone. I find this app library on par with google play music for my listening needs. It's great and I rarely listen the radio in my car any more."
11518,AmazonMusic,Jody Roy,4,0,"Nice, albeit limited, selection of tunes. App is easy to use. I load music to my playlist on my pc, and listen on my phone while out. Feel it should be included in the Amazon Prime member's package."
11519,AmazonMusic,Anna C,2,0,Not very intuative. Has a lot of issues knowing music was downloaded to my device so I have to stream online music more thab I'd like. You will get ads constantly to switch to music unlimited. Look for other options if you have them.
11520,AmazonMusic,PSax,2,1,"I used to love this app and rated it high.  Lately, however, I cannot get my PURCHASED music to download to my phone (Galaxy S 8+).  Amazon had no problem charging me."
11521,AmazonMusic,A Google user,2,0,"especially with rap artists,they don't sort through it so everything is just mixed together.i will look up an artist,see that they have a bunch of cds/songs on there i didn't know about,then it is some completely different type of music from a completely different artist"
11522,AmazonMusic,John B,2,0,"I switched from amazon unlimited to amazon prime for added benefits of free shipping, but amazon music sucks. very limited selection. I lost all my songs on my playlists because they weren't available anymore. if you're looking for music, save your money."
11523,AmazonMusic,Bridget Michelle Higgenbotham,5,0,"I absolutely love Amazon Music, especially the Alexa feature. I can listen to music all day and night without interruptions. I use Amazon music during my workouts, while I am taking my midday walks, and during my time of worship and praise."
11524,AmazonMusic,im ho,2,1,"it is cluttered and confusing. only the color palette is nice. hard to figure out how to queue songs , where songs live , etc. A poor result from the worlds richest man."
11525,AmazonMusic,Elizabeth Donlon,5,1,"I love it.. only draw back is you have to pay for premium in order to get certain songs, which I think is ridiculous. but all in all, GREAT app, great music, great selection"
11526,AmazonMusic,Simon K,2,0,"More often than not when I try to open an album I've searched for, the app just hangs with the blue circle going around and around.......Clearing the cache or closing and reopening the app does not help. Please fix or I'll have to look elsewhere."
11527,AmazonMusic,Michael Napoleoni,5,0,"Great for listening to music dowloaded from Amazon or streamed with Prime. Most albums I like I usually can stream with my Prime membership. However, I believe in supporting artists by purchasing their albums, or if I want to listen offline I can download pirchased albums. Nice UI and works great."
11528,AmazonMusic,Jane T,5,1,"This is a pretty good app and I do love it . It's a bit slow to open when your in a place that doesn't have a lot of signal, but you can listen to your download music very clearly. So yeah it's a pretty good app."
11529,AmazonMusic,Gary Penn,4,0,"Great music app, has something for all my family, allows me to download and create playlists for all events. The only reason I havent given amazon music 5 stars is simply because its always good to continue improving and striving for better. Great work so far guys!"
11530,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,I live by this app! The only change I would make is to make the sleep timer longer like1- 2 or 3 hours .. give us options.. not everyone falls asleep right away... otherwise it's a perfect app especially if you are getting their subscription which I highly recommend....
11531,AmazonMusic,Cliff Hurd,5,0,"I switched from Pandora to Amazon music, I'm not only saving money but I'm safer on the road with a simple ""Hey Alexa"" I can call upon the 30 million plus songs they have on there. I will not be switching back unless they do something stupid."
11532,AmazonMusic,Jenny Crank,4,13,"glad to see update and connect to echo need updated kids play lists... they want to try new things often, not so many lullabies. haha. i would like to see more suggestions for new music i might like. Stations are great but so often they play the same songs repetitively. Love it over all and love that the app works so much easier with echo now."
11533,AmazonMusic,Erin Traxler,2,2,"at first, things seem great. then my music just gets ""removed from the catalog"". this is quite frustrating, especially when you have prime, AND pay for the unlimited music service. selection is still okay, but when my stuff disappears... well that's not unlimited, Amazon. ðŸ˜ "
11534,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,"This app is phenomenally easy to use once you get Alexa involved it's so simple for someone,such as myself, to use that has issues typing on the phone. This app works tremendously well. I'd highly recommend it"
11535,AmazonMusic,Tampa Mabins,1,2,I've used Amazon music for years but continue to have the same issue with unavailable music after it's been purchased! tired of receiving error codes. please fix!!
11536,AmazonMusic,sumanth sunny,4,0,Amazon Music app experience is increasing day by day. In the initial days i couldn't not able to find popular tracks in Amazon music. Now it has wast library of music.Moreover I am part of amazon echosystem with prime video and kindle .Now music is added into one more daily usage amazon app.Still there is lot to improve
11537,AmazonMusic,Nick Hubbert,5,0,"This a one of the best music apps around. Of course, you have to pay for the service to experience it's full quality. But it's SOOOOOO good. If you at least want a month of pure bliss, sign up for the trial!"
11538,AmazonMusic,Bobbi Eide,5,0,"I haven't had a tv for months, so listening to this fine music is a wonderful way for me to de-stress my evening. Thank you all tbis wonderful music. And as an Amazon Prime member it's free. Thanks again Amazon!"
11539,AmazonMusic,Gary Reno,5,0,"the only way Amazon music could be any better is, if it was just a little cheaper per month, and if it played videos with the music that you can find on this wonderful wonderful Amazon app!!!!! thank you, and think about it, you can do it!!!!! after all you are Amazon you can do anything."
11540,AmazonMusic,Ryan Kelley,3,0,"Good playback quality and no commercials is big plus! limited selection, and incredibly annoying that some albums just become unavailable. Also glitchy when adding songs to playlists, as at times won't do it because it thinks an album is already there."
11541,AmazonMusic,Chris Owen,5,0,"I love this music app I've had Deezer & iTunes but this app is like the best of both of them. I can buy music, save music to play when I'm off line or just stream music. I would highly recommend this app."
11542,AmazonMusic,*lost girl*,5,0,"Great app overall! I did not have any problems, and the music is free! If you want diffrent songs from youtube as well, then they probably have them. All you need is your email adress and password."
11543,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,"This service has improved my quality of life ðŸ˜€. By using ""My Station"" I have been introduced to dozens of artists that I never would have heard! I share them with my family and get all kids of "" street cred"" from my teenage boys ðŸ‘. Can't live without it."
11544,AmazonMusic,Mike Georgiou,5,0,"Intuative and not complicated to use. Sure there are loads of options, but they dont get in the way of what should be the main function of any music player. Very easy to find the music you want, manage and store the music you like, and to listen to that music, where and when you wish."
11545,AmazonMusic,Gems88 x,1,0,"Retards in many places... Glitches glitches less variety, less options, no podcasts. many songs are been deleted or aren't available.. doesn't matches to Spotify or even Ganaa your prime video isn't compared to Netflix. work more make it better, competitive, best etc. heyy Amazon put similar song option in it please..... update.....i like it also please respond thankyou."
11546,AmazonMusic,Jonathan Mohn,3,0,"overall it is a good app. the free music selection is pretty nice. however, the app has some significant reliability issues. there are many times the app must be restarted to show the library. it also doesn't handle non-amazon files well."
11547,AmazonMusic,Curtis Mattingly,3,1,"It's a decent app, but I miss some features like a random shuffle of artists and songs similar to Pandora. Not very user friendly. Seems slow too, especially when 1st opening."
11548,AmazonMusic,Marcus Edward,4,0,"Being able to recall, search for, and then listen again to the music I enjoyed when I was younger is a priceless tool to have. This, as well as the vast library of music, lends itself to the discovery of 'new' music old and unheard, as well."
11549,AmazonMusic,Hope Whispers,5,0,"The Music Unlimited experience supplies all my global tastes. My delights begin with Arabic and Syrian verses dancing as they sing. Then, in the afternoon, Celtic lullabies flute and flit my baby boy into deep sleep from their Healing Center! I am never disappointed and am now a forever fan. Thank you, Amazon."
11550,AmazonMusic,Tony Quinn,3,0,"It takes a little while to figure the UI out, but it's not too hard to use. pretty wide selection of tracks, but I've stumped it a few times. it sucks to be an Amazon Prime paying member, and then still have to pay extra to download anything on it."
11551,AmazonMusic,jeff parkinson,3,0,Won't get more than 3 stars And I suggest you all do the same UNTIL it becomes compatible with All Google tvs etc.... And vice versa your only hurting the consumer here.... Got a Sony Smart TV that WONT Play my Amazon music what the hell use is that...... So had to sign up for Spotify as well.... Whilst still asking me to sign up for Unlimited (not likely until I can play my music on All of my devices) Sort it out you two pathetic creatures...
11552,AmazonMusic,SANDRA REYES DONOSO,4,0,"I wish that they dont block too much music because you dont have the unlimited plan , we already paid a annual plan to Amazon .will be great that they can be more flexible about it . But for the other side it's a nice app and I love the way that work"
11553,AmazonMusic,Isaiah Ramos,5,0,"I like the ability to create my own playlists. I also enjoy the lack of ads. I still wish there was some way to rate the music, even with a thumbs up or down so I can see how I rated songs in the past. Star ratings would be better. Still a great music app."
11554,AmazonMusic,Jo Hester,5,0,Love amazon music. i have unlimited but that means 6 of us can have an account and download to whatever device and listen offline. i have no problem finding music and obscure music. never a problem with buffeting or dowmloads the only downside is that someyimes u find artists take off their music which is understandable.
11555,AmazonMusic,Patricia Lewis,5,2,it is super amazing!the thing that I love about it is it has all the songs and I love k pop and all the other music apps don't really have k pop but Amazon music does and the quality is over my head #love it!
11556,AmazonMusic,Robyn Boedigheimer,5,3,"there has yet to be a song I can't find! its AW3SOME! I have the unlimited add on so I can always get new music when it comes out. It's definitely worth the extra couple bucks. A huge benefit is not having to store all my music on my phone, in case you switch phones or don't want to bog your phone down with hella music files. User friendly interface, player widget for the home screen (yas), and can't forget about Alexa! while the app is up she works good! nice to have in the car! overall great!"
11557,AmazonMusic,Martita Cabrera,1,1,"I loved this app at first, but now music keeps randomly stopping or the app crashes. what's the point of having this app if I can't listen to music."
11558,AmazonMusic,charleywhaley,1,0,Has worked perfectly until yesterday. The audio sounds tinny and really low; I thought my headphones were playing up originally but then I listened to YouTube and my music files on my phone and they work perfect. App needs to fix this bug!
11559,AmazonMusic,Ann H,1,1,"Frustrating AF! I've signed up with the ""Amazon unlimited"" plan and it plays fine using voice commands with the echo device, but when i want to play music from my Alexa app in my phone, to the echo device, every song is grayed out and if i press play, i get prompted to ""upgrade to play music on all of my devices"". i only have 1 device! Then when i click ""no thanks"", my songs are still grayed out! I can't figure it out. how to play music from the Alexa app? I've emailed support. they don't help."
11560,AmazonMusic,Gilbert Medina,4,0,"Nice Work Amazon but... would be five but when you think of a song from back in the day, and it turns out they don't have it, it kinda hurts no lie hahaha. but overall nicely put together Amazon. Slow clap."
11561,AmazonMusic,Peter Clark,3,0,"Works good most of the time. Has issues playing music from time to time, pauses sometimes mid-song on downloaded music. Switching phone to airplane mode fixes this. Works well with bluetooth devices - car stereo, headphones, etc."
11562,AmazonMusic,Marie Beckett,2,0,"I get great service when I'm at home or around WiFi. But when I'm in my vehicle, I need to use 4LTE on my smartphone and I barely get any service. What I don't like is I pay yearly for Amazon Prime but need to pay extra to get Unlimited Music on this app, which I refuse to do."
11563,AmazonMusic,Pete Ybanez,5,0,Great app! It can be tailored to one's likes and dislikes. Should you only desire music then that is all you'll get. If you should wish other internet based options then you'll get those as well. You control the amount of content one receives.
11564,AmazonMusic,Jon Page,5,6,"Love Amazon music. Can not think of a time I did not find what I was looking for. Its stable, user friendly and well stocked. I wish it synced with the Google assistant so I could play tunes handsfree though with out having to unlock the phone andstart the app first. Only complaint. 5 Stars"
11565,AmazonMusic,A Google user,2,2,"Requires Forced Closingâ€¦ a Lot! S8 Whenever I come back to this app, it often won't even show anything other than the bottom banner and the same song as before. Above that it won't show you anything other than the spinning circle of doing nothing. Once force closed and then reopened, I can access my music within a second. The other super annoying thing is that the app loaded my ringtones into the lists but does not give any options to remove my ringtones from the list but not the device"
11566,AmazonMusic,Curtis Arnold,2,1,I previously left a good review but now I am unhappy with a few things. they are trying to tell me I can not listen to MY music that I have downloaded to my phone because I do not have their music unlimited and its constantly being slow or not loading at all even when I have perfectly good service. I'm not paying for your stupid unlimited plan when your app is sub par.
11567,AmazonMusic,Randell Wren,3,0,"music app was the reason i subscribed to prime, as I didn't order a bunch of stuff on Amazon . Stopped using Slacker for music an was great. but not your charging for monthly subscription an reduced my play list. dropped you to 3 stars , if you would have left it alone would have been 4 or 5"
11568,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,5,"I've used Amazon music for a some time now and the entire experience has been nothing short of amazing. I'm an electrical engineer with some technical acumen but the speed at which content can be made available, and I hate to say this almost shames the big boys. Oh but I forgot - there is a brand new big set of balls in town! Take note."
11569,AmazonMusic,Bryan Mestas,3,1,Mostly good. They give a lot of music for the regular subscription but hoard a lot of good old music and new popular music to get you to buy the upgrade for unlimited which is significantly more money. Also it pisses me off when I'm driving or lifting weights and it stops the music to ask if I'm still listening. If they could change it to where the music continues playing or the app recognizes I'm using another device to change the songs or lets it go for 24 hours before asking!
11570,AmazonMusic,Bradley Sorensen,2,6,"When it works, it works great. Before it gets to that point, slow loading of music, searching for music is slow, all on and off wi-fi. It is even painfully slow at loading the music that is already downloaded. Overall, worst music player I have ever used and just not worth paying for. Expected a lot more from a big company like this."
11571,AmazonMusic,John Hoerst,1,0,"A great big tease! Nothing but error messages for songs that can't be played. Slow and usually useless fixes. A headache when you uninstall it as a fix, you need to download your music again. STAY AWAY!"
11572,AmazonMusic,A Google user,1,2,"From last couple of times in a week's time, my app has restarted and all the songs added to My Music has disappeared. I downloaded few of them and added them to My Music few days back but just now when I launched the app, the welcom screen came and all my downloads are gone. This needs to be fixed."
11573,AmazonMusic,Lukas Burke,1,0,"it's pretty terrible... constantly stops working, no good way to save or organize the music you like, buttons are slow and unresponsive, plus dozens of other little inconvenient quirks... plus they are constantly throwing up full screen adds for the upgraded version"
11574,AmazonMusic,Christine Winter,5,0,Easy to use and works flawlessly. I am very impressed with this music app and with Alexa it's even better. never had a problem at all so far and been using it for more than 10 months. Great service with Amazon Prine!
11575,AmazonMusic,Jeff Dickerson,5,0,"Amazon Music is great! How ever when selecting a song to put on your playlist, I'm having difficulty how to do this. On Spotify it waws so much easier,because it would do it for you. Your welcome to contact me"
11576,AmazonMusic,Andrew Shinn,5,0,besides the fact im running an amazon app on an outdated android tablet this app works exceptionally well! i love being able to use Alexa to control the app so i dont have to put down my game controller! lol! everyone who worked on developing this deserves big kudos!
11577,AmazonMusic,Alice Araujo,4,0,"The only thing I don't like is that you see my choice in music, which is Christian, & your recommendation pop ups are secular. If you know what your customer likes, then keep your customer happy."
11578,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,love it and enjoy this app daily!! i have had a paid subscription for almost a year and I'm pleased with it. if it crashes i close it and open it right back up and it's good. 5â˜…amazon!!
11579,AmazonMusic,Billy Mooney,3,1,most of the new alternative i like I can't download or purchase unless I buy prime music. im already forking over $129/yr for Amazon prime. the music should just be free at that point. nickels and dimes y'all.
11580,AmazonMusic,Asheesh singhwal,1,7,"it was working fine but with the last and latest update, it is not a pleasant experience anymore. The music control stops working when you try to change or pause the music and I find it extremely inconvenient when I have to draw a compex, crossing-over pattern yo unlock phone everytime. Alexa is fine but I don't want to use that everytime. Please work on this as the app is not that bad."
11581,AmazonMusic,omkar gharat,5,0,The best music app ever! Ofcourse it is completely paid and not at all free! But it comes in the advantage of an amazon prime account so no ads! Large collection of all genres and types of music! Would highly suggest if you have an amazon prime membership!!
11582,AmazonMusic,ALBERT J W,5,0,"YOU KNOW THE FEELING. YOU'VE GOT A TUNE STUCK IN YOUR HEAD. YOU LOVE THE TRACK JUST NOT GOING ROUND YA HEAD ALL DAY. AMAZON MUSIC HAS THE ANSWER. ASK ALEXA FROM YOUR ECHO OR YOUR ALEXA APP & BINGO. TRACK PLAYED, ENJOYED & A CLEAR HEAD OR LISTEN TO THAT TRACK YOU'VE NOT HEARD IN YEARS OR THE ONE YOUR MUM AND DAD USED TO LOVE. ALL YOUR FAVES IN ONE PLACE. NO HESITATION 5/5"
11583,AmazonMusic,Spoopy Skeleton,1,11,im apart of a family plan and have been for over a year. every week i have to get the owner to reconfirm im apart of the plan or i cant even access my songs. Its extremely annoying seeing as its a waste of everyones time and i ofter have to drive in the mornings with no music ruining my morning.
11584,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,2,has a good variety of music with a menu that is easy to navigate.. only downfall is that it doesn't quite have my taste in music synced up with the AI so I get random songs here and there that have no interest to me.
11585,AmazonMusic,The Ross,2,1,"There are still glitches that cause songs to be repeatedly placed in a playlist two to four times. Also, some songs are not played if chosen and others will not be deleted."
11586,AmazonMusic,Ry Keener,3,0,"Even with all the songs available, the app is still cluncky and difficult to use sometimes. It only works with Alexa sometimes, but even then, I still need manually use my phone for some songs. The app has a lot of room to grow."
11587,AmazonMusic,JASON STYLES,1,0,"very bad....all i know is ITUNES dont charge you to listen of clips of music, amazon wants to rape you for every dollar, why? this app is the worst music app i ever used.if you think you can browse music and get a listen before you buy like itunes your wrong! the app opens and as sokn as you click it takes you to a purchase page! garbage ill stick to itunes and youtube."
11588,AmazonMusic,Mohit Singh,1,0,"worst app from Amazon. It crashes a lot. You can only play songs online. If you try to play songs from downloaded library, the app will crash. Amazon need to fix this issue. And they are not replying to customer support also."
11589,AmazonMusic,Julie Sanders,5,0,"Absolutely LOVE IT!!!! My daughter & I will simply give you 3 ok maybe (4) words ""why"" we LOVE The Amazon Music App!!! It's as simple as ""WHY DON'T WE"" (Music) You all have, I believe, all of their songs!! Great Job!!! A++++!!!!"
11590,AmazonMusic,Sachin Javsen,4,0,Nice collection of songs from 60's to till date. Give 4 star for collection of songs as app is for music. 1 star less no so intuitive user interface. It needs constant network connection to load basic interface ab initio. It is expected when I want to listen downloaded songs.
11591,AmazonMusic,Tiffany Harris,1,0,Amazon membership claims you get access to millions of songs. NOPE! You must pay extra for this!!! I love having my music so I paid anyway. After next month I'm going back to Youtube and its ads. IDGAF about Amazon anymore. Disappointed.
11592,AmazonMusic,Andy Pachla,2,0,"I wish i could play music in my car without the thing randomly stopping to say ""are you still listening?"" or ""wouldn't you like to give us more money for our unlimited service that we used to give you with what you're already paying for?"""
11593,AmazonMusic,Abhijith S,2,2,"Great Content, Useless Player. Really wish if the streaming quality was 320 kbps and the app provided an equalizer. Current audio quality is not anything worth mentioning. FM radio songa hav better quality"
11594,AmazonMusic,Marc Mccown,2,2,"music stops playing often when on cellular data, 2-4 times per song. usually comes on again when i turn on the display of my phone.no other audio apps on my phone have this problem."
11595,AmazonMusic,Lokesh Daga,4,2,The app is good and pretty handy. Easy to use ans create playlists. The only proboem I am facing is the screen flickering when I open the app. It makes an top to bottom flicker as it opens up. I think its a glitch with this app as this is happening with this only. No other app is giving such flicker while opening.
11596,AmazonMusic,Mike Feltman,3,0,More and more of the music i like is moving to their premium service. I tend to use Pandora or Slacker more now. This is sad that they have become so hungry. Prime music for another fee! I don't think so!
11597,AmazonMusic,Cathy H,5,0,"I love this app. It always has the new stuff (and almost all the old stuff) I want. I just wish more of a discount was offered with a year subscription, especially when you're already an Amazon Prime member."
11598,AmazonMusic,Kyla Wonsewith,4,0,i love the app.....i strongly dislike that if a song isnt downloaded or added to a specific playlist it may disappear and be gone. You then have to buy it! other than bigger variety. ...i love my music from early 2000s on back.....I cant find some
11599,AmazonMusic,Sergiy Nazarenko,3,0,the shuffle functionality of this app is lackluster to say the least. my sony discman could shuffles songs more randomly than this sad excuse for an mp3 player. also playlist management is a vit clunky. on the other hand they have a lot of music so theres that...
11600,AmazonMusic,Carlos Salinas,5,0,"Amazon Music app is awesome, I found all my favorites songs from the 70's, 80's and 90's. The app is very easy to use, you can create your own playlists or you can download playlists related to your interests. Excellent work!"
11601,AmazonMusic,Alex Fett,1,0,"""Free"" my ass. All of the music I could want to listen to is restricted unless I get an Amazon Unlimited subscription. Screw paying that 8$, I'll keep that and just listen to everything on youtube like a sane person."
11602,AmazonMusic,Alex Marial,1,1,"this app crashes and deletes all my music constantly because it logs me out. it tries to log me in with my other prime account, which I don't use for music. but I'm stuck using this because I've given it all my money. yay technological hostage situation."
11603,AmazonMusic,Lady Zenobia,5,1,"Why not use it, I've been a Prime member for such a long time, I thought to myself. So, I cut my Spotify membership and don't regret it, at all. And, Alexa is the cherry on top!"
11604,AmazonMusic,Chance S.,3,1,The app useto work great but recently it will stop playing in the middle of a song. The app is up to date. Very frustrating while driving. I hope the issue is solved soon.
11605,AmazonMusic,Kevin Muthima,5,11,"A thousand times better than spotify in terms of ability to play downloaded music offline. Intuitive user interface. only complaint is a number of artists keep removing and then re-adding some of their albums on here. Most importantly are Frank Oceans mixtapes, like Nostalgia Ultra, which is currently unavailable (Feb 2019), and it's a shame because that mixtape is worth like 3 Grammys, TRUST ME, go listen (elsewhere)."
11606,AmazonMusic,Greg Pita,5,0,"I have Pandora+, but Amazon Music blows it away ! I Love the song choices, the stations and how easy it is to navigate through the list. Amazon Music is my new go-to at the gym, in my car and when I'm heading out for a run."
11607,AmazonMusic,A Google user,4,3,"Some songs, their quality isn't as good, some play louder than others on my devices...I like all my music loud. On the positive side, I love the ease of finding a wide variety of music and that most songs can be found with lyrics. I like the visual layout of the app."
11608,AmazonMusic,John Higgins,2,0,It used to be considerably better but when they came out with their premium service they started taking all the songs away that were free. now I have all these songs that I had downloaded that no longer work. Extremely disappointing tactics.
11609,AmazonMusic,A Google user,3,0,"Pretty good. Dint find the UI very user friendly. For example, the options (3dots) in front of each track is very small.. End up playing the song erasing the entire Playlist..And sometimes when i add a song to the current Playlist, the song currently playing restarts itself.. These are annoying.."
11610,AmazonMusic,Greg Searle,4,4,"Good music player, good music selection. User interface is powerful, and takes some experimentation to learn, but there are some limits. Bluetooth support is mediocre. Can download Prime music to your device! Automatically finds, indexes, and integrates existing music on your device. Can't find many artists in the store who are available elsewhere (Play Store for example)."
11611,AmazonMusic,Marian Luzzi,5,0,Absolutely the best streaming service! We've been thrilled by everything from stations to playlists to suggestions. I've had Pandora and Apple in the past. For me the flexibility combined with multiple ways to both access and view music puts Amazon above the rest.
11612,AmazonMusic,Jordan Groce-allen,4,0,"Doesn't have everything, but almost everything. Not a lot of underground artists but that's my personal preference. Has everything main stream though. I use it everyday and when I can't find what I'm looking for I just switch over to YouTube."
11613,AmazonMusic,Sam Ponnudurai,4,0,I first used this app first in iPhone and i really loved the UI. Recetly i moved to Android and its pretty decent here as well. just few suggestions from my side. pls add songs popularity rating just as ios app and also please bring in the Artists firld into the app so that it will be easy to search the songs at artist level in My Music tab.
11614,AmazonMusic,Michael Elliott,3,0,I love this App! I use it all of the time! The problem I have with it is songs keep disappearing off my play list all of the time. they say not available. otherwise I would give this App 4 stars. I upgraded and still have the same problem.
11615,AmazonMusic,MonkeyPlays,5,2,love this app in either subscription mode or free. even free options have great choices. Lyrics great for those who can't hear/understand them but can hear the music.
11616,AmazonMusic,CplTaggart,4,0,"This is a good app overall. there are some glitches, however, such as when making playlists i'll try adding a song and the app won't let me, saying that the song is already in the playlist when it isn't."
11617,AmazonMusic,Martin Brice,1,0,"worked fine at first but now every single track seems to be behind the ""unlimited"" wall, even many I've listened to before. we're in Amazon Prime. would advise using spotify, better range of music and easier to use."
11618,AmazonMusic,crystal knue,3,0,"The music is good, but the app layout is a little confusing & repetitive. So honestly it's not my first choice for music, but I'm also fairly new to the app and haven't been navigating through it for very long."
11619,AmazonMusic,Nick Reyna,5,0,The Amazon Music app is one of the best music apps I have ever downloaded. Super easy to use. Extensive music library. I enjoy using it everyday while at work or jamming out after a few drinks.
11620,AmazonMusic,Ryan Bell,2,0,Caught it transferring a lot of data in the background when I haven't used it on my device for a long time. No permissions provided. I don't like apps that transfer data unnecessarily so uninstalled.
11621,AmazonMusic,Srinivas RG,5,0,My experience is excellent. I only listen to music of golden era of Bollywood which is there. I listen to western music also of all genres . I found Phil Collins also. I am totally satisfied.
11622,AmazonMusic,Soumyajit Das,4,6,Amazon music has come a lot way more forward in the Indian market. the collections are good but still need to catch up further in terms of Hindi and Regional songs ( in my case it is Bengali). Adding songs to a playlist is difficult. Otherwise it is a very good music app.
11623,AmazonMusic,Christie Truong,2,0,"my biggest issue is that it's not easy to navigate. when i set up the widget, i cant access my list of music from my playlist. i cant just go back or click a button, i have to get out of my widget and go find the axtual app and i can finally access it from therr"
11624,AmazonMusic,Martha Yarborough,5,0,I love this app. Safe and hands free driving is very important to me. It saves lives. My daughter is a beginner driver and I worry about her constantly. I believe this app helps her to focus more on driving. Thank you Alexa......
11625,AmazonMusic,Ryan Southard,3,0,"Its a great source for music, but i hate that Amazon removes my downloaded music. So songs I really enjoy they completely remove it from their platform. Not sure if its just me, but it seems the app runs very slow and lags quite a bit."
11626,AmazonMusic,Jay Allen,2,0,Great because Prime music is gratis with my prime subscription. But compared to itunes/play music functionality/ui needs updating but the real killer is the unresponsive ui /stalls when starting music - downloading song/album onto device makes very little difference. Spoken to Amazon support twice now: issues of stalling/long pauses not sorted. Compared to kindle/video apps Amazon don't appear to pur resources into tge app - if I was purely paying for Prime music I would definitely cancel.
11627,AmazonMusic,DomKendar -,2,0,"Decent music selection, but very difficult to delete music once downloaded. Tends to be glitchy as well. numerous bugs that are not resolved by the devs. app will lock up or take up to 10 minutes to respond intermittently."
11628,AmazonMusic,Chris Davies,4,0,"Really easy to use, a really good range of music but only 4 stars instead of 5 because songs get removed from the app which can be a bit annoying. Also sometimes film soundtracks will miss tracks out which a shame. Everything else is really good."
11629,AmazonMusic,Joel Williamson,3,0,This is a good app. I would give it 5 stars but even with a Prime membership you still only get partial access to the music catalog. Amazon wants you to pay more money for a membership inside my Prime membership....Now thats garbage!!!
11630,AmazonMusic,Heidi Webb,3,0,"I love Amazon music overall but I do not like the fact that I pay so much every year to be a prime member and in order to get much of the music I want, Amazon wants me to pay another $10 a month for the privilege of streaming anything. It kind of feels like they are double dipping and i have been considering other options"
11631,AmazonMusic,Ramir Lyles,4,0,"Great app! It even has tagalog music. There are only a few songs that I've search for, that were not available. Also, sometimes when trying to play a song, the app will continue to buffer and will not play. I hope they fix this issue."
11632,AmazonMusic,Daniel Zajic,4,0,"Love the recommendations, and the ease of managing playlists. I wish I could downvote when I don't like a song; not sure how else to disambiguate between not feeling like listening to a song at the time vs never wanting to hear it again."
11633,AmazonMusic,Abhinav Kulshrestha,3,1,"needs work. buttons in Notification shade always shows ""playing"" after pie update. Nobody uses Alexa this much that you should put in all the efforts in that area, rather, invest on fixing the existing issues first."
11634,AmazonMusic,Ritesh Sharma,3,10,Too many improvements required. songs getting paused during playback most of the time. Even Downloaded songs are taking too much time to start playback. Kindly rectify the same. Overall application is good but as per Amazon standard its lacking the aspects to be considered best.
11635,AmazonMusic,Xander Mills,3,0,I don't see why as a Prime Member I should have to pay a further Â£79 to listen to music. a decent selection on the free version just its forever changing and some bands never make it to the free version.
11636,AmazonMusic,Carrie Young,5,0,"Loving amazon music so far, especially like the playlists and, if you've ever bought a cd on the amazon site itself, guess what - that music is automatically added to your amazon music app. What's not to like?"
11637,AmazonMusic,Laura Squitieri,3,0,I like it except for one problem which is pretty annoying. It takes way too long to load. I usually use Pandora and don't have that issue so it's not my phone. Other things about it are better but I probably won't stay because of this.
11638,AmazonMusic,Ice_storm Gamingxxx,1,2,Every time I open the app it says Amazon Music has stopped working it needs to be fixed even after I updated it it still stopped working!!!!!!
11639,AmazonMusic,Jessica Haberle,5,0,"I use the app to create set lists for my group fitness class. I love that I can play purchased music, along with silence tracks (breaks) I made myself. Super helpful! Also, adding to and editing playlists is easy and intuitive."
11640,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,I've had Amazon Music for some time and am quite satisfied so far. Songs will be removed from your playlist as I assume they are no longer available. Also you will need Wifi or data to listen to music even when your songs are downloaded.
11641,AmazonMusic,Melissa Didericksen,5,0,Enjoying! Amazon music app! One if the things that surprised me about this app is that it is very comparable to my other music app. I didn't expect it to be as useful as it has. Useful to switch from my lists to the unlimited music.
11642,AmazonMusic,Craig,5,0,"I've had itunes, Pandora and Spotify subscriptions....Amazon Music is THE best! Playlists are easy to create. Music is easy to find. Stations are jam packed with the best music of each genre and type. Downloading for offline listening is fast and easy."
11643,AmazonMusic,A Google user,4,0,"I love listening to all my favorite music w/o ads, but it's annoying (and disingenuous) when songs disappear from my playlist because Amazon moved them from ""included w/the price of Prime"" to 'Music Unlimited""....which requires ANOTHER fee for what was advertised and included in my original Prime subscription ðŸ™„"
11644,AmazonMusic,Akshay AK,4,0,The app will be much more good if a feature to show the lyrics of a song while playing it is brought. Also the search needs to be much more refined because we will not get a result if there is a slight change in the spelling of the song we search.I would appreciate if you would take this review into notice.
11645,AmazonMusic,James Slusser,4,1,"moved from 1 star to 4 stars (more like 3.6) - app is now working as intended again. Good audio sound when streaming. Selection is good (not great). Minus 1 star for songs/albums disappearing from my library after downloading and having for months (sorry, no longer available). THAT is frustrating! Havent tried other services to compare yet, but that could be on the horizon."
11646,AmazonMusic,Mr_ Fabulous,5,74,This app just knows me and for that i am grateful! fresh new updated look. 2 things i wish it had; option to cross fade songs and continuous radio-like play after last song in que had played out.
11647,AmazonMusic,Laura Manel,4,0,"I'm pleased with this app. for the most part. My only complaints are songs that were already downloaded, disappearing and no longer being available, also not being able to listen to my music, that I've paid for, without using data."
11648,AmazonMusic,Will South Dakota,5,0,i love Amazon music. it has most all of the songs i want to hear on an easy format. i have recently upgraded to the family plan which my wife and son say they enjoy it as well. it replaced the xm in her car and is much cheaper .
11649,AmazonMusic,Luke Jones,4,0,"Not perfect but it works. It has every song I could think of. Menus are a little odd on the Galaxy s9 but useable. As much as Amazon makes off everything this service could stand to be a little cheaper, but what do I know."
11650,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,The Christian worship music that is available is great. I am delighted that the music that I have purchased via my laptop I can also listen to it on my mobile. Also being able to purchase the 'CD' at a decent price is also terrific.
11651,AmazonMusic,A Google user,4,0,"I've used the app for years. It has occasional glitches in playing music, but is usually no problem. Relatively easy to use. One suggestion would be a ""favorites"" button that would automatically make a playlist of your favorites."
11652,AmazonMusic,Michael Krieger,5,0,"I have purchased many songs though Amazon due to their extensive selection and good pricing. I enjoy the ease of use of the Amazon Music App and suggest it to anyone looking for a way to download music, create play lists and play music."
11653,AmazonMusic,Mike Salem,4,0,"good app, the desktop version is better i really like amazon music. i buy all my albums on it and then download them to my phone. its all pretty easy. the desktop site is great for throwing on some tunes easy and then going about your business."
11654,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,1,i have used this application for about a year and I truly enjoy it's easy to use and I recommend it for anybody out there that likes to listen to music and it likes to record music definitely worth the download.
11655,AmazonMusic,A Google user,2,0,"It does what it do and thats play music. Woul be 5* if it had player that could be used anytime when the app isn't open directly. Also, when you download an album, it does not download in order. Please Fix!"
11656,AmazonMusic,Danielle Boucher,1,4,Ever since your last update I have had nothing but problems with the app running. It constantly buffers it won't load I have tried uninstall link and re installing it in a did absolutely nothing I have cleared the cache partitions on my phone and has done absolutely nothing to help.
11657,AmazonMusic,Ben Barlow,5,0,"Great selections of music. Easy to navigate the app. Allows you to select specific songs, replay songs and gives lyrics in a Kareokee style for many of the songs available. Better than other music apps I have used!"
11658,AmazonMusic,Paul Connelly,5,0,if you are willing to pay then this is the best music app. I travel alot and downloaded music us a must. downloaded playlists is a must. easy to add a track to a playlist.. good value for money.
11659,AmazonMusic,shardul nimbalkar,5,0,"You can play the same song on other apps out there and then when you play the same song on Amazon music, the sound quality is just amazing , it feels like the high tunes are prefectly crisp , and the base is absolutely mind-blowing."
11660,AmazonMusic,Tony D,5,0,The app works great. It works seamlessly with my Alexa app to connect to any or all of my Echo's or Alexa enabled devices for single or multi room music. The settings for downloading are easy to find and control. I am gonna download some more music now.
11661,AmazonMusic,Fe licia,4,0,Thank God I can skip music. This monster of all predators should not be on any playlists on Amazon music. I am a loyal Amazon Prime customer and should not have to see nor hear his music on any list when I am trying to enjoy good music. IT JUST RUINS MY MOOD. #MuteRkelly #NOW
11662,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,"The ability to make my own playlists is so much fun! ... and as a drummer, I can get all my favorite songs! I love Amazon Music and am already thinking about another set of songs to save. Thanks! ... I'm enjoying it. Dave"
11663,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,"Love Amazon music. Very easy to navigate through the app, create playlists and search for new music. I also like that I get recommendation based on my listening preferences and getting introduced to new and not mainstream music."
11664,AmazonMusic,Nikki T,1,2,This music app is unreliable. I had taken the time to download songs..I go back today and the app states my downloaded music is empty. What a waste of time!
11665,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,"No commercials no Christmas music, Love it!!! I listen while I'm in the kitchen, my play list when I'm in the shower, or on my way to work!!! my husband and I really enjoy it!!!"
11666,AmazonMusic,Susan Burke,5,0,I could not do my job without Amazon music in my ears. It's so easy to use and discover new music and music that's just new to me. I listen in the car for no commercials and no satellite bill. Most importantly I never fail to find something that fits my mood.
11667,AmazonMusic,Casey Fender,5,0,I love the Amazon music app that allows me to listen to the music I can access through my prime subscription. The only thing is I wish we could upload your own music to your library like you used to could. Otherwise this is a really good app.
11668,AmazonMusic,Mike,2,0,The Alexa feature continues to come on in the middle of songs. It's thesame place on one of the songs as if it thinks someone is talking to it...and the words don't even sound like 'Alexa'. needs fixed asap or I'm switching back to spotify.
11669,AmazonMusic,Wilson McDonald,4,0,"It works as it probably should, though there can probably be improvements. It would be nice if you could select a default landing page so you can open it directly to a station or your music or whichever you want rather than their home page."
11670,AmazonMusic,Shane Pynes,1,0,"Amazon constantly is pulling music that was originally available through prime and requiring customers to upgrade to access certain songs. A real disappointment, particularly when a customer has built their own playlists with music that was previously available."
11671,AmazonMusic,alia Vande Berg,3,1,"normally I would give it a five, but now, no matter which type of internet or where I am, it won't let me browse online music, it keeps saying there's an error!"
11672,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,"i wanted to listen to my music on Amazon music and all my songs were gone. i looked my songs up on Amazon music and it said ""in your music"" but its not! is there any way that Amazon can fix it?1"
11673,AmazonMusic,April Jones,5,0,"BEST, BEST, BEST music app available today!!!! No hassles, no interruptions, no commercials, no delays!! Just clear, crisp sound and great music for as long as you want!!!!"
11674,AmazonMusic,Udit Kumar,3,0,"Even if I download the songs I still have to remain online to play my songs. The moment I turn off wifi or data, app give error and song plays stops. I mean It should happen with online songs but I'm talking about my downloaded songs."
11675,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,2,"Amazon music is one of those things i didnt realise i needed i needed in my life. use it constanly, from getting up, driving when working and at home. Opens up the opportunity to listen to music i wouldn't normally have not heard (even at my age). great service, well worth getting. never had problems with it either."
11676,AmazonMusic,Steven S,1,1,Horrific interface for a trillion dollar company. Where should I begin? Just throw it all away and start over. It is THAT bad. You're embarrassing yourselves.
11677,AmazonMusic,Brijesh Jadav,4,0,"Alexa, Ok Google trumps you big time; especially when we want to play Bollywood songs in languages. And you aren't responsive when the screen is off, just like YouTube on the phone. So buckle up, but you are good otherwise."
11678,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,"This is a hreat app because I can listen to any muisc that I love to listen to, I'm so glad that this s a thing I see so many people have this when they are listening to music and I do the same thing. Thank you, for this app!"
11679,AmazonMusic,Mac Baker,5,0,"The library catalog is very extensive and is close to but maybe comes up a tad short against ""Spotify""! I think they are definitely one of the top 2 or 3 streaming services currently available! Very high quality streaming rates!"
11680,AmazonMusic,Dan DeVetter,4,0,"The app is great and has a huge selection but doesn't interact well with Android (i.e. Google assistant can open the app but not play music). Dear Amazon, you don't make phones so if you don't get along with phone manufacturers then you will lose..."
11681,AmazonMusic,Sean Farrell,3,1,app has issues with functionality but the biggest issue is the songs getting removed frequently. sometimes the same song from a different album becomes available but it isnt automatically added to the library so you have to manuallu add same song over and over
11682,AmazonMusic,jmautobot,3,9,"Hasn't gotten any useful features for a year. I'm not interested in Alexa stuff. Good app though, but could use some UI work. Bit tedious to navigate around. I don't like that it keeps asking me to review even though I already have."
11683,AmazonMusic,Dina Scharnhorst,5,1,"I love being able to compile my own library to listen to wherever and whenever I want. The music options are endless and I can download most music into my library for free. But be aware: sometimes such tracks are removed from your library without warning and put among the selections you would either have to a) pay for each track; or b) pay for the Prime subscription. Either way, you pay."
11684,AmazonMusic,Matt Gochenaur,4,188,"great app for streaming music. has random glitches and the app freezes up sometimes, but overall it does what it supposed to do 99.9% of the time. happy customer"
11685,AmazonMusic,Ken Amos,5,0,Amazing! creating playlists and listening to artist stations are seamless! loving it so far! would be nice to get access to podcasts as well. or maybe I just havent discovered it yet! To my fellow Amazon Music Enthusiasts... Enjoy!!!!
11686,AmazonMusic,A Google user,3,0,how many times do I have to thumbs down a band before you realize I don't want to listen to it? more than ten? 20? who knows. why would you play the same songs in the same order on the radio station every time? that's called a playlist!
11687,AmazonMusic,Paul Hunter,3,1,"Thus music service better than nothing, as a perk with Amazon 2-day shipping and Prime video, but its a bad music app. Selection has become increasingly limited simce the launch of ""Prime unlimited"" or whatever its called, and the app crashes a lot and regularly just doesnt open. But there are some good finds which can be streamed/downloaded, but accessing them can be a challenge."
11688,AmazonMusic,A Google user,2,0,"I used to love this, but now, there are times my app will not open for days to over a week at a time. Also, they frequently remove music that was previously available on my playlists. Most of it was not even new music either. It feels like a plot to push me into upgrading to their Unlimited service, which i did actually try for a few months. SPOTIFY was much better for price and had more available music. Ill keep this, but only as long as it is Free with my Prime membership"
11689,AmazonMusic,David Grierson,1,1,"App will not play continuous albums without gaps, so there's no point in this app if you want to listen to opera or dance and dj mixes. Dreadful glitch in 2019, tbh."
11690,AmazonMusic,Elizena Arellano,5,0,"Going through extreme stress right now and Amazon music is helping me get through it. The music calms me and takes me away from the immediate problem for an hour or so, that way I can relax and unwind. Thank you!"
11691,AmazonMusic,Lucky Woody,5,0,I can't say enough about this. I love Amazon Music. Any song anytime. I can sleep now with out sleeping pills. Where has this been for the past 30 years. lol thanks for the invention of Amazon Music.
11692,AmazonMusic,Rose Williams,5,0,I'm addicted. You have every song I want to buy. Never downloaded music before. You make it simple and fun. Still learning to navigate the site but I have no regrets downloading this app. Love it.
11693,AmazonMusic,Anna Avramidis,2,0,kinda difficult to use. I try to save songs in a playlist but it doesn't wanna work sometimes. also I try to look up songs and half the time it just shows me the album it's in not the actual songs.
11694,AmazonMusic,tom booth,4,0,"Good product. However it seems more and more songs being migrated over to the ""Unlimited"" version, which requires monthly subscription. Hey Amazon, I'm already paying $100/year as a Prime member, and now you want ro squeeze anothe $8/month out of me?"
11695,AmazonMusic,chris putnam,4,1,"ok I have grown to like this app a bit more than when I first downloaded it. But one big improvement that could be made is having saved favorite ""radio stations"" that you can shuffle like they do on Pandora. Much easier when you want to listen to random songs from different genres and not have to keep searching or changing music. Other than that Amazon Prime members should have all access to ALL music, and only have to pay to download certain stuff. should listen for free."
11696,AmazonMusic,Manish Chatterjee,4,0,Good app with good quality audio. Most artisrs are now available. The collection has vastly improved and you now discover even new and upcoming artists which is a BIG plus! UI could be improved too for providing better suggestions. Still no option to favourite artists.
11697,AmazonMusic,A Google user,4,14,Pretty good and convenient. I enjoy being able to listen to all kinds of music. my only complaint is that it doesn't have all music. There are songs I would like to hear again but cannot find. Another issue is I have prime so why do I need to pay another fee for accessing certain songs/albums.
11698,AmazonMusic,James' Journeys,2,0,"It's okay, pretty much like Pandora or Google music. A lot of songs/artists either don't come up or you have to pay for them and no alternate suggestions are given. Of the three choices mentioned, I use Amazon the least."
11699,AmazonMusic,Ellie Lynas,5,1,"Amazon Music has given me my most perfect playlists! Every song I search for, I have found even really obscure ones! A tune for every mood, every emotion, every memory."
11700,AmazonMusic,Tractor Boy 2421,1,0,"awful .. truly awful. bought 3 songs, but cant pkay any (exception#182 ) phoned amazon & got no help .. basically its my phones fault !!! funny how it works with every other music app. amazon you are disgraceful & only interested in ripping people off. 30+ minutes on the phone for nothing AVOID THIS APP AT ALL COSTS"
11701,AmazonMusic,Raj Soniminde,2,0,"It's good for streaming and downloading but I didn't like the UI of the app as I have used wynk and jiosaavn and also wish we could select the downloaded songs and delete it in one click rather than doing it individually and also major hindi albums like Tiger zinda Hai,Befikre,Vicky Donor, lamberghini are missing what are you doing Amazon every music app has these very dissapointing not at all satisfied with this app......"
11702,AmazonMusic,Spook Killskillz,2,10,"this use to be a good app. now its very slow. Sometimes when you select an album, it takes forever for the info to come up. And im on a new phone with good signal."
11703,AmazonMusic,Ahmad AbulHaj,1,0,"even if you are a Amazon Prime subscriber, you dont have access to any good or popular song unless you make another subscription called Ultimate. this is so frustrating Amazon and this will also makes me want to cancel my regular Amazon prime subscription since it adds NO value whatsoever."
11704,AmazonMusic,Chuck Andrews,1,0,I started with Amazon Music and found songs that I really liked and added them to my playlist. Recently Amazon removed 30 percent of them from my playlist because they are no longer in their library. What a bunch of #@$%.
11705,AmazonMusic,john demusiak,5,0,"The app is easy to learn, and the selection of music is phenomenal. Prime is the best investment I have made in a long time. Im addition to Prime Music the other benefits of Prime make it the real deal. Thanks John Demusiak"
11706,AmazonMusic,Jeremy Fluxwick,4,0,"Great music app. Pity it only allows one user at a time without having to pay more. We pay for prime, use their services all the time and have four kids that want to use it. Other than that we think it's the best music app we've used."
11707,AmazonMusic,A Google user,3,0,"The app is ok but if you listen to it through Bluetooth, after a while it will stop playing and ask if you're still there, which is very anoying, specially if you're driving and can't look at the screen."
11708,AmazonMusic,Julian Aguilar-SÃ¸brevilla,5,34,"I was looking for music from th we Vietnam era, and I founded very fast, versus my sad experience looking for the same in Apple music, which never found any suggestions. 7 love Amazon music ."
11709,AmazonMusic,Richard Davidson,5,0,"I was a bit skeptical at first after trying Slacker, I-Heart and Apple! paid monthly for two of them and was a bit disappointed in all three after using Amazon music! My oldest son turned down the free trial of Apple he said he uses Amazon. He said it is way better and suggested I get Amazon Prime for the price! I love the selection of music, plus a huge seller for me is NO COMMERCIALS!!! I get annoyed with the commercial breaks and commentating, I just want to listen to music!"
11710,AmazonMusic,robert goodwin,4,0,Great selection of diverse music. Having the option of streaming from an unlimited cloud or offline download music is another plus. And the fact that it came free with our Amazon prime made it a no brainer.
11711,AmazonMusic,NapTime Gamin,2,0,they have nothing but pop music. i have a lot of random music favorites but cant find them. it might because of its the free one but im not paying for it until i figure out if they even have my songs.
11712,AmazonMusic,Angie Daniels Green,5,0,"Amazon Music has all the features Pandora is missing. Amazon Music provides song lyrics automatically, I can add music to my playlists with the touch of a button, and they're easily accessible. Adding or removing songs is simple. It's user-friendly, and I prefer it to every music app I've ever tried. The selection is seemingly unlimited and I can always count on them no matter the occasion or mood."
11713,AmazonMusic,Jeffrey Van Detta,5,0,"The most amazing music source for classical music devotees like me. Vitrually the entire recorded catalog, available to you anytime. anywhere! Having this is the dream of a lifetime, fulfilled!"
11714,AmazonMusic,Jason Waddell,4,0,"I like the app so far. I've had this for about two weeks now. I got to say I'm pretty satisfied. The only downside, I can't use it on my PS4. Other than that, I like it. Also, it's a plus for Amazon prime users. That gave me a bit of a discount. So, that's always nice. ðŸ˜"
11715,AmazonMusic,Randy Bookwalter,2,0,"the sample music is great but if you want to listen to anything new they make you pay the unlimited price of 7.99 a month. $96 a year is way too much for music, might as well listen to youtube."
11716,AmazonMusic,Eric Tomaszewski,3,0,At times Im viewing facebook with amazon music. when I play fb video with sound - amazon stops (nice) and then usually restarts after video BUT at times it doesnt start back and ecen manually I xant get into app nor start playing nor do anything else until I manually close amazon music app & start again or sometimes even restart mobile. can u fix for 5 stars pls? thx Eric
11717,AmazonMusic,Laura Cantu,5,0,"love Amazon music. just 1 problem. it keeps logging me out and when I log back in I have to download all my music again because it ""erases"" my offline music. it pretty frustrating to have to do this multiple times a week."
11718,AmazonMusic,Robin Banks,1,2,"terrible app...always looking for more money off you to upgrade subscription. Crappy music app won't play my content on my ""Amazon Echo""...yes, that's right, not even on its own linked Echo"
11719,AmazonMusic,Rigo Anchondo,2,0,"Good selection of music, BUT, the app is very glitchy. It drops out, gets caught in loops, doesn't remove music in my list, and so on. I keep it around because my son uses it. Otherwise I would cancel."
11720,AmazonMusic,Moose Mann,4,0,overall as a portal to the vast collection of music it is functional without being spectacular. the whats playing access button located central bottom of the screen can make it difficult to access the more info 'button' - 3 stacked dots - of the last album on lhs of screen.
11721,AmazonMusic,Jessica Stokes,4,0,"app is great. easy to navigate. love that you can download songs and use it offline. lots of great songs and playlists. unfortunately it doesnt always have the songs you want and sometimes when it does, they are just cover songs."
11722,AmazonMusic,Patti Walkenhorst,3,0,"it's decent, but I have troubles getting my music playlists to play on Alexa. and.....frequently, my music skips (like on the old vinal records) no matter what medium I am playing it on.....cell, laptop, work, home. I don't experience this with Spotify."
11723,AmazonMusic,Brittany Vincent,3,0,I enjoy the music I have been able to download and the ability to make playlists. The reason I only rate this app a 3 star is because everytime I've gotten a new phone and download the app on it I have to recreate all of my playlists and some of the songs I have downloaded randomly disappear.
11724,AmazonMusic,mohith ryuu,2,0,"Good content, but horrible interface. Need options like go to artists, add artists as favourites, move to previous songs no matter where we started playing and so on. i hope they get this done cuz the content is one of the best out there."
11725,AmazonMusic,A Google user,3,0,"The browser library is spotty at best. Albums often times have the incorrect artwork and found under incorrect artists. Downloads are also hit or miss. Bought songs sometimes don't download and have a red (!) appear next to it or won't download to my SD card. I had an album I bought only download half of the songs, the others weren't available so I tried removing the album to re-download it, but it won't let me. I need help to fix these issues."
11726,AmazonMusic,Nolan Kittrell,5,0,I throughly enjoy this app! The stations are quite good and very numerous. The number of albums available for download is great. I love that it's included with Prime!!!!!
11727,AmazonMusic,Michael DeLatte,3,0,I like Amazon music boy seems though y'all keep taking songs all of my lineup that I've had for a while and now I have to join unlimited to get them again I'm thinking about going with iTunes and dropping Amazon Prime completely I think that's very wrong to take songs away and have to pay more money to get them back again and I'm already a prime member
11728,AmazonMusic,C S,1,1,"everytime I change my password it clears my list of music in both the online and downloaded list. I can maybe understand the downloaded, though since I didn't delete the app it kind of makes me wonder about their definition of download. but there's no reason the online my music list should be emptied. even the most basic music apps can save that when you log back in. now I have to manually remember and read each and every song and redo all my playlists. thanks Amazon."
11729,AmazonMusic,William Krack,4,0,"Close to phenomenal...get the band ""hockey night"" album 'rad zapping' along with a couple other EP's of theirs...and it'd be full on phenomenal with all five stars. But a must have app for music lovers that like to shop none the less."
11730,AmazonMusic,Steven Turner,4,0,Pros - excellent music library. -easy interface and lots of choice to build own playlist. opportunites -cost. worth money but hard to bring in outsiders that are not prime members -great playlist but not simple for casual users to join.
11731,AmazonMusic,earl bird31,1,2,can NOT access my playlists. it has either deleted them or there just not showing up. I cant stand this. please make the playlists easier to access.
11732,AmazonMusic,AC Pollo,1,4,"Amazon Music app for Android is a complete mess. Anyone who expects songs to play to play in the same order on this app as the physical media will be sorely disappointed. Hello Amazon, you list it correctly on your Website, why cannot you list the songs in the correct order in Amazon Music? I've spend at least 20 minutes trying to see if there is anyway to get it correct, but no. Lame."
11733,AmazonMusic,Nick DeGelorm,5,0,Absolutely fantastic. I made the switch from iHeart and I've never been happier. I even have the unlimited so any song I can think of I can play with any of my Alexa devices at a moments notice!
11734,AmazonMusic,Angela Kelly,4,0,"Positives: somgs you've purchased on Amazon are quickly accessible, playlists are easy to create, & some ""stations"" available similar to Spotify Negatives: songs you've downloaded with Prime disappear without warning, & app opens with ad for their ""unlimited"" music service"
11735,AmazonMusic,A Google user,3,0,App has strengths and weaknesses - biggest weakness - why won't the app close!? I have to shut down my phone to make it fully close in the background. why is that? annoying!
11736,AmazonMusic,Willis Morris,4,0,I like the variety of music found inAmazon music app. With Alexa things are much easier. However it would be even better if we could access Alexa directly without having to krep the app on on-screen.
11737,AmazonMusic,Cody Griffin,3,0,"The recommended playlist options are not as good as they should be. All my suggestions are small playlists, the are no autogenerated suggested lists that i can click on which will last me the full duration of a 1 hour workout."
11738,AmazonMusic,Morgan Lamb,5,0,Ill be honest i only downloaded it to buy the new bts album (map of the soul: persona) BUT i lowkey fell in love with it lol I might just keep this and and drop my youtube subscriptionðŸ¤·ðŸ» it was really easy to use and everything is organized so its a win for me!
11739,AmazonMusic,Comedy For Giants The Band,3,0,Library is solid and as a Prime subscriber it was a fair price I feel. Performance keeps it from achieving five-star greatness. It takes a long time to cycle occasionally when re-opening and reboots seemingly at random
11740,AmazonMusic,Ian Hamilton,1,2,"Absolute garbage, stops playing for no apparent reason, won't play some saved tracks randomly, works when it feels like it when trying to use Chromecast Audio which was the main reason I got it, if it wasn't free I'd ask for my money back. update, it's still shite"
11741,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,8,"at first I was skeptical about another Amazon product ....it seems as though they are taking over the world , and yes this music solution as I will call it has been exactly that!!! it is a solution so to speak , a remedy for all of the garbage high priced and low quality music players that we've all experienced . I love it and best of all it is alexa compatibale!!! all around 5 stars and I would give it 5 more if I could."
11742,AmazonMusic,Thomas Peterson,3,0,"Amazon Music is a solid application. However, it suffers from an ever changing library where music is added and removed all the time. It is difficult to search for new music and indentify the most popular versions of songs."
11743,AmazonMusic,Steve Arena,4,0,"i love it, but the only annoying problem I have is that it buffers at least 2-3 times on every song or every other song, even when im 6 feet away from my modem with 5g Wi-Fi, it's much better listening offline. this don't happen with Pandora"
11744,AmazonMusic,A Google user,3,2,"It's like when we try to play music in poor network, it not even opens... One suggestion _ please add download option where we can download bulk songs at a time.. Bec many times we get pissed by selecting single song abd download it.."
11745,AmazonMusic,Mahesh Kumar,1,0,"I like this app so much where I use it for all time Listening songs, I just want one thing to be fixed for my One Plus 6T where i can't change the song from lock screen. if you can help me with this, it'll be great."
11746,AmazonMusic,Sumant Jawale,2,8,"confusing to use the app, a bit sluggish sometimes to use. sorting of the music should be organised properly. Cant find some of the songs I want to listen."
11747,AmazonMusic,A Google user,1,2,few days before i had approx 1100 songs in my offline playlist with more than 1000 music downloaded from prime but now half of them are gone and i am left with only 400 songs. Please do something.
11748,AmazonMusic,Pankaj Mhatre,4,0,"Nice app. But I need controls on lock screen as well to be able to change tracks etc. Also, it is difficult to navigate to new playlist while some song is running. But, overall the app is stable and I get most of the dongs Im looking for"
11749,AmazonMusic,Linda Robbins,5,0,I haven't found a record that isn't on Amazon music yet. I have over 500 albums and numerous songs and play lists in my music. I love the shuffling of the various songs. It's almost like a mood is set for different times of day and days of the week.
11750,AmazonMusic,Larry Lineweaver,3,0,"Navigating the site is clunky. Trying to move within the store to make purchases, having to touch beside of purchase buttons instead of on them, always being promoted for unlimited service, etc. make for less than a five star experience."
11751,AmazonMusic,jeff vineyard,2,0,"best music app I have however, it does suck that they arbitrarily remove access to music from my downloads. I figure since I pay for the service, as long as I continue to pay I should have full access to my songs."
11752,AmazonMusic,Greg Flynn,5,12,"Way better than pandora as it has lyrics for most of the songs and unlimited only costs $7.99. I also love the built in Aexa so I can control the media without having to touch my phone. (I do wish Icould have access to Alexa when the app is in the background too, but im sure its too battery intensive)"
11753,AmazonMusic,chuck Bozek,1,4,"consistently crashing. Uninstalled it and downloaded it.....updated...still after 2 songs it will crash. Oh yeah i forgot, if you want to throw more money away this is the app for you. Why didn't i go with Pandora?"
11754,AmazonMusic,A Google user,4,3,"The only thing that keeps this app from being five stars is the limited selection of music, if you want truly unlimited songs, you have to buy yet another subscription. But other than that minor grievance, the app works great! Decent amount of songs, very friendly UI, and runs off cellular using very little data, so you can listen to it on the go"
11755,AmazonMusic,Jeremiah Bernier,2,2,was great up until the last update. Now the ap crashes seconds into the first song. It's highly irritating considering it cost money.
11756,AmazonMusic,Theresa Kinder,3,3,"Amazon would get 5 stars but now they keep changing songs that are free and pushing the ""unlimited"" for $on top of the 120.00 you already pay yearly. GREEDY."
11757,AmazonMusic,Ken Johnson,4,0,"o listen to more classical, Southern Gospel, and rock and roll ""golden oldies"" (40s, 50s, and 60s) type music. I don't care for the overdone push towards nonsense popular music."
11758,AmazonMusic,Varun Lokre,5,0,"It's a simply fantastic app. they have a wonderful variety of songs. They have a really great collection. love the various stations that offer only rock n roll, jazz. fantastic app."
11759,AmazonMusic,Matthew Gochenaur,1,1,"This app sucks. Uninstalled app 3 times, still having issues on my Pixel 2XL. Firstly, when searching your ""online music"" for a song, the one you pick does not play. Instead the first song in your catalog listed by alphabetical order will play and go into shuffle mode. Secondly, downloaded music will stop playing when cell service is low or not available. Its almost as if your live streaming 24/7. Problem goes away when in airplane mode though"
11760,AmazonMusic,Margarita Lopez,5,1,"I love Amazon Music!! From the moment I wake until I get home from work, I listen to music via Amazon Music. I listen while I get ready for work, in my commute to and from work, at the office, and when I'm home - while doing chores and as I entertain friends. Amazon Music is my go to music app. I love that my music is not interrupted by commercials, ever. Also love that I can set the app to block any Explicit songs or albums. I have a Playlist long of 2500 songs and adding. Amazon Music rocks!!"
11761,AmazonMusic,simply private,5,4,"Anything I want to hear is in Amazon and everything I could hear, is on Amazon. The app is also as good as any music manager available, I am hoping that the playlists I create can be available on any media device I have which is connected to the web. I love the app, I can own media digitally or buy the CD or both, you can't do that with Spotify. The Apple Store is a leading media platform and music manager right there with Amazon but I like where I'm at here."
11762,AmazonMusic,Robot Crunch,5,0,"Great app in general. Have barely any complaints about amazon music, save for that Amazon's kind of an evil company in general. But here i am, a hypocritical american consumer, rating their app 5 stars. Oh well."
11763,AmazonMusic,Gregory Myers,3,0,"decent, but... slow response time.. doesn't work well with Android auto. you have to wait over 10 seconds at times to skip tracks.. Spotify and Google play music doesn't do that. fix it. please."
11764,AmazonMusic,A Google user,3,0,"for a paid service, the selected stations suck. They repeat the same songs over and over whenever you pick an artist. For a service that charges, they should have a better system that shuffles songs more often."
11765,AmazonMusic,Pasta Tots,4,196,"Awesome sound quality. Music unlimited is pretty expensive, though. Amazon's algorithm isn't quite as good as Pandora, but it does the job."
11766,AmazonMusic,Cody Liddle,1,6,"I'm giving 1 star so you guys read this. When downloading music the app will freeze up and I have to force close it. This is a pain when I've been browsing and can't rember where I was, in browsing, plus the wasting of my time really bothers me. I like this app, I'd give it 5 stars without this issue, but if this continues for much longer I will be giving another company my money"
11767,AmazonMusic,Clayton Wilkie,5,0,"what a bloody great app this Amazon Music is , it has my favorite groups from the 1970's, like the groupmHUSH , from Australia as they were a dam greatvgroup of it's time ..love it , if I could give a 10 for it then I would have given 10 out ofv10 for it ..."
11768,AmazonMusic,kristina fb,5,0,"this option costs $$, and there are free radio stations. i like this cuz i can choose from any genre of music, which is eclectic, any time i want to, turn it off & pick it up again from where i stopped."
11769,AmazonMusic,Seth Barry,3,1,"Amazon Music has good quality music, but its app is written for a ""heavy"" phone with good processing capabilities and quick SD card access. Not recommended for mid-quality phones."
11770,AmazonMusic,A Google user,2,0,"I live in Germany with an account in Amazon DE but I speak English. Why is it that I cannot use my language of choice for the menus, song titles and summaries of the available content but I am locked to the German language?"
11771,AmazonMusic,A D,4,0,Really amazing selection of songs. Would wish for more Bollywood / Hindi songs though. Like that it plays the song you search for (unlike Pandora) and that there doesn't seem to be a limit on songs that can be skipped.
11772,AmazonMusic,Stephanie Mitchel,4,0,reliable + generous - this app is predictably pop-forward but if you know what you're after there's a very good chance you'll find it. i'd like to think we could look forward to a broader international palette...
11773,AmazonMusic,Shabby Dame,4,1,"The music catalog is pretty enormous. There have only been a few obscure bands I haven't been able to find. Things here and there could be better, but overall it's a great app. The playlists can be fun and used to find new music. You can also create playlists of your own. The thing I like most is that you can shuffle the whole discography of one artist (rather than listening only to a shuffled station of the artist along with other similar artists.) I use this app literally every day."
11774,AmazonMusic,Aimee Bixby,5,0,Amazon prime has all types of music for your enjoyment. Everything new to all the old classics. You should definitely be a prime member of Amazon to enjoy all the benefits of this app. ðŸ˜Š It's a great musical experience!
11775,AmazonMusic,A Google user,1,0,"The Amazon music app just told me that all my downloaded music has expired, and do I want to refresh my music. I sure would like to but I can't. If i have to re-down load everything I'm switching back to Spotify."
11776,AmazonMusic,Sabrina Lando-Thomas,3,0,"I have never had a problem with music purchases being downloaded to my library before this year. Customer service takes their time answering emails. They debit my account quickly, but are slow at putting the songs into my library."
11777,AmazonMusic,A Google user,2,1,They have removed so much music from my Prime membership. They want to force me to spend $120 more to get access to the music that was available with Prime. No thanks.
11778,AmazonMusic,Richard Morris,3,6,Good music service but annoying how it keeps deleting songs that are 'no longer available' but clearly are by searching for them. Doesn't always add songs to playlist although it shows that it has. Keep getting error #94 when trying to delete songs from playlist that are no longer available.
11779,AmazonMusic,Janeen Schreiber,4,0,"i like to download music and listen to it for a while before i buy to make sure it is what i want. But then songs tend to just disappear and when i try to find them to buy, they are nowhere to be found. i find this pretty irritating."
11780,AmazonMusic,Wolf1 AJ,4,0,"I love Anazon Music I just wish to see more anime show music. I used to and that to my play lists and thpugh I understand why Amazon got rid of that option, I still love my anime songs. Please do more music from this genre."
11781,AmazonMusic,Darby Horgan,5,0,Absolutely love this! Finally can listen to all my music I've been missing. They have a HUGE selection. Even quite obscure stuff. Have not run into any problems whatsoever. I highly recommend!
11782,AmazonMusic,MLG Youtubing,5,0,"I love Amazon music & all the options it gives you!!! It's so easy to download your music & be able to listen to it anywhere you are including when I don't have any service, which I haven't found any other apps with the wide range of music that has that same option. I love that I can have a couple playlists for myself as well as have two seperate playlists suitable for each of my kids. It truly is the best music app I've ever encountered!"
11783,AmazonMusic,Yvette Lyons,4,0,Great app. Love the variety of music. Do not like Amaxon removing songs previously offered and I have added to my play list. Amazon put the songs as no longer available. Do not like Indian givers.
11784,AmazonMusic,Krystal Fedotova,4,0,I live this app mostly but lately there are times when I select one song and another song plays. No error message or anything it just won't play the song. Other than that it's a pretty good app.
11785,AmazonMusic,Charles Edge,3,0,"I love how I can download most music to my phone for offline listening. The only issue I have is that they don't have complete discographies for artist it seems like. For instance, Rammstein. There are two full albums of...like 6-7 that they have put out. Aside from that and some bugs in the app itself, its easy to use. I would like to see a built in EQ in the app as well."
11786,AmazonMusic,John Hanel,3,0,i like it but problem. doesn't play wma but tries to and hangs playback. also if i delete or move or rename files it thinks old ones are still there and tries to play them. need a way to way to sync offline music other than uninstall reinstall.
11787,AmazonMusic,Shelley Ritter,3,0,"when I try and play some songs the app keeps wanting to update permissions. I do it and it doesn't change anything, it's still, it's still won't play the songs and says to update permissions"
11788,AmazonMusic,Jack Clifford,5,0,I love ordering CD's from Amazon because they are automatically put on the Amazon Music app and I can play my music at home or take it with me. Really easy app to use as well. Thanks Amazon.
11789,AmazonMusic,Paul Day,1,1,"Constantly vibrates/alerts phone on track stop, track start and, so it seems, for no other apparent reason other than to vibrate/alert. Quite annoying, please resolve Huawei Mate 10 Pro - UK Voda"
11790,AmazonMusic,Kevin Smith,1,1,it's hard to find the music i have bought amongst what Amazon want to sell me and paying for 3amazon prime doesn't make it much better un fact I can't play any of my paid for music on my phone unless I have a computer handy to manage my devices what sh1.t
11791,AmazonMusic,Aman Rana,1,1,"app not working properly, crashibg everytime im opening the app.. this problem is continuing from last month.. what the hell!.. still problem not solved, im using one plus 5t. what i have to do?"
11792,AmazonMusic,Jake Greentree,3,0,I love the app! BUT I already pay for Amazon prime to have the account but you still want me to pay more to listen to popular songs and buy the unlimited??? That's ridiculous! If i didn't pay for prime i would just buy spotify
11793,AmazonMusic,Vivek Bendigeri,5,0,"Love the quality, and collection sets of different genre. But please include many more regional songs as well. If you are reading this, my desire is that - Please include a functionality for Reverb sound effect in the app."
11794,AmazonMusic,Robert Rotenberry,3,0,While i like the majority of the music available the programming of the stations is horrendous. 75% of the songs are the same over and over. Plus there's random songs that don't belong on said station. So disappointed.
11795,AmazonMusic,Chad Clark,1,3,The App wont even open anymore. it crashes on the load up screen. Even when it works it runs very poorly. Amazon should be embarrassed by this app. i pay over $20 a month between Prime and unlimited the fact that i cant use the app at all is unacceptable.
11796,AmazonMusic,Amit Verma,5,0,Great experience with Amazon music lots of songs available on the store. Creating my lovable play list and I am an amazon prime customer so I can also download the music on my device. But few Bollywood movie songs are not available on the store like Namaste London.
11797,AmazonMusic,Sese R.,4,0,"The selection in Amazon Unlimited is awesome. the drawback is that it doesn't carry everything and a lot of times, you have something in your music, then you don't have access to it. That's upsetting. Also, I think that it should come with the cost of Amazon Prime."
11798,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,"A clearly thought out Music app that delivers exactly the kind of interface they promise. I cannot definitively measure the quality of the streams, but for whatever reason it seems that what I'm hearing is of higher quality."
11799,AmazonMusic,s T,4,0,"At first I thought it was PART of my amazon prime or maybe I got a discount because i am a prime customer. not exactly how i thought.. However, I decided to try it for 90 days and see if i like it enough to keep it."
11800,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,"I love music and having access to all the music i love is awesome. It's perfect for working out, studying or just relaxing. Has awesome playlist for you to listen or create your own. Listen to the melodies you love."
11801,AmazonMusic,Archana Singh,3,1,there is a bug in this app...in my downloading songs there were some errors...please fix that bug..the app was taking so much time to download multiple songs...fix it
11802,AmazonMusic,gemini5865,1,2,Horrible app. Typical low life exploitation of my personal information. Also automatically tried to upgrade my score to 3 stars. Not worth 3 stars.
11803,AmazonMusic,Victoria Emmerson,1,0,almost all the songs I've downloaded have been blacked and moved to amazon unlimited. I already pay why pay more when I can get it free on pandora. Dont waste your time or effort unless you want to pay alot.
11804,AmazonMusic,Ghost,1,0,"After every song, music goes silent and i have to pause the song and press play again to hear it. It's not pausing or muting, it just goes silent. AFTER EVERY SONG... FIX THIS NOW... ALMOST GOT HIT BY A CAR ON MY BIKE"
11805,AmazonMusic,Rachel Vincent,3,0,"Was great until they decided to create Amazon Unlimited which means that you have to pay on top of your Prime to access full range. Also in my last phone switch, it didn't remember my offline playlists so I had to redo them (I live in the countryside where signals are limited for operating off o line playlists, despite the music being downloaded). It would be great if you could copy a playlist from online to offline and vice versa. That said, it's alright and I like the online playlists."
11806,AmazonMusic,X3DX REAPER,4,0,"Overall pretty good and reliable, but selection of songs limited- yes has a lot but Spotify or iTunes has (at least ones I wanted to get). But word of caution, do not change the date of your phone. Setting it forward was fine, but everything failed when it was put back. At least I got time to appreciate the 4700 songs I had to redownload again I guess. However in doing so I found out that some had been deleted off amazon's list, including one which was an ""amazon exclusive""."
11807,AmazonMusic,Nanette Koudelka,5,0,"I love Amazon Music! I can find anything I want to listen to, even brand new music. I'm an older person, who's used to hunting for the album or CD I want, so this is like magic for me!"
11808,AmazonMusic,Ian Hughes,5,0,"love the app. Great music on the go with Prime Music. Never had a problem with it. Using my phone as a hotspot, I connect my tablet then play music through my Bluetooth speaker when out camping."
11809,AmazonMusic,Ken Newman,5,0,I have been using Amazon Music for a couple of years and apart from the occasional glitch I am delighted with the quality of this product. Long may it last. I am 97 years old and I spend several hours a day with my headphones on listening to a wide range of genre. Keep up the good work!
11810,AmazonMusic,Amit Kumar,3,0,"how my phone call recordings downloaded in the Download folder. All downloaded recording can not be selected at once for deletion, provision should be there to select all downloaded content at once in stead select one by one to delete."
11811,AmazonMusic,DULLBULL 02,4,0,"The app is real good for music online for my region songs and english songs, but i can't seem to access songs of other regions like korean etc that is a bit disappointing. But then again overall its a very good app."
11812,AmazonMusic,Nicole Potter,5,0,"I just wish they had a fade into the next song option ... but other than that, I'm very pleased with amazon prime music. Will there ever be an option to play the amazon downloaded music without the amazon app?"
11813,AmazonMusic,Joy H,4,10,I like the music options and it's nice that there are no commercials. Occasionally some of the songs in my playlists will get removed from Amazon music which is kind of frustrating. I don't like that 2 people can't stream music at the same time but you can get around that by downloading your playlist and listening offline.
11814,AmazonMusic,Sushovit Rout,5,0,"Amazon music updates it's collection real time. They optimize their music suggestions based on your search preferences. I love Amazon Music app. I listen to it every day on my way to office, helps keeping my mind calm."
11815,AmazonMusic,Tom Warmuth,4,1,"I like Amazon music. I have seen better interfaces, but still an enjoyable experience. Two fixes and this would be perfect for me. 1. It would be nice when I buy a CD off of Amazon that it would be downloadable in Amazon music, I would pay extra for a CD for this function. 2. I would be nice if I could cast from my Android phones and tablets to my TVs."
11816,AmazonMusic,Aniruddh Paralikar,3,0,Savan has better audio quality and lots of choices... you don't have much of a song list. I typically looked for Bruno Mars albums and they were cover songs instead of originals. Amazon music cannot be my first choice of music player
11817,AmazonMusic,Christy Sharp,2,0,"Initially the music choice was great. Since Amazon launched their 'unlimited' option, which cost more per month, the music selection for Prime has become extremely limited and poor. When I am near wifi, my music app of choice is Spotify."
11818,AmazonMusic,Brian Farmer,2,0,In the last month the songs have been cutting out and there seems to be a lot of static; even when playing downloaded music. All other music apps play fine. not sure what has happened. Very dissatisfied right now.
11819,AmazonMusic,Nichole Poppell,5,0,I really like all things Amazon. Amazon Music is a great app. I love it because I can switch between my songs and my twins songs. We love the variety of kids songs available and everything is so simple to use!
11820,AmazonMusic,Beth Jones,2,0,doesn't allow you to build a queue or select a song to play next. this is basic stuff i would expect. Edit: queue option popped up day after i posted this review then disappeared the following day. really frustrating app.
11821,AmazonMusic,Katheren Stabler,2,0,target Audience is 20 year olds. plays music I hate. not enough music i like. asked Alexa to play rock and roll. gave me the Beatles. there's no way to stop all rap music. it is mixed in with regular songs.
11822,AmazonMusic,William Slingsby,5,0,"i.love having so much music to choose from. To be abke to search for and listen to different types of music that, I wouldnt normally listen to. The result is my music taste is far more eclectic than it once was."
11823,AmazonMusic,Michael Robertson,4,4,Great experience overall.. very intuitive. All the music I want to listen to is there. would recommend. Also great to have along side alexa.
11824,AmazonMusic,Sandra Brennan,5,3,I really love it! I got an Echo Dot and it came with 4 months ofcFree Amazon Music service . really enjoy streaming in my car through my phone now that my car Sirius subscription ended!
11825,AmazonMusic,Anna Richardson,5,0,"Getting Amazon music unlimited was literally the best decision I've ever made. It is well worth the money, and is the best app experience for listening to music. 10/10 would reccomend."
11826,AmazonMusic,jamminjimmyjam,4,0,"I got to say so far it's been pretty good I like the unlimited because any time any song pops into my mind are they usually have it so over the other services I'm happy with with what I have with this existing service, I recommended with four stars."
11827,AmazonMusic,Megan Uhing,5,0,"Love it. No commercials, but wish they would have included the upgrade music for a reasonable price. $9.99 a month is crazy! I just buy the songs I really want and it costs me much less."
11828,AmazonMusic,Sean Sainvilus,1,0,"Was a great a, but since the new update, it's been doing nothing but crashing. With that being said I'm considering getting a new music streaming app until they get there self's together."
11829,AmazonMusic,N P,5,0,"i enjoy Amazon music when I am walking my dogs, mowing the lawn or just relaxing, some songs have moved to the unlimited format, which is disappointing, but still a lot if decent songs available."
11830,AmazonMusic,Avram Braverman,3,0,"it is an amazing app, however, when i tap the back button the app just freezes on me, and it has happened on several phonea and wireless carriers, leqding me to believe that the app has a big when you tap the back button to go to a previous playlist or page. Also I wish we were able to edit song and artist information directly from the app itself rather than having to do it on your computer. Otherwise, I like the app very much"
11831,AmazonMusic,Weridpolariods,1,0,"layout needs to be upgraded cuz this feels wayy too old.. im switching spotify cuz im someone who enjoys the interface, and amazon music feels its from 2010. Many apps have updated the layouts.. even amazon prime videos and the echo app got new refreshed layouts. Your is holding back on the layout of the music app."
11832,AmazonMusic,Suresh Kumar,4,0,"i would rate it 5 but when i added songs to a playlist on my desktop app, they didnt show up on my phone! it was frustationg to add songs again one by one. works fine on ipad though! android app needs to be polished a little more."
11833,AmazonMusic,Mark Davis,5,0,this is the only app I use for music. it is easy to use and let's me access my amazon music. it does freeze up from time to time. this could be my phones fault. overall the app is well organized and easy to use.
11834,AmazonMusic,Nick Roots,3,7,"Easy to f9nd music and giid choice inckuded with Prime. HOWEVER, app constantly freezes when i hut back to come out of what ive been playing. Hace to closebthe aoo and restart and ut can take a good 30 seconds to come back to life"
11835,AmazonMusic,mary beth Callahan,5,0,"I love amazon music for a lot of reasons but number one is that with amazon music I can have my music on my phone, tablets, computers, tv, and Alexa. My music is always with me one way or another."
11836,AmazonMusic,Ceverlyn Jenkins,5,0,Amazon Misic always has what I'm looking for. Even the more exclusive artist in reggae and jazz. The new albums from my favorite artist are here too and I can listen to the whole album. Loving Amazon Music.
11837,AmazonMusic,Katie P,4,0,Great app for listening to music. Especially if you have an Alexa device to connect with and use as a speaker. Wish it was more user-friendly. Layout of app is a bit chaotic. Would still recommended.
11838,AmazonMusic,Maureen Lucas,5,0,I enjoy the music as part of my prime account. I walkabout the city with one earbud in and walk with the beat of the music. I workout to the music. You won't regret having this app. Music to take along.
11839,AmazonMusic,hari krishnan,5,0,I like it so far..Got some good classical music stations.The UI is smooth and friendly and attractive.The music quality is also great.Yet to try the Alexa voice commands and the song list is growing.I have recommended this app to a few friends and looking forward to more number of songs and international languages and genres.
11840,AmazonMusic,Silentxzero,2,0,"Nice looking app, but severely lacking in the more important areas. Ease of use is seriously a 3 out of 10 and the music volume seems sigificantly lower than my other music players. Forget about changing playlists or artists while driving, its like a 3 step process. It desperatly needs a ""my music"" shortcut on the ""now playing"" screen, or something similar. Also if you do the math on streaming music the monthly charge is worth about 10 songs, I never bought 10 songs a month before. Not worth it."
11841,AmazonMusic,Thomas Huggins,1,3,Recent changes to Prime music are terrible. If I minimize the window it loses my playlist. It continually prompts me to buy the unlimited version. Also I no longer have access to music that I've already purchased.
11842,AmazonMusic,Jill Andersen,4,0,"I love that amazon inckudes this app wirh Prime. It has a fatal error unfortunately. Alexa closes down the app every few songs!! i have written umpteen times and nothing has changed. Iwont uograde to premium until this is corrected, of course."
11843,AmazonMusic,A Google user,3,0,this app has issues. creating a new playlist and every song you try to add is already in the playlist but not accessible and not showing. so glad I didn't go for the unlimited version.
11844,AmazonMusic,Lotti Lives,2,0,Used to be brilliant like the rest of their products. Now there are songs missing... Can't find other easy titles and no longer compatible with shazam.... Think I will be changing suppliers.... Shame. I am a loyal amazon customer
11845,AmazonMusic,Geoffrey Haselden,3,0,"I love the variety of music available on prime, but the UI is a little sluggish and out of date. Also could benefit from integration with the OS so you can select songs as ring tones and alarms."
11846,AmazonMusic,Wendy Middlemass,3,0,I love Amazon music overall. Lots of great songs to listen to. The unfortunate part is you add songs you like to your playlists only to come back the next day to find that they're unavailable.
11847,AmazonMusic,Linnie Whitt,5,0,"I love Amazon music!! it gives such a variety of music, all types and genres!! i love the different stations as wellðŸ˜ðŸ˜ would give more than 5 stars if I could!!!"
11848,AmazonMusic,Gerhard Thielmann,4,4,"good selection of music, mostly old stuff though (when I first started using it I felt a little nostalgic; not going to lie). Some more newer titles would make it a 5 star streaming service. Love that I can download music to my device to play when I don't have access to the internet or simply want to save data"
11849,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,"love it by far the best music player ive ever had. all the qualities of pandora, youtube red, i heart radio and all others rolled into one and bonus it has none of there flaws. paying for music unlimited is so worth it. i will be keeping with it."
11850,AmazonMusic,Anida Cox,5,0,i never give 5 stars. ever. this app is the best thing Amazon has going right now. . Every song you ask for they have. plus great playlists. nothing dumbed down. easy to use. Now if they would just pay thier TAXES....
11851,AmazonMusic,A Google user,3,1,"nice to have but a lot of the music I want to listen to is only available with ""unlimited"". If you play a station, the songs start repeating after a few hours."
11852,AmazonMusic,Monica Reed,5,0,"i like it... just wish they had more old school variety of songs... and i've already rated this app... yet, every time i log on to play my music... it always ask me to rate this app... ðŸ¤·ðŸ¤· plz stop...!"
11853,AmazonMusic,Matt Schlatre,3,0,pretty good music app but not as good as Utube. plus u have to do proper spelling to find a song. this app gets 2 thumbs down. sorry. Also they can take songs from your library without notice. kind of petty if you ask me.
11854,AmazonMusic,Joshua Anderson,4,1,This is us very good and the only way to listen music fought from them but they need to knock it off with the constant ads for their streaming service. I've said no about a thousand times.
11855,AmazonMusic,A Google user,1,6,"used to be good, now the price is too high and you keep taking my selected artists away and unable to retrieve. I'm in the process of finding other music and movie options. Don't even really need your two day shipping, can usually find what I'm looking for cheaper with free shipping my take a few more days but most of the time I can wait. Sorry I have been a good customer spent a lot and it's not as good a deal anymore. Al Gsutot"
11856,AmazonMusic,A Google user,2,0,I do really like this app except for the fact that it doesn't seem to want to stay working it acts like I have no internet but it's on my cell phone which has a data package which I think I shouldn't have to always have to restart my phone to get it to work and it would be nice if it would be available to you offline since phone my old phone is what I play it on sometimes and it does not have internet access
11857,AmazonMusic,A Google user,3,0,"Selection sucks even if your a prime member. I guess giving Amazon $100 every year isn't enough to include access to their entire music library, and then they keep sending messages/ads asking you to pay for ""unlimited""."
11858,AmazonMusic,Sophie Walton,5,0,"Best music app i'v'e come across. Much better than google play music. More chooce and a better price. There's no song yet i haven't been able to find. Love this app, If your a music fan then it's a must have xxxx"
11859,AmazonMusic,Christina Kane,3,0,I would've given 5 stars but I HATE that they remove songs from my music and say that song is no longer available. I pay for the music and then they take songs away that I saved to my play lists. Very upsetting.
11860,AmazonMusic,TH3 WEEKND,5,0,"My experience with this app is great , i am from india and in india i cant find any good online song streaming apps that can help me to connect to my XO roots , but this helped . you guys should surely go for it , worth it."
11861,AmazonMusic,lorets gallardo,5,0,"Once I got the music connected to my car it was the best,the music sounds better than I thought it could be. The songs I downloaded takes me back lots of years even better I can listen to the books I got ...."
11862,AmazonMusic,Brian Warren,5,0,"I love all kinds of music. Amazon Music gives me just that; Jazz, Soul, Folk, Blues, Pop, Classical Music and Opera and World Music. To quote Janice "" Oi'l give it foive."""
11863,AmazonMusic,Doug Clark,4,0,"I have found a lot of my favorite music, but it seems that more music is now only available in the unlimited which you have to pay for...I already pay for the Prime membership....smh"
11864,AmazonMusic,Vince C,1,0,"no shuffle similar artist or radio option. hardly works offline. not dependable at all, not all songs or albums available from amazon. seems like pandora and spotify rights are dictating who gets what songs and albums. is it the same with plus?"
11865,AmazonMusic,Dezaree Cruz,1,0,Alexa works when she wants to. Its annoying having to restart the app to get her to respond . And if the app isnt open it doesnt work either. Whats the point? A dead battery ? Pass.
11866,AmazonMusic,Jayesh Varma,1,1,actually its very bad because you can't find all songs here so anyone from amazon is reading these please update your library.some songs are not there for instance 1.blank space by taylor swift 2.many of rahat fateh ali khan 3.arijit singh 4.shahrukh khan and many more please update the same or do us a favour just shutdown these app.
11867,AmazonMusic,Natasja Cabrera,1,2,"keeps shutting down and not working EVERY time I try to play a song. Error message: ""Amazon music keeps stopping"". SEEMING TO NOT BE WORTH MY MONEY ANYMORE."
11868,AmazonMusic,W. Walker,4,0,"It's good until something you want to hear or have saved to your playlist and it's no longer available. Other than that, it's good to have, lots of unexpected talks, artists, and music!"
11869,AmazonMusic,Brent B,3,0,"I like the music on here but have grown frustrated with the fact that previous music, some of my favorite songs/artists which were free to listen before, now require an additional fee."
11870,AmazonMusic,Kelly D,4,0,it is a nice app and works well. there is paywall that prevents me from listening to the latest songs from some of the artists i like. when i want to listen to that i switch to pandora or spotify.
11871,AmazonMusic,Steve Nicks,1,1,"getting tired of downloading songs and Amazon removes them. saying this song is no longer available on Prime. We already pay a lot of money for prime, now the greed is getting to Amazon as they want more money now for music unlimited. Greed kills a lot of large companies. Unlimited should be included with prime like it pretty much used to be,but GREED won't let that happen."
11872,AmazonMusic,A Google user,4,0,"Genuinely great if you have Amazon Prime. Downside: be prepared to be asked weekly if you want to pay extra and upgrade to Unlimited. ""No, and stop f###### asking me"" isn't a response option."
11873,AmazonMusic,Birch tree,4,1,"i mainly use amazon music now and of course, i listen to kpop but the only bad thing is that they dont have stray kids and some other songs from jyp entertainment. to me its not fair that they have ateez's already new album but wont have stray kids' three albums when they debuted last march ðŸ˜¶"
11874,AmazonMusic,NJ GM,4,0,I love that I can listen to entire albums at a whim or create my own playlist. The only thing I don't like so far is the volume. It does not play as loud through my bluetooth speakers as some other music apps.
11875,AmazonMusic,Jamie & Karen Beyer,5,0,use it all the time! I work in healthcare and use it to help patients feel more at ease. I'll ask what station they want and set it for that while I need to complete my procedure. Music therapy helps so much!!!
11876,AmazonMusic,Terry Lowe,5,80,Been using this app with my Prime subscription for some time now. Excellent music catalogue. Great with Alexa at home. On all the time in my house!
11877,AmazonMusic,A Google user,1,0,"Paid for prime and unlimited, it really is awful. when you open the app the wheel turns like it is loading but it does it indefinitely, you have to close and reopen all the time. Will stick with play music."
11878,AmazonMusic,Hannah Gordon,5,0,"Very nicely done ðŸ¤—. I especially appreciate how easy it is to use, even my mom makes her own playlistsðŸ’œ, and I always love finding a special playlist recommended for all life's best (and worst) moments.ðŸ¤Ÿ"
11879,AmazonMusic,An Vu,4,0,"Preferable app for music. Run smoothly most of the times. One thing to improve is to collect top performances from performers, in genres, eras ... Focus on selecting, not only collecting. Had some good time with this app!"
11880,AmazonMusic,Thom Mogo,2,4,less and less music and keeps removing my purchased music if I have not listened to it in a long time. if it comes across a no longer available song it locks up and a new channel need to be selected
11881,AmazonMusic,Bjornis ContentKingSkal,2,0,The only thing good about this app is the trial LOL. Other than that i don't think ill be continuing. This app stops playing albums/playlists after a couple songs.Its super annoying having to continuously open/close app to go back to a song. Spotify #1
11882,AmazonMusic,Ernesto Lopez Jr,3,0,"Music is good overall. However, it is very difficult and/or confusing to create your own playlist that stays in one place. My music has vanished after a certain period of time after having them in the ""cloud"". Music app should be a lot more user friendly and have a wider selection of latin songs/artists. Hence. the 3 stars for this review."
11883,AmazonMusic,SYLVIA,2,0,"The app is hard to navigate and slow. It's really unclear what music is available with a prime membership and what requires the additional paid membership. I keep clicking suggested songs that won't play. The recommendations aren't as good as Pandora either. I've been working to customize my amazon stations, but it just isn't working."
11884,AmazonMusic,Siddharth Mishra,3,1,"Plenty of bugs in the app, keeps on crashing again and again. Music stops everytime you try to open another app. Kindly fix it ASAP."
11885,AmazonMusic,Teresa Krones,5,1,"I love Amazon Music. With the Unlimited, I am able to listen to music everywhere I go. It's so nice for long trips with kids. Alexa works great with it too, where I can use it hands free. I'm a huge fan of Amazon's services and their customer service is awesome for setting up all sorts of devices to it."
11886,AmazonMusic,THEhotTUBriver 13,1,2,it wont download all the songs I paid for onto my phone. and it corrupts the ones that it downloads so you have to listen to your music on the app so it uses up all your data
11887,AmazonMusic,Ann Jones,4,0,what I don't like is how some songs I used to listen to are now not available anymore unless you pay extra for the premium service. They're older songs but now they're worth more? Doesn't make sense.
11888,AmazonMusic,A Google user,3,2,"Great unlimited music library and sound quality, but User interface can be awkward and needs improvements. For example, after an artist search and selection, See All albums ought to be the first pick, then the album's should be in user selectable order, ie original year of release, alphabetical, etc, regardless if remastered, deluxe, extended - just show all editions in series after original album release year, or picking original release drills down. Show track numbers/album in all views"
11889,AmazonMusic,David Rowe,1,2,"They push unlimited non ad music, ask for you banking info, but don't even tell you the price!!! No thanks! if it is a deal tell me. It must not be if you can't find out the price, but they want you to subscribe. BS!"
11890,AmazonMusic,Alen Ivan,3,0,"There are many many songs which I can't find on this app. It's real time you get these songs. Malayalam songs, English classics.. Many are missing. Kindly take this into account and work on it."
11891,AmazonMusic,David Iles,5,1,everything plays well and sounds awesome! Albums just disappeared and reappeared later for no reason. I had to download a different version sometimes.
11892,AmazonMusic,Iyanna Jackson,4,0,it's great but could you please add more kpop songs and have a selection like Spotify? I've been starting to use Spotify more because amazon doesn't have a wide selection of kpop! I use amazon for American music and Spotify for foreign music and i would like to just use one app...
11893,AmazonMusic,Savvas Sidiropoulos,3,0,"You should be able to listen to music you have downloaded when you dont have internet connection every time....hence the whole point of downloading.. As it is now, this feature works only sometimes..."
11894,AmazonMusic,Al David,5,0,I love hearing music from Amazon it's amazing there music you guys got it download the app it's amazing I love doing music getting to hear the songs from your childhood is very special for me so that's why I want you to download that app I hope you enjoy the app thanks for reading my review.
11895,AmazonMusic,desert eagle,4,0,A great variety of music that is easy to search. I like that I can have multiple playlists both on and off line. the only downside is the music rotates and I have had music disappear from my online playlist.
11896,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,"i love listening to the diverse range of artists within the different genres of music, this has helped me so much especially when my anxietyhas been extreme and ive had a panic attack or my depression has been bad, i cant thank amazon enough."
11897,AmazonMusic,chris gonzales,4,0,I like having a lot of options for music and I went this route because I was already a prime member and after having it I went unlimited. the reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars was they updated this app awhile back and now it tries to go online even when I have no signal.
11898,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,"I just love music . I find all my favorite songs on Amazon music . However, I thought Amazon Music was free as long as I stayed with T-mobile. Now I have to look for better options."
11899,AmazonMusic,neyed fonseca,1,1,"very cool app , but not changing rating and will be deleting if it keeps asking me to upgrade my account, when I'm already a subscriber."
11900,AmazonMusic,Hotpocket Moutaindew,5,0,It's like spotify but has more licenced music and is more dependable. Plus it has some audiobooks. Where spotify has some but they are all tucked away as part of a podcast. Here you can just look directly.
11901,AmazonMusic,Ken Young,5,0,"I have listened to quite a few music apps but I prefer Amazon Music over the rest. Easy to use, get what you are looking for, has lyrics with songs, over all good to go!"
11902,AmazonMusic,Ralph Goodson,3,0,App is good except there is no way of stopping the app once you have finished listening. Tapping the X in the corner merely minimises it. The only way to stop it is to force stop!
11903,AmazonMusic,amos larson,1,0,"Great music app, but if ya wanna play music when ya have no service, its worthless. It downloads music to play offline but doesnt load offline. I have other music apps that work perfectly with no service."
11904,AmazonMusic,Van Holloman,5,0,I enjoy this app. It has numerous music choices and artists. I am always finding music that I had forgotten about or new albums of musicians that I hadn't heard from in sometime.
11905,AmazonMusic,Leo Lane,5,0,"I am walking around with the largest music collection I could ever need right in my hand. Whatever song sounds right to me, Amazon Music is ready to play it. The best!"
11906,AmazonMusic,Aakash Joshua,5,0,"This app is great, but it would be really nice if you could add song history in the recent tab like it is available on the ios app. Could you include a song recommendation based on what you listen and download..."
11907,AmazonMusic,Jonathan Bitter,4,1,So far it's been an awesome app I love being able to make my own play lists then if I like the music i can purchase it to keep it on other devices. the randomized feature is by far the best always plays a different song and doesn't get stuck in a small random song group. But I'd say my favorite thing is having access to all my favorite music old and current. looking forward to using it more
11908,AmazonMusic,A Google user,3,0,"I love so much about this app, BUT...restoring a playlist after they are made unavailable is impossible, and some simple codework could fix this inconvenience. i lost so much music that took countless hours to accumulate. so disappointong."
11909,AmazonMusic,Wendy Stowers,2,0,"As a prime user, I don't like the limitations of searching for individual songs, artists, or albums, cause if its not on prime, a lot of times it just won't show up at all. This is fristrating for me, because I don't want to be a unlimited user, and may just be looking to purchase a song, so I'll have to go to Amazons website directly to see that they have it for digital purchase. Another thing I don't like is that they'll take albums off randomly, not just on prime, but amazon music entirely."
11910,AmazonMusic,Himalay Kc,5,0,Superbly awesome music app. with the integration of Alexa it has made it the best music app available all over the world. Here you dont have to find anything... just tell Alexa and she will do the thing for you.
11911,AmazonMusic,Darr Darr,1,0,"disappointing c""mon. Amazon - my phone can play mp3's fine on its own; I am NOT installing another app to use this part of my Prime subscription. This fiasco will be a large factor in my decision to not renew."
11912,AmazonMusic,T.I. Youssef,2,0,"It's okay. Honestly it's annoying that over half the music isn't available unless you upgrade to unlimited. Kinda wish unlimited music was just included in the yearly prime subscription, I'd totally get it then."
11913,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,"I love this app. I am not an apple die-hard and I'm a slightly senior citizen who is new to playlists. This app has made finding and adding upbeat music to my playlist so easy, I actually enjoy my workouts."
11914,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,well I just started with Amazon music but I got the whole family of Amazon variety of apps and I'll tell you I'm only paying for the music app after my free trial and I found my favorite Christian songs and all I had to do is hit play once and in the settings menu you can enjoy going through all the different options I can't get at the one that is first choice for the youngens pick I'm never going back I have 5 Amazon apps for only have to pay for 1 i competitors but I get to play once and now I
11915,AmazonMusic,Bensy Samuel,4,0,I use prime music for kids songs and soundtracks. there seems to be a decent collection but sometimes the tracks are reserved for Unlimited music only. it's still a convenient source to find tracks.
11916,AmazonMusic,A Google user,2,1,"I have Amazon Prime, but still they want an additional subscription to get all content. Nice racket. Otherwise it's okay."
11917,AmazonMusic,Carlos Lopez,2,0,"Current song's aren't up to date. Some song's are blocked. I am paying a yearly fee to listen to song's, and not to be restricted. When that changes I'll change my ratings"
11918,AmazonMusic,Mike Torres,1,1,Worked great on S8. Upgraded to S10 E and now having issues on every device via bluetooth. Slows the song when playing and stops playing the song for a few seconds.
11919,AmazonMusic,Karen Widdowson,4,0,"Like the app overall, but it should be easier to add/remove songs from playlists, and to download specific songs from an album or artist other than doing them all individually. Working with the edit playlist feature is a nightmare on my phone. No info other than partial song title, and no artist shown. Also many albums/songs I've searched for are unavailable, even for purchase."
11920,AmazonMusic,EJT6503,2,0,"Not a big fan of music randomly pausing for no reason and making me have to unlock my phone every time it does to resume the song, or random album covers disappearing, but pretty good otherwise."
11921,AmazonMusic,Raju Gantyal,5,0,superb quality of sound. easy to use .elexa the great. include some a.r rehman south songs
11922,AmazonMusic,Chris Lovewell,5,0,Great app for listening to music. Interface is easy to navigate and the selection is deep. Only issue I have is their recommended artists for me are not the type of music I like.
11923,AmazonMusic,Steve Kittler,5,6,Love the app. easy to use. Downloading music to listen offline is a great feature. Do beware though that sometimes music is taken off Prime for a while so your unable to listen to it but it does come back on. All on all a good app and one I use frequently
11924,AmazonMusic,A Google user,4,0,"I love using Amazon music, my only complaints are sometimes the app seems to time out and it won't play a song and I have to close and reopen the app, and the content is not quite as vast as Apple music."
11925,AmazonMusic,Autumn Koukal,5,0,"Great experience listening to Amazon music. The stations are varied and readily accessible. Finding my favorites, be it song, genre or artist from the search is easy. Wonderful app. I like the offerings they show upon startup. This is Black History month, and I like listening to Whitney and Lionel and Rihanna, and don't own any of the girls' music. Nice to be able to listen to them."
11926,AmazonMusic,Vaderaj Ramarao,4,0,"the search engine needs to improve a lot. if i want to search on a composer or a lyricist, it should have those options in the advanced search options. otherwise, the music collection is quite exhaustive."
11927,AmazonMusic,Bob Lulich,5,0,"I love that they stream everything at 88.2KHz which gives you a higher quality sound. I was on Tidal for that purpose (Tidal also does MQA and for a higher fee, I wish Amazon would offer that) but Tidal is $20 per month and most of their library is CD quality (44.1KHz)"
11928,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,I needed a playlist for winter inside exercise. Cardio and weight work.. Not tech savvy at all. Literally took me 10 minutes.. Anyone one can do it ! No excuses for repetitive music. Enjoy using music without energy for my workouts.
11929,AmazonMusic,A Google user,4,0,"While they don't have every song I would want, they do have enough. It is anoying, though, that some songs can't be played after a while on my playlist, but others can be, and from the same album."
11930,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,I love the spa music for my professional massage business and love the artists offered. It creates a better atmosphere and experience for my clients to unwind and relax during their session. Thanks Amazon Music.
11931,AmazonMusic,Aalok Gokhale,4,0,very much happy and look forward to using it every time a new song/album is released. the only complaint is YRF music label songs can not be seen. nothing else and that is the reason not a 5 * rating.
11932,AmazonMusic,Mark Davisson,5,0,I really like how the ocean sounds keep me calm and helps my mind to relax so I'm able to to resolve complex problems doing my job. The praise and worship music stations have songs that speak to the core of my being drawing me ever closer to the God I love.
11933,AmazonMusic,Juan Rosa,5,0,I love my Amazon Music App! I travel a lot and being able to download music for offline play is excellent. If you are a Prime member you have access to this great music app. Get It!! You won't be sorry.
11934,AmazonMusic,Caden Smith,4,1,Good deal if you already have Amazon Prime. They have most music but i have found few albums and songs that they are definitely missing. The interface is ok. there are some buttons that dont really do what they say they do. (on androind at least) other than that everything works really well and i use it everyday.
11935,AmazonMusic,Javy Dom,4,0,"Prime member for over 10 years, Amazon music is a nice perk just wish we would get the unlimited since I'm already paying over 100 dollars a year. Don't see why I need to pay for extra for ""unlimited"""
11936,AmazonMusic,Sarah Logan,3,0,Takes a while to get used to. Especially finding playlist you've made but once worked out its good. Limited music compared to Spotify though unless you want to pay. However not sure why but sound seems so much better.
11937,AmazonMusic,Kim Curry,3,6,"It depends on what you want to use it for. I have had good experiences with purchasing digital music (albums and singles), and as a Prime member have enjoyed commercial-free playlists to listen while I work. Developing my own playlists from a combination of purchased and Prime music has been clunky. On a small-ish phone, selecting a song or album too easily navigates away. It is slow to add albums. It is too easy for a playlist to be wiped empty when trying to remove just 1 or 2 songs."
11938,AmazonMusic,Leigh Ann White,4,8,"I love the unlimited so that we can share and listen at the same time as a family. the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because songs that I put on my playlists become unavailable and then I can no longer listen to them. I understand there have to be permissions/ rights for this music to be on Amazon, it's just a bummer down songs I already had on playlists are removed."
11939,AmazonMusic,Anjay Thakur,5,2,"great app. so easy to find the song and one can also download it to the phone. with Alexa voice command, it is a breeze to find any song"
11940,AmazonMusic,Brian Harrison,3,0,"Amazon Music could be so much better. The playlists are very limited, and last only about 30 minutes. It would be better to have channels from which we can select, without paying more."
11941,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,2,its just brilliant. I pay for my whole family only 14.99 in British pounds and 6 members including me are using it. Brilliant just brilliant any music any artist on demand (at least anything that i have browsed was there). you can create playlist and Alexa is very helpful.
11942,AmazonMusic,bebe ori,4,0,love the sound quality. best sound quality of all the music apps. my only issue is how some music suddenly becomes unavailable even after you've downloaded them to your device.
11943,AmazonMusic,Twameka Kumar,3,0,"It is quite a good platform to stream music, although it doesn't have all songs/album... currently for some reason it is not working...saying it is unable to stream songs!"
11944,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,Amazon Music App is perfect for when you need music on the go. Relaxing to play when you stressed. You can create playlists to match your mood. Especially love piano guys.
11945,AmazonMusic,Tiffany Thompson,4,0,"I LOVE Amazon Music. As a Prime member, it would be nice to have multiple devices stream at the same time without having the Unlimited. That is the reason I only gave 4 stars."
11946,AmazonMusic,Michelle M Swanson,2,0,Sometimes difficult to navigate. Often stored and offline music is randomly 'not available at this time.' Amazon music would be better if it had some real competition.
11947,AmazonMusic,Chirag Sawarn,5,0,Thou the layout is pretty thin it has a massive catalogue of songs. Why isn't cigarettes after sex on it? Well if you have a few songs which aren't on the catalogue this app allows you to play songs already on your device which are pirated or whatever unlike Spotify. It's still rare to find songs that it doesn't have. I'd also like to highlight that the search is sloppy. You really need to write better code for the search Amazon. Here's 5 starts coz its free with Prime subscription. cheers
11948,AmazonMusic,Maureen Howard,5,0,once I had managed to get the hang of how it all worked it has been fantastic. I am not at all technical minded so needed to wait for my son to visit. once you know what you are doing it is very straightforward.
11949,AmazonMusic,Cheryl Lauer,4,0,"Love that I can find ANY song ever made and create my own playlists! Don't like that the app keeps changing certain features, such as in app volume control which disappeared several months ago. Also, now, the time counter in each song has disappeared. Not sure why the programmers have to keep messing with these useful features."
11950,AmazonMusic,Shirley Craig,5,0,"Favorite place to go almost every day cleaning house or working outside in the yard, volunteering at fire company functions and many more times throughout my week. Thank you Amazon."
11951,AmazonMusic,Elizabeth Martinez,4,0,"Great selection of music, would give it a 5 star but not all songs are available. You have to pay extra for unlimited access, I already have prime and I was bummed to read that. overall it's great!"
11952,AmazonMusic,Ebony Boyd,5,0,i decided to go ahead and purchase music Available as a perk with my Amazon Prime...genuinely true Ebony karaoke is a whole nother genre you would have to have specific equipment for karaoke and you would have to have specific instrumentals for karaoke with backups that would have to come into the works in the future so they asked me if it offered karaoke and those are my thoughts I love surveys
11953,AmazonMusic,John Adams,5,0,"Really enjoy the suggested playsets. I've discovered artists and songs that I wouldn't normally hear, some I prefer over the more generic radio offerings. My family likes the access we all get through the multi user program."
11954,AmazonMusic,Lewin Sivamalai,4,1,I love the Tamil song collection they have. Some peppy Telugu and Hindi numbers are there too. I have not heard the rest but I am OK with this set for now. In fact I have subscribed to Amazon prime for their music and shopping and not for their movie/series. Hope keep building their collection.
11955,AmazonMusic,Kathy Mullins,5,0,"It works great, and is easy to use. Sound is great on my LG G5 phone, and has a clarity that sounds pure and clean; with bluetooth speaker, would rock the house! Amazon Prime member n lovin' it!!"
11956,AmazonMusic,brandon milanes,5,2,I love that the music plays louder than some other music apps so that's greatly appreciated. My only complaint is even though my songs are downloaded sometimes they buffer sometimes offline or not. please fix
11957,AmazonMusic,Vishal Thale,4,0,After the update the app is not able to play offline songs!! on moto g5s plus oreo. hope they fix this. and it would be great if an in app equilizer was added even a 5 band could do bcauz some of the phones dont have one inbuilt :(
11958,AmazonMusic,Gabe Scavone,2,0,I wish they would expand their music selection. What they have is good but it could be great. I also notice there are some tunes that are NOT from original artists!! so for that I'm giving a 2 star!
11959,AmazonMusic,Francis Turano,5,0,i listen to all different genres. i find 99% of my favorite music here. highly recommend it and having the paid service. no signal areas? no problem when your music is saved in your phone.
11960,AmazonMusic,ordinanceguard,1,0,"Why in the hell should I pay for unlimited when I have prime? Everyone with prime was already supposed to have ""unlimited"" music. taking something someone paid for and charging them again for it is theft."
11961,AmazonMusic,Mark Stewart,5,0,I love this app. Every song that I ever wanted to listen to so far is in Amazon's catalog. It has helped me find music that I might not have been able to hear about otherwise. Definitely a plus if you have a Prime membership.
11962,AmazonMusic,j Meg,1,1,The app works fine on my first usage. Then it keeps crashing on launch every time I open for second time. I need to delete app and reinstall e every time.
11963,AmazonMusic,Joe Biggie,5,0,"Love the app. 30 day free trial as well. Can download songs, but must play them through the app, which is ok I guess. 50 million+ songs. That oughtta do it... Overall enjoying Amazon Music."
11964,AmazonMusic,Patrick Ray,1,1,"Spend 2 hours loading a playlist, then it disappears. I'm paying money for that? I'll be going back to Google music app"
11965,AmazonMusic,The Petersons,2,0,Don't like that some music is only accessible by paying for Amazon unlimited. I should be allowed to purchase one song if that's all I want. I'm guessing it a contractual thing.
11966,AmazonMusic,Alphonse Lavallee,2,0,"I love my music. I like the idea of streaming it non stop commercial free. I Hate that my Amazon music app buffers non stop, loses connectivity ( and I have wifi in my vehicle ) , it stops to ask if I'm still listening!!!!! I drive 8 hours a day and play Amazon Most days when it works.... otherwise I'm listening to radio. That makes me feel like Amazon is a useless app."
11967,AmazonMusic,Rich Chickens,4,1,"I'm quite heavily invested in the Amazon infrastructure/content thing now; this service integrates nicely wirh my echo devices and AV amp. The only gripe I had about the app was that it was starting to do random stuff with the track order of albums. These were entirely online albums (i.e. not my own playlists) - in desperation I went into settings and clicked Storage>Clear Cache, which seems to have solved the problem."
11968,AmazonMusic,Conor Thornton,4,0,"Great addition to Amazon prime, not super thrilled that after paying for prime they want you to pay for prime unlimited, which has like 5x the music of prime music, but it's still a great addition. Would be 5 stars if they included more music. Most of my favorite artists have like 15 albums locked into unlimited, but usually their best songs are in prime music. Sucks when you type in an artist and you see you need prime unlimited to see all their content. I look at it as an added bonus."
11969,AmazonMusic,Greg S,1,2,"choppy audio, get it fixed. other apps streaming audio on the same phone don't have the same problem, battery saving disabled."
11970,AmazonMusic,Caffeine Bobomb,4,2,"Great app but ""Unlimited"" still seems to have very limited selections on some artists / albums. My main issue is the album order constanly being shuffled. I don't want it to do this as is ruins the listening experience of a lot of albums. No idea how to turn this off even after Googling! Other than that, all good."
11971,AmazonMusic,sukhvir virdi,1,1,my Amazon prime music aap is not working since two months despite of contact to customer care. It is a worst music aap i have experience so far. I give negative (not zero) stars if possible.
11972,AmazonMusic,Robin Rajan,5,0,Easy to use inthitive interface which is so good i use it instead of google play for my library songs!! Very good colletion of latest music!! and i mean the latest!! the album drops in USA and on the app at the same time!!!
11973,AmazonMusic,H L,4,4,Purchased music shows up on every device linked to the account EXCEPT the device is was purchased from. Not cool! Used to work great now it's extremely frustrating. UPDATE...After an app update this issue is fixed so we cool now!
11974,AmazonMusic,Ian C,2,1,"some basic features missing such as ""add to queue"". interface is inconsistent in behaviour. edit 28/0319 giving up on this service as there appears to be no movement to improve it. Casting to Alexa is very unreliable ( Surely one thing that Amazon should get right?), basic queue functionality still missing. Heading back to Spotify"
11975,AmazonMusic,Deepan Kumar,1,3,Super slow! Very glitchy. Takes ages for the app to load and I think this app is slowing down my phone too. Was good when it got launched though! Shame!
11976,AmazonMusic,Lance McFadden,4,0,For the most part this app works quite well. i use it in place of the Android music player for all my music now. I will give it 5 stars if they add an equalizer and improve the layout of the music controls.
11977,AmazonMusic,Stephen McWhinnie,4,0,"Good App for buying music to keep. Just wish it would stop asking me to start a paid for subscription every time I use it. I've already paid for the music i listen to, stop bugging me with ads."
11978,AmazonMusic,A Google user,1,1,"Play back is horrible at best. I'm going back to Google play unfortunately. They both suck, but at least i can listen to music on Google."
11979,AmazonMusic,A Google user,3,0,"I really enjoy Amazon Music, unfortunately it doesn't have all the latest and greatest so I upgraded to Amazon Unlimited. What I love about it, is any song I'm looking for I just enter it in search and it pops up, my dislikes are you can't stream music on more than one device unless you pay more $, it should include at minimum 2 devices; Another dislike is that even if your music is downloaded or saved, It isn't available to play any longer,.!? It should also have folders to organize playlists."
11980,AmazonMusic,Nine Johnson,3,0,They are cool. but they try to get you to pay even more to here certain newely released music as if it can't be heard elsewhere. Plus I don't respect a service that tells you what rating to give them.
11981,AmazonMusic,Linda Levy,3,0,"the app is OK......but I'm having a hard time figuring out how to find things. I want to be able to just look at music in certain genres, but I just get frustrated and look it up by the artist which does not give me everything I'm looking for."
11982,AmazonMusic,Abigail Reine,4,0,"I love Amazon Music. One critique, I don't like when they remove songs stating that it's no longer available in Amazon, but then you find it and have to download it again. It becomes annoying"
11983,AmazonMusic,Jason Vandermeulen,2,0,"I pay for amazon prime and this app is""included"". However i am limited to a small selection of songs unless i buy premium! I already payed amazon for the app. I also found the app is very difficult to maneuver."
11984,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,"I'm 66 years old And this app was very easy to use and they had all the music I was intrested in. With my headset on no one has a clue then I'm listening to AC/DC and Nirvana ,enjoy."
11985,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,the music it's okay for main stream artists or groups something out of the norm like Bruce Hornsby Natalie Cole stuff like that is hard to find another group Brighton beat the sad thing is once you go on an apple apple has a lot more variety in a lot of no-name groups
11986,AmazonMusic,Victor Valenzuela,2,0,"The app became useless. It used to just lag constantly all the time, now it kicks me out of the app every 10 seconds. Going back to Spotify, never should have left."
11987,AmazonMusic,Rosemarie Walker,4,0,"I received my first Amazon music gift from my kids around 2011. The rest is history. I love my Amazon Music. I carry it with me everywhere. The only thing I was hurt about was when I was offered Amazon Music downloads free one time and when I didn't choose to keep it, they took all of the music back. Other than that, I'm pleased"
11988,AmazonMusic,Erin Chapin,5,0,"has all the music I've searched for, I really enjoy the ability to download so I can listen without internet connection. once you figure out how to navigate it, it's pretty easy to use. worth it!"
11989,AmazonMusic,Srivatsa Rao,1,1,1 lists call recordings even though .nomedia file present in the recording s folder. 2 when internet is enabled in the device and then if we use offline mode playback very sluggish.i hope devs take look at these production blocker issues
11990,AmazonMusic,envyincages,5,0,"Like the music and availability. However, sometimes I buy albums only to find that they have been erased off my memory card then I cannotv re load without paying for album again. I don't understand this.,"
11991,AmazonMusic,Mike Kerley,5,0,"Great if you want to play your favourite Album or just listen to the 80's 90's ect compilations. This just comes with your Amazon prime so you can watch on a smart TV or iPad, mobile. Worth the cost ( cheaper paying for 1 year )"
11992,AmazonMusic,Juan Cuello Espinosa,3,0,"very similar selection to spotify, but lacks that app's ability to sync playlists on any device that had spotify open and connected to the same account. you apparently need an alexa-enabled device, which is very limiting. however I like the scrubbing feature"
11993,AmazonMusic,A Google user,3,1,"Messy interface, hard to find what you want. First screen displays what is popular or what is being marketed, not what you are interested in."
11994,AmazonMusic,Erick M,4,0,User friendly! Easy to search and navigate! I enjoy the variety of recommendations. Every once in awhile songs will state no longer available after I have already downloaded and then reappear.
11995,AmazonMusic,Jennifer Pewterbaugh,5,0,I love that i can download and listen to the music offline at any time. They are frequemtly sending me notifications of new music i may like and have been spot-on each time. highly recommend.
11996,AmazonMusic,A Google user,1,2,"Raging,this app has deleted all my play lists,not impressed at all. Some of these songs were really special,a memory of my mum."
11997,AmazonMusic,LaJoyce E Allen,3,0,I pay for Amazon prime and they still want more money for music? not cool. plus they get rid of songs that u have in your playlist because you're not paying extra for music... that's not 5 star service.
11998,AmazonMusic,David Schneider,5,0,"As a Prime member, I very much enjoy the wide variety of music, playlists and ease of use of this application. Whether I need music for focus, or something to pick up my energy it is available."
11999,AmazonMusic,ketan rade,1,1,Worst ....totally worst If i have to fullfill my adress pincode mobile no and other private info .just to listen music...what the.....did the stock music player not working or jio net cant download music ???
12000,AmazonMusic,Jon Coley,1,0,Amazon music used to be good until they stripped it down and then forced an additional 7.99 per month fee to get the same material back. It's pretty sad that prime members who pay 120$ a year now have access to only half of what they did 2-3 years ago
12001,AmazonMusic,Summer Sorcha,4,0,upset i purchased music and it's not showing up on my playlist..i tried everything to fix it but still nothing...tried to contact customer service but you just get the run-around...so basically im screwed.
12002,AmazonMusic,Laura Meyer,4,7,"love the app, but recently getting a lot of ""playback errors"", saying it can't play certain songs. Also, would be nice if we could stream on 2 devices at a time. We already pay prime membership - don't feel like we should have to pay for Music Unlimited, too."
12003,AmazonMusic,Matt Moser,1,0,love having the music and unlimited skips but the fact that it tells me I've been away from the app a long time and stops my music drives me insane. I have a bit of a longer commute and the message popping up and stopping the music kills it for me.
12004,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,"I LOVE this app. I listen to a lot of music at home, work, walking the dogs etc, so having this catalogue at my finger tips is great. Easy and fast to use..highly recommended..."
12005,AmazonMusic,Scott S,2,0,"My opinion is when you pay a high price for a service, you enjoy quality and value. NOT here with this app. It is mediocre at best, so after the free trial this app will be deleted. Too bad..."
12006,AmazonMusic,Lisa Bober,4,0,"I love the app, only I think when you pay for Prime, the whole catalog should be accessible instead of limiting what you can listen to, and wanting you to pay more per month to hear it all."
12007,AmazonMusic,Paul Hummel,3,0,"Slow. I liked it about 5 yrs ago. I buy music, and try to download it but it's nowhere to be found. Rinse, repeat until it shows up. Confusing. Now a nag message about prime music."
12008,AmazonMusic,Amy McLaughlin,4,0,I love my amazon music. I appreciate having access to all the music I love even if I don't have that music with me. I also love being able to look up anything I hear that I like by song or artist. Would love for more music to be available for free.
12009,AmazonMusic,Kelly Curdie,4,0,"app is easy to use, and music is great, however the stations can be repetitive. so when I hear the same song play for the 3rd time in an hour it can be a bit annoying. Other then that I use it daily."
12010,AmazonMusic,Delanie Fillingame,5,0,"Awesome variety of music I've seen so far! The music still plays in the background while you continue on with other apps! You can even take a picture,and the music keeps playing! I don't know why I didn't download this sooner!"
12011,AmazonMusic,Heather Burnett,3,0,"I love Amazon but your music app needs a lot of work. Such as creating a sort feature to sort by artist, add date, etc. That's common sense. And reordering your songs in your Playlist is tedious and unfriendly."
12012,AmazonMusic,Mara Mandell,5,0,"I really love this app. Cx apple music. Who needs it? Gave spotify a try but cancelled that as well. Why pay for those subs when you can get gr8 music free. Wondering why a few songs no longer available, but still free is free"
12013,AmazonMusic,A Google user,4,2,Really love the variety of music. The only complaint I have is sometimes the songs I've added to a playlist will suddenly move to Unlimited and I can't listen to them anymore.
12014,AmazonMusic,Ernesto DePaule,5,5,"The restful music and nature sounds were really helpful and enjoyable. That was my first regular use of this program. I am now exploring music that I used to love, but haven't listened to for a while. The number of remastered versions of those recordings has been amazing, along with demos and additional tracks of those albums. This has rekindled my interest in listening to even more recordings, and now enjoy it immensely."
12015,AmazonMusic,abhishek goel,4,0,Why the mobile app did not remove those files from My music tab when i have deleted those files from SD CARD or phone memory. it continues to show dissolved entry and music stops there sayinf doesn't exist. Why its not getting updated??
12016,AmazonMusic,Scott Rollins,5,0,"Good selection of music and the app never fails. I use playlists for my daily running sessions, even when traveling all over the US without any issues. Highly recommended."
12017,AmazonMusic,Andy Jackson,2,0,"I have started using this app due to getting an Alexa. Love the Alexa but i hate this app. It is nowhere near as user friendly as Spotify which i have used for a long time. It also constantly fails to load an album and just sits there with the spinning circle and no tracks. Disappointing, really would have expected a much better app from Amazon. I was much happier paying for Spotify than Amazon music."
12018,AmazonMusic,Nicole Martin,4,0,"easy to use, and can find a large variety of music fir free. You do need to pay for the current music, but for me the *free version is good enough to get me through my long runs"
12019,AmazonMusic,Stephanie Bott,4,0,"I reallty enjoy listening to the music, especially things I don't get elsewhere. Suggestion for 1950s music:. add""Volare,"" which was very popular then."
12020,AmazonMusic,sammyhaddad,5,0,I love it while Im enjoying my 30 day free trial. Free Pandora is way better than free Amazon Music. Stiil havent figured out what they want $7.99 for. Oh yeah multiple devices. WOW!
12021,AmazonMusic,Valerie Bumpers,2,0,used to love this app but lately it always stops after playing a song or 2. I have to constantly go back to the app and restart the music. Very irritating!!@
12022,AmazonMusic,Aniruddh Guddi,5,0,"i discontinued my other music subscriptions as this has the most extensive library i have ever come across. however, curated playlists could be introduced to make it much better. it supports Android auto as well but not Android tv."
12023,AmazonMusic,William Nash,2,0,"Way too many ads in this app for me and I don't need, desire or want anyone's recommendations because I know categorical what I want and or don't want to listen to, otherwise it is a good app."
12024,AmazonMusic,Pete S.,1,0,I miss the days when this was a music player and not an advertisement that plays music. Update: it doesn't even play music anymore. Each version has gotten worse and worse. Amazon has become Microsoft.
12025,AmazonMusic,Sam Smith,5,0,"This is a great app. I am old, so many of my songs are from the 90s (not rock) and included with prime. I prefer soft jazz and lyrical songs by women with a great beat - dance."
12026,AmazonMusic,John Cappo,4,3,"I enjoy the app and my kids find it easy to use, especially with the Echo. The only drawback is easily creating playlists on your own. They can be made but are time intensive and the app doesn't mitigate that issue."
12027,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,3,"Incredible bargain! I can make a playlist from millions of songs, but why should I? There are so many playlists and stations already, and Amazom Music is constantly adding more. This is my CD quality streaming source."
12028,AmazonMusic,Haniff G7,1,0,"I keep having difficulty downloading all of the songs I purchase on this app to my device on Google Play Music,so even though they're downloaded on my Online Music,for whatever reason,they're not showing up on my Offline Music and I have absolutely no idea how to do so. Plus to add injury to insult,I was requested to upgrade the app,which I did and now it's not evening opening. ðŸ˜ VERY frustrating."
12029,AmazonMusic,Andrew Wolfe,4,4,it's a really good ap I can listen to just about anything I want to and non of the stuff I don't. the only complaint I have is it can take some time for some artists to appear and even longer if at all for the lyrics to appear as well. most really popular artists albums do show on the day of release though.
12030,AmazonMusic,C L,4,0,"This app is good, as long as music doesn't disappear for no apparent reason. Several times I have gone into the app and all but the same two or three songs have disappeared. When I search for a reason, the only thing I find is that this is some kind of glitch (Amazon, please fix!). It is very frustrating when I then need to spend an hour or two trying to re-download alllll of my music for offline listening. This of course is usually discovered in the car, where I have no immediate recourse."
12031,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,"This is the best app ever invented!! It can play any song immediately. If you think of a song you haven't heard in 20 years, you just ask Alexa to play it and you're listening to it in 3 seconds. I remember the days of trying to find a song on a cassette tape where you would have to fast forward stop it listen to it that's not it, fast forward stop listen, went too far, rewind. I love this app more than anything ever! I don't see how I can ever live without it!. Joe Mendoza"
12032,AmazonMusic,Megan Wegehoft,1,0,"I used to be very happy with this app, but with recent updates the ""listen offline"" mode has stopped working at all!! I should not have to restart the app every other song or have it fail to play any song due to ""lack of internet connection"" when I am specifically playing songs downloaded to my SD card and the listening mode switched to offline. This is a basic and necessary function for any music app (hello, plane rides anyone?!!), and until it is fixed I would not recommend this app to anyone."
12033,AmazonMusic,Runthejewels,5,0,"Extensive list. My playlist has every song I love, even remixes. Sound is clearer than any music app I've subscribed to. The price is good too, considering you can listen on multiple devices."
12034,AmazonMusic,Drunken Records,5,0,If it is possible can you please add the artists section in the offline section. Having songs from different albums of the same artists creates confusion and problems. Thanking you in advance.
12035,AmazonMusic,albo85juan,4,0,The app is by far the most user friendly music player for android (even better than Google's music player). I only wish the PC and the mobile app cound sync. As far as I know they don't.
12036,AmazonMusic,Rick,2,0,"App continually freezes and stops playing, for no reason. I have scoured the Internet for answers, and many people have the same problem. The music selection is fantastic, but the app is not good."
12037,AmazonMusic,Triton26,4,0,"It's great for listening to somgs if you have Amazon Prime, but the amount of free songs is a bit limited. Also tends to do weird stuff but noting a quick force stop and restart can't solve. Pretty good."
12038,AmazonMusic,Shubham Nanda,4,0,"Quality of music is really superb, best but collection of songs are limited. Many of the old and latest songs are missing on Prime Music, please make them available here as well. Play Next, if would be added, it would be great for listeners like me so that I can instruct the alexa or manually to play any song next automatically by adding it in the queue next to it."
12039,AmazonMusic,Michele Walsvick,5,0,I live Amazon Music. They have anything and EVERYTHING you would want. I listen to Amazon music everyday all day while I am at work. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!!!
12040,AmazonMusic,Terry Pozyski,5,2,"Amazon music is the best devive I have ever added to my smartphone. I can enjoy the jatd rock of the 70's and 80's always. I dont have to listen to the music of the todays generation, that is not very good I guess that you can call me just an old headbanger from the 1980's, but this app is the best ever. Thanks AMAZON !!! 5 â­â­â­â­â­"
12041,AmazonMusic,John Crosby,4,0,An almost perfect music experience. The only improvement I could suggest is using lossless compression algorithms on the recorded content. The difference is audible for me.
12042,AmazonMusic,Kristi Arnot,2,0,Most of the music I'd like to listen to is only available with unlimited. It's like my ever-increasing prime membership just isn't enough--pay $7.99 more per month. No thanks.
12043,AmazonMusic,Brennan Higgins,2,2,"this app has always been extremely glitchy and the latest iteration is no different. not sure what their latest update was but now it crashes upon launch... great catalog and reasonably good quality streaming, but the glitches from a company like Amazon and their endless billions are truly unacceptable"
12044,AmazonMusic,Tommy Mauldin,5,0,music you can choose from different era's. my wife and I sit on the porch every afternoon and listen to different types of music and music of different decades. great selection. thanks
12045,AmazonMusic,Paul Greaves,4,0,We need a 'Sin Bin' option for over played songs. place a song in the sin bin if you're hearing a song too much and it can be released back after a given period to your playlist/app.
12046,AmazonMusic,Jacky Benbow,4,0,Got this as part of the Prime package. Previously had spotify. i am disappointed with the app for the following reasons. it is erratic. sometimes it stops playing because ive received an email or message. Tunes i have added to my playlist no longer play as they're no longer prime but prime +. Tunes of original artist's are often cut short. add to this Amazon prime tv usually says we have insufficient band width. Yet we don't hsve problems with any other media source.
12047,AmazonMusic,Brehvon,3,0,The app is just fine until it doesn't recognize new music and you have to clear app data to fix it... Kinda annoying. Resource-heavy while playing music. 4.5 stars if this wasn't an issue.
12048,AmazonMusic,R. R.,5,0,"lots of use on this app over the last 2 years. the years dont always show on the album and sometimes theyre out order if you're going for a discography, but very strong selection. even lyrics in a lot of cases!"
12049,AmazonMusic,Paul Devereux,5,0,This app is great for finding new music. You only have to put in a few of your favourite songs and it suggests more for you to listen to. You can make playlists as well as download or purchase songs.
12050,AmazonMusic,Carl bell,2,0,"Still not working hands free, phone goes to sleep after a minute rendering Alexa useless so cant use while driving which is where I use it mostly. please fix this as it's a great app apart from that or my subscription will be getting cancelled soon."
12051,AmazonMusic,Devang Sethi,4,6,"Amazing app! The main highlight is probably the presence of curated playlists be it of a specific artist or a genre. Searching can be made better. For example, while looking for a certain song it doesn't necessarily show the original album version in the top results. Other than that this app is a delight to use."
12052,AmazonMusic,stephen pauley,2,0,"Decent selection. But I have purchased songs and then they get grayed out and have no access to them. I understand when Amazon loses rights, but I purchased them and customer service was no help."
12053,AmazonMusic,Isaac w,2,0,great when it works. Its a nice part of prime benefit. I feel it has gone down hill since the introduction of the premium app. for what a guy pays for prime membership it could be better.
12054,AmazonMusic,Justin Donley,4,0,"Good selection, easy to navigate. I like that the lyrics are available for majority of the songs. App sometimes just quits and songs occassionally become unavailable and have to be downloaded again."
12055,AmazonMusic,Linda G.,3,0,"Pretty good for the most part, except that sometimes I will have a song saved in my music, and then randomly it takes it away and changes it to one I have to pay for as part of the subscription service."
12056,AmazonMusic,A Google user,3,0,"Good player, good selection. Needs itunes integration to either play or download the music and play lists we already own on other services. (I know this will never be reinstated but it should be)"
12057,AmazonMusic,Xenia RK,4,0,"easy to navigate and good suggestions and lists based on taste. it has decent variety of music, but wish it had even more. For example, very limited alternatives in other languages."
12058,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,2,Love this app all my music in one place. Can download whenever I please for Â£9.99 a month. Recommend to music lovers.
12059,AmazonMusic,A Google user,4,0,"Need to add some more features to discover songs,,i prefer you to understand it from your compititers ,i am not complaining ,,but it has much more room for improvement"
12060,AmazonMusic,Eric Desmarais,3,0,"the app itself performs like all the other music apps. no commercials is nice. cheif complaint is the gap in artist availability between this app and the premium version, which is also very expensive."
12061,AmazonMusic,fnaf cosplay,1,1,"I had it before on my tablet,now i have it on my phone and its saying the hole app is premium,it hurts cause i used to love this app."
12062,AmazonMusic,Myles Williams,4,0,I like. I got prime for the free shipping and got movies and music as well included. My Netflix is just movies etc and price has gone up twice in 3 months. now I pay more than prime and get all these other goodies.. Gota love it from my standpoint. Keep it up guys. Even on the streaming there is so much stuff if you dig for it. So much to choose from. Prime gives me HD 1080p while Netflix is SD 720p or less unless I want to pay extra for HD1080P
12063,AmazonMusic,Abhishek Ks,2,0,"Need more developments in the app, such as a separate artist's list and lot more... just like gaana and Jio saavnðŸ‘ and even the downloading and listening offline is not precise or it more clumsy to say... Hope that it will be done soon"
12064,AmazonMusic,Alekai Don,1,0,"My songs are constantly removed from Amazon's catalogues and then I have to manually re-add them but with a different album cover. It's one of the most annoying things with this app and it happens daily. Trying to change the order of songs in your play queue just results in a slow, almost-laggy animation. Whole app just feels outdated. What a shame."
12065,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,"I absolutely loved the app, until one day when I opened my playlist and so many of my songs were all gone. Initially I was really impressed by the application until so many of my songs were gone."
12066,AmazonMusic,Shankar Sharma,3,0,Dont like you have to buy Unlimited to listen to some tracks. Prime used to have all the songs. now you have to pay extra $$$$ to listen to your favorite songs. Sucks!!!
12067,AmazonMusic,A Google user,1,10,"Worst music app I've ever used. Constantly freezes and crashes, frequently fails to load music in the store, and sometimes even in offline. Playback frequently stops for no reason at all."
12068,AmazonMusic,Delphyn Sauls,5,1,"LOVE THIS MUSIC STREAMING APP!! IVE FOUND EVERY SONG, ARTIST, SOUNDTRACK I SEARCHED FOR AND HAVE BEEN ABLE TO LISTEN EVEN IF I GO OFFLINE! AMAZING SOUND QUALITY AND FEATURES! AMAZON NEVER CEASES TO AMAZE ME!"
12069,AmazonMusic,A Google user,1,3,app makes my phone heat up to almost untouchable temperatures. I have even had an error message on my phone pop up and tell me to shut it down for too much CPU usage.
12070,AmazonMusic,Tessa Morris,3,0,"I love the access to music and don't mind that some things are specifically for unlimited members. My issue is with how often the app is glitching. It happens pretty much every time I first open the app and try to play something. I have to restart and then after picking a playlist or song to start listening to, I can't see anything and sometimes cannot change songs. I love the music app in general but until this is fixed, it's not as convenient as the apps that come standard on my phone."
12071,AmazonMusic,Trevor Beer,3,4,"Decent. Has a wide variety of music and a good amount of underground artist. Biggest problem I have is the stations or playlists. If your listening to a hard rock playlist or even metal you shouldn't have to skip a bunch of love songs and mushy stuff. and its not just the hard rock or metal, I've noticed a bunch of out of place songs while listening to stations or playlists."
12072,AmazonMusic,Brandon Bilanzich,5,0,"It's great! I love to hear the music I want to hear. Pretty uch like prime video, but for music. If you love music, but you're sick of the same old S#$â™¤! This is perfect you!"
12073,AmazonMusic,Lukas Best,3,0,"I wish Amazon did not take songs away. I have made playlists, and then gone back to discover that a third of the songs are no longer available unless I buy Premium. It's frustrating."
12074,AmazonMusic,S M,1,0,"Considering its a paid for service, its not up to scratch. Not enough track details or album detail. Suggestions not very good. Some Fav songs not there. Sticking to another app which has everything on it. Ytm"
12075,AmazonMusic,Aaron Mundell,2,0,keeps login me out. have to sign in everytime. needs an internet connection even if u want to use dowmloaded music. spotify app is better!!! spotify can be used with no internet connection. spotify is easier to doenload and play music.
12076,AmazonMusic,LaRon Taylor,3,0,"it's great and I would love to give it 4 stars but you dont have the music I want!!! simple albums. but I know why, the artist. but it's ok other than that, its it's great."
12077,AmazonMusic,Jason Fisher,4,2,"The app works well and the music selection is good. My one gripe is that the app refuses to close sometimes, which is annoying to me."
12078,AmazonMusic,Franco Gallinaro,5,0,"I'm very satisfied with the selection of music, hands-free Alexa options, and playback features! What more could one want or need in a music streaming app!"
12079,AmazonMusic,Teresa Ricketts,5,3,Great app but sometimes music you add to My Music is still listed but no longer available on Amazon Music. Maybe a notification saying that some titles in your music library is no longer available would be great. Other than that I love this app!
12080,AmazonMusic,H.M. Jordan,3,0,"it'd be really great if i could play offline songs and recognized that I allowed every permission possible, instead of continuously popping up with ""update permissions"" despite me updating them a hundred times and a dozen reboots already."
12081,AmazonMusic,Brian Doyle,1,0,Very buggy app. Click on a song in the search results and it won't play. Can't clear the persistent notification even when no music is playing and the app is closed.
12082,AmazonMusic,Joaquin Singer,1,0,For some reason it the music bass tones are not working. I've tested other music apps and my headphones and this is just a problem of this App. Perhaps a file compression issue?
12083,AmazonMusic,dog faced,1,0,"Terrible user interface. Can't just pick an artist and have it play like music. I normally like Amazon for everything, but YouTube, Pandora, and Spottify are easier to use."
12084,AmazonMusic,michael salomskas,5,0,right on time ....I got tired of other apps and my physical collection slowing me down having to change records or make playlists while I work ....and this comes along ....I ABSOLUTELY need my music to work so thanks amazon music for some motivation
12085,AmazonMusic,Ruben Bhattacharya,1,11,Horrible search function. Have to type exactly the correct song name . Sometimes people don't remember the exact name of an old song. The search should be flexible. Please improve it if possible.
12086,AmazonMusic,Buddy Floyd,4,2,"good selection of music and performers. only issue is that an update or something elimatef all of my free downloaded songs and i had to go back and download those again. also created charges which I think occurred after downloads. nothing is free, as the saying goes."
12087,AmazonMusic,A Google user,3,0,continually is redownloading music I already have on my phone. Keeps trying to trick me into getting Prime with popups during normal operation. Go to switch a song and suddenly the popup is there as you go to hit the song you want.
12088,AmazonMusic,infuriated troopa,4,0,"Very good. Only changed I'd make is the ability to include/exclude folders that need to be accessed. Example, choosing offline music makes the app scan other app folders that contain audio clips from messenger apps, why ?"
12089,AmazonMusic,brian jones,5,0,Really dig this app but disappointed I only have it for 6 more days when the free trial ends. Too many other sources for free music and not willing to spend $ for a subscription. Later Amazon music!ðŸ¤£
12090,AmazonMusic,Traj Anic,2,0,Was a great App to download to my phone but since Alexa and Prime it has been very difficult to get the app to download purchased music to my phone!!!! Not impressed Bezos give you can plough a few mill to get it right!
12091,AmazonMusic,Emma Welch,3,0,Not deployment friendly. Music only last for 30 days. we usually go longer without hitting any port and i will lose all my music. it sucks to pay for subscription fir something that doesn't work hiw i need it too.
12092,AmazonMusic,john Laurencelle,3,0,"Good interface. Stations tend to play the same songs over. Playlist like ""Top country"" don't update frequently enough. More and more songs become restricted to only Amazon unlimited, monthly fee is too high"
12093,AmazonMusic,Milton Mizenburg,5,0,"For the most part, this has an extensive collection of music. It's not perfect. I found some songs not obtainable and some artists not available. The app doesn't have any glitches to my knowledge."
12094,AmazonMusic,Spehmaster G.,2,0,"The genre classifications are nonsensical, ie Sydney Bechet is not Classical music. The stations do not play the songs they are meant to, eg the beatles station played one beatles song first then everything else but the beatles, ie Roy Orbison then Elvis. Kind of pointless saying it's a specific band then turns out to be a mix. Some albums have more than one track entry of the same name - every time the album is opened, another identical track is added. Obviously this is an problem."
12095,AmazonMusic,JaysSpace vlogs,4,0,"I've used the app for a year or so now, it's been working just fine, but all of the sudden some of the albums aren't on the catalog anymore. Can't listen to the show soundtrack for my production.."
12096,AmazonMusic,Joe Emerald,3,3,it's okay poor browse function. limited to what they want to showcase that week. can search though. disappointing for $10/ mo.
12097,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,"I absolutely love amazon music. It has all the best channels, and who can argue with having pretty much anything available simply by telling your device to play it."
12098,AmazonMusic,John Bulman,4,0,it has taken a bit of time to get used to after switching from another music streaming app but generally has a good range of music. playlists aren't to my taste yet but guessing that will change the more I use it.
12099,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,"My experience has been great. I only listen to what is available due to my prime account, which is a vast selection. This is better than my previous Pandora experience."
12100,AmazonMusic,Dessiree jagiello,4,0,"it has most of the music i want, but it's really sad i can't get led Zeppelin music, in less you want to pay, and yet there is no new music from them, or AC/DC"
12101,AmazonMusic,Hemanth Kumar,2,3,Not all music available and music search is not as good a s other music sites. This flaw doesn't encourage me to go ahead with music subscription.
12102,AmazonMusic,A Google user,1,3,"a hot mess. unreliable, must be force-closed to prevent indeffinite buffering, offline mode reacts to airplane mode only, but not to when i am actually offline, skipping tracks from notification works half the times. i dont like spotify, but their client is in a different league. same can be said about amazon smart tv app btw. netflix just kills it, without even breaking a sweat. you have great content and terrible clients that no one wants to use. let it sink in... stupid, huh?"
12103,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,3,Great Music app. I find songs and artists here I couldn't find elsewhere. I rarely ever have problems listening to music. You can tell they learned from other music apps and brought all the best features here. Only recommendation I have for them to add is video effects to play on screen while the music plays.
12104,AmazonMusic,Gary Flynn,5,0,"Love it, the whole family is much more hip now because of Amazon Music! People come up to me all the time and say "" Why are you so cool"" and I say Amazon Music!"
12105,AmazonMusic,Jesse Johnson,1,0,"I dont like how you search for a song and it's not easy to tell if it's a prime song or an unlimited song. If it's unlimited, and you listen to it, it automatically signs you up for unlimited without any warning.."
12106,AmazonMusic,William Mixon,4,0,don't have a continuous loop the album end's and the music stops. instead of starting a new album. Please let me know how to fix this. if possible. thanks you. Alexa
12107,AmazonMusic,Lee Carter,1,1,"absolutely sheet. hardly ever connects to your alrxa devices and shuts off often part way through a playlist. definitely a poor mans sonos, the reviews dont lie. dog sheet."
12108,AmazonMusic,Cat Whisperer,5,0,"I'm immensely enjoying this app!! It has a TON of old songs/albums that I so cherish--and even music that I greatly enjoyed while living overseas! Good job, Amazon Music!!"
12109,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,"brilliant app! Wide selection of music, it can be used with Alexa! Songs, albums and playlists can be saved for offline use at no extra charge! Well worth subscription cost."
12110,AmazonMusic,A Google user,3,0,"Not sure why like/dislike buttons show up only for Stations. No way to search for Stations, other than by category or alphabetically. Cover art sometimes doesn't match current song. Cover art is clipped."
12111,AmazonMusic,Jennifer Dyrbala,5,0,"I love Amazon Music. Lots of different playlists, by genre, mood, artist. New albums loaded o. release date. We pay extra so that the whole family can listen on different devices."
12112,AmazonMusic,Shambhavi Chauhan,4,15,The problem with hands-free alexa is that she misunderstood voices from the song and turn on herself. Its gets annoying when listening to songs with course words rythming with alexa.
12113,AmazonMusic,Mason Renning,2,0,"very few songs for what it is. also bought amazon music unlimited and still doesnt have a lot of songs i look for. i listen to alot of classic rock (zeppelin, motley crue, the doors....) should have mostly anything im looking for"
12114,AmazonMusic,Jacqueline Messenger,5,0,"Works excellent for me in the car, while in traffic and also came in very handy while on plane and I wasn't feeling all that talkative. I was able to ""rock out"" the whole way home!"
12115,AmazonMusic,Rachel Christensen,3,0,Freeze's up off and on. Today it has not worked at all. School and driving around doing errands was a drag today.. I even pay for the monthly student fee... rethinking that this past few months.
12116,AmazonMusic,Jan Madden,5,0,"Love the selection of music, options for playing on different devices, options for playlists and quality of sound. I enjoy this very much...great to listen while you work...and whistle too!"
12117,AmazonMusic,Kostadin Yordanov,5,0,it is a very good. I am using the free version as I am prime member and we do enjoy the music as and when we need. the library is extensive although not full. you need to pay extra for the rest
12118,AmazonMusic,Paula Allred,5,0,Amazing. I so appreciate being able to download for offline use. I travel a lot and cannot be online at times. I always have my beloved music with me at a reasonable price from Amazon music.
12119,AmazonMusic,Lon Parrish,5,0,"I found my kind of music, every time I felt like it. Thanks for your time in helping me enjoy my spare time. I'll keep on with your relaxing music. Good luck with the choices you give me in my life every day. God Bless!"
12120,AmazonMusic,Murray Cullon,5,0,"Great music selections and functionality. I play Amazon Music all the time. In my car, at home using my Smart TV, Alexa home group in 3 rooms, also in the backyard and garage on 2 Tronsmart stereo Bluetooth speakers...Love it!"
12121,AmazonMusic,Jen Souza,5,2,Love Amazon Music. I use it everyday on my way to and from work and sometimes at work. My favorite music app and the only one I use now.
12122,AmazonMusic,Omid Niavarani,2,3,Great selection of metal bands witht the paid subscription but the app ia now very slow even when connected to fast wifi. Makes it kinda useless. please fix soon.
12123,AmazonMusic,Jeff Weiss,2,0,"This app has some major flaws. 1 - you cannot exclude your christmas music or any other selected songs from shuffling when playing from your library. It is crazy that amazon left that feature out on this app. I am probably canceling my subscriptiin for this reason alone. 2 - Playback with streaming on my prime video account is blocked. Not acceptable since i pay seperately for both services. I am not sure how that their subscription service is considered ""unlimited"". 3 - Chromecast support."
12124,AmazonMusic,ashlie chan,3,0,"last time i downloaded it it kept telling me my chrome was outdated when i opened the app, even after i updated it. anyone else have this problem, or is it just me?"
12125,AmazonMusic,Donna Oleson,5,0,There is great variety of music available at any time. I like that the are stations based on music genre and performers. I also find the playlists to be interesting.
12126,AmazonMusic,Ron,4,0,i ypgraded to that pay service. I don't seem to get much more but if I go back it seems like I've lost music. I'm already a Prime member. Not sure why I'm paying more.
12127,AmazonMusic,J Aquiningoc,5,0,"This is the only app I use for my music listening, so many different Geru to choose from, my favorite is J Boog station and any other Hawaiian singers and groups Amazon Music has available, I'm a Hawaiian native Aloha"
12128,AmazonMusic,Shounak Sasane,4,0,"It drains a lot of battery, and sometimes takes a small pause in between downloaded song. Otherwise the application is great for listening music. You do need a prime account i guess."
12129,AmazonMusic,Anish B,2,0,Even though the idea is good bad user interface and experience. Playback gets stopped automatically after 2 or 3 songs and app gets closed. Amazon should better investigate the issue and resolve it.
12130,AmazonMusic,Greg Janiak,1,0,"music doesn't download half the time even though it shows completed, and even downloaded music still has to buffer several times a song. Glad it's a free trial because I would never pay for this service!"
12131,AmazonMusic,Thomas Richburg,5,0,"awesome service, can download very high quality music, I WAS a pdora customer service but was no were near as good as quality music. I have a system in my car and the quality differences in between the two services are night and day difference. Recommended for any one who loves quality sound and just flat out have to have the absolute best sound possible. spend your money hear. downloads are instant no waiting for ever (depends on your internet connection) but 17 song album in 30 seconds."
12132,AmazonMusic,v1kram S,4,0,Still a long way to go when compared to Spotify... Not a good library of playlist and a lot of cover songs from never heard artist and also still a long way to go for the collection. But brilliantly attached to the Prime membership to generate more stickiness
12133,AmazonMusic,mon deep,5,0,awesome app with great sound quality... the only problem I found is to switch between playlists . always previous playlists pop up in front of the screen... while I want to go to the new play lists...
12134,AmazonMusic,Ravi Kiran,5,0,"this is the only app we can cast to echo devices, and it doesn't lack much behind in regional song collection, the only thing is it doesn't do is, search properly, please improve the search functionality"
12135,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,"broad selection of music. this is great! have been using it for a year or 2..able to create music lists for different times like working our, waking, relaxing. i really like it"
12136,AmazonMusic,Helsing,5,0,"Very simple, good layout with a lot of options to tweek how you listen to your favourite songs. Very clear, great quality audio, too! Great app I recommend! I wish I found this sooner!"
12137,AmazonMusic,A Google user,3,1,"Nice app with good collection of my favorites. When I cast the playback to an Echo Dot, the option to control the playlist is gone. I really need the choice to change/modify the current playing playlist even when I use Echo Dot. This perfectly works when I cast it to my Google Home. Alexa integration is great and it works well most of the times in choosing the playlists."
12138,AmazonMusic,Mykal Anstrom,1,1,app used to be great but now every time I connect to WiFi it deletes every song I've downloaded. At this rate I'm about to end my unlimited subscription.
12139,AmazonMusic,nevin bennetch,2,0,Amazon: So we have millions of songs here but we hear you liked these five songs once so here you go! me: *dislikes the five songs* Amazon: here are five more songs by the same artists.
12140,AmazonMusic,Jack Kerwin,5,0,"I'm a huge fan. I work in remote locations at times so I fill up my phone with new music at home, and take it out where I can enjoy it without data usage or signal loss."
12141,AmazonMusic,james hernandes,3,0,love it would give it 5 stars but if you dont have prime music its a pain in the arss to work evertime i search for music it wont let me go directly to the music i have to do all this crazy stuff just to get to the music i want unlike before where you could just buy the song please fix that and then 5 ðŸŒŸ from me
12142,AmazonMusic,Tyler Harris,5,0,"I really enjoy Amazon Music. The interface is easy to use, it allows me to make custom playlists. There is a huge selection of music. I have to go way outside the mainstream until I find something they don't have."
12143,AmazonMusic,Tammy Aube,5,1,"Love Amazon music! no commercials, listen to what I like while working out! User friendly and easy to use!!"
12144,AmazonMusic,Abishek Sundar,3,0,"Removed songs should automatically be deleted from storage. I add new ones and remove old ones all the time, and all those old songs that were downloaded to my SD are hogging up gigabytes of space. Clearing cache doesn't work either. I have to uninstall the app and reinstall to clear the old songs from my storage."
12145,AmazonMusic,Cameron Hopkins,3,0,needs to have every option that Apple has. it doesnt allow you to tap the lyrics to get to that part of the song. add that feature now. im giving you 20 minutes.
12146,AmazonMusic,Shona Bailey,4,3,it takes a minute for the music to load and play sometimes. the music selection is great. sometimes I can't find some of the music I am looking for but overall it is a good app. I love the ability to build my own playlist. all round good app if you are into music and dont want to buy CDs any longer.
12147,AmazonMusic,Nikhil Hirani,3,0,"the app does not showcase songs by artist, only album and genre. it is kind of funny that such a basic feature is missing in the app. other than that the apl works well"
12148,AmazonMusic,A Google user,4,1,Great station. Would have given 5 stars were it not for an overabundance of remastered music. I listen to classic rock predominantly.
12149,AmazonMusic,Pankaj Naringrekar,4,6,"Good quality music, good database and/or collection of music. I'd not give the fifth star, the reason being that sometimes Alexa, the AI stuff, if you will, acts funny and dumb. She's gonna have to be more sophisticated or in other words there's more room for improvement on that front."
12150,AmazonMusic,Kevin Neal,3,0,Lots of songs But hard to sort and find Is not easy for me since I like a wide variety of music Can't pick your favorite artists or genres and just have it randomize from all of them - so no 'mixing' like in Pandora or Spotify
12151,AmazonMusic,Tim Harrington,5,0,It's wonderful to have unlimited access to a large variety of Music at your fingertips. I really enjoyed searching the recommendations to discover new music. A must-have for any adventurous listener
12152,AmazonMusic,Michael Stevens,5,0,"hate radio stations, repeat songs day after day, when you know there's a lot more out there. So got Amazon prime got 1000 songs and listening with no repeat for 4 days. loving it!!!"
12153,AmazonMusic,Greg Forehand,5,0,"Perfect App for any music lover....has old, new, and independent artists. Plus being able to download albums through your PRIME account makes it even better. Pretty much the only music app I use."
12154,AmazonMusic,Vicki Watts,2,0,"Dodgy at best is how I'd describe this app. Its extremely frustrating when you make a plaudits, only for a week later half the songs have been removed from the library and so not only is your players down to a couple of songs, but the app want play the remaining songs as it won't go past the missing song. Trying to use the app on the go is horrendous. It loses ""connection"" frequently and also tries to force you to play your songs online despite having songs downloaded."
12155,AmazonMusic,E V N Raja,1,7,"it is really annoying especially when traveling between one state to other state, when i use to play the collections taken offline, if the song being played for the first it starts buffering. i was in a mood to sleep peacefully by listening the cool, melody and lovely music. when it suddenly stops, then it is the biggest annoying also now a days am getting error #180 very frequently and my especially while traveling from 1 state to other. mostly network be in flight mode or in no-reachab state."
12156,AmazonMusic,Prakash Bhadri,4,0,Superb app. Nice selection of songs. Great Sound quality. 1 star less just because it doesn't work on weak connection. I live in a remote area connections are weak many times.
12157,AmazonMusic,MANU KAUSHIK,5,0,"The fact that this app comes bundled with Amazon Prime makes it extremely amazing. Has an amazing selection of the most indie artists out there. Keep up the good work, Bezos boi!"
12158,AmazonMusic,Taylor Carpenter,2,1,youd think paying 13 bucks a month youd get full access to the music like you do with Spotify for 10 dollars but you have to pay for prime plus their music plus. kinda greedy.
12159,AmazonMusic,Court R,5,1,can find almost any band or song I want within reason. Totally worth $9 a month. And unlike YouTube you can actually close your screen and the music still plays
12160,AmazonMusic,Becky Stephens,5,0,"my favorite platform for streaming music! i can choose from hundreds of artists and albums! it's wonderful!! not a big fan of paying for it, but you get what you pay for and that's why i love it. ðŸ˜Š"
12161,AmazonMusic,Ribhav Mishra,1,0,"It won't play the song I want it to, it'll play something else, when I tap on one song, it plays the previous song in the list. The music library is also smaller."
12162,AmazonMusic,Marcus Clemons,3,0,dont know if there was an update but it says in cant play half my online library because of a corrupt file...makes no sense because the songs are not on my device. it use to work perfect but now it has major lag and the app freezes while while playing songs by choice
12163,AmazonMusic,Griselda Lane,5,0,"I still give it 5 stars, though I have one thing I don't like. My husband & I can't listen to music at the same time without having to pay extra, even when we already pay to have Prime. Unless I'm missing something."
12164,AmazonMusic,Ray Calderon,3,0,"Pay pay pay pay$$$$$$$, It's all about money even though you already pay $119 yearly Prime subscription, they still want more if your money ..Really Jeff!"
12165,AmazonMusic,Stephen Lodewyks,5,0,"Great app, been using it for years. interface has gotten better and love the fact i can straam or download to my device. i subscribe to the Family plan and my wife and kids love it too."
12166,AmazonMusic,Kozmic Jonez,1,0,Not unlimited. Extra charges. Playback errors. Cancelled subscription twice. Decided not to renew. Not worth it. Just watch YouTube. They really do have everything. ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž
12167,AmazonMusic,Rich Wenner,5,4,"Crazy amount of music, even in the free version, and some of the unique stations are really useful. I use Top Dance for working out, and Meditation to help me get to sleep."
12168,AmazonMusic,barbara lewis,5,1,I've had amazon prime for yrs n never really took advantage of the prime perks. this is amazing. so much music. thank you amazon. no wonder ur stocks r so high
12169,AmazonMusic,Flavio Reyes,4,0,"Great selection of music find everything I have look for so far, only problem I see is that radios are not very consistent with the type of music they should be playing sometimes they play something from an entirely different genre."
12170,AmazonMusic,A Google user,4,0,"it's a great app, my only criticism is only one device can stream at a time without paying an additional fee. I feel a prime membership should allow me to stream from.2 devices at minimum."
12171,AmazonMusic,Heidi Altum,4,0,Love the app. Just kind of think there shouldn't be so much music that is not included in what I already pay for. But such is life. Everything always comes with the enticement to buy just a little bit more.
12172,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,"I listen to Amazon Music at work, in the car, at home relaxing & when I go to sleep at night. I love the commercial-free xapability as well as choosing music I enjoy MOST!!!"
12173,AmazonMusic,Catherine Wiberg,4,0,"I enjoy the Amazon Music app and use it daily. I would like to be able to alphabetize the songs in my playlist so I can find specific songs more quickly. Right now, that is not an option."
12174,AmazonMusic,Steven Funk,1,0,Do not use!! Their app has a serious memory leak issue which will complicate usage of your devices. The app has a serious crashing and memory problem. Use at your own risk!
12175,AmazonMusic,Eric H,4,0,i like the app i just don't like how you have to pay for unlimited on top on paying for prime it shoud come unlimited with prime and another thing that would make this app better is some visual effects to go with the music for the price it should that is the reason for the 4 stars if it had that it would be 5 stars
12176,AmazonMusic,Jana Wellman,3,0,Would like to see more of a variety of different categories without repeating the songs so frequently. This is a similar problem with Siriusxm's platform and it appears the only music streaming application that has it down is Pandora.
12177,AmazonMusic,Paul Frampton,3,1,stops working if you open the camera app on Android. it starts automatically when I get in the car but if I use the camera then it has to be manually restarted.
12178,AmazonMusic,Pranav Bhat,5,0,excellent collection of music. could always be better. id like to add and remove songs from my music or playlist more easily. search hits could be improved.
12179,AmazonMusic,Ethan Ott,3,1,I would rate it 5 star if all of the songs had lyrics available. I'd say half the songs have lyrics and I wish they all did so I can sing along.
12180,AmazonMusic,Max George,5,0,Great to have all kinds of music at your fingertips from old to current. Also to have continuous music all from my own personal choice and the memories that come with them. So big thumbs up Amazon Music ðŸ¤—ðŸ‘
12181,AmazonMusic,Anit Chakraborty,1,0,"This application constantly crashes and navigating through the downloads crashes the app. anything and everything crashes the app. unexpected from a big company like Amazon, worst music streaming application!"
12182,AmazonMusic,Douglas Shermer,4,0,"Works pretty well, has all the music I'm ever looking for. Only issue some song fail to play which causes the music to stop. Have to go back into app to skip the song.."
12183,AmazonMusic,Kerry McGill,5,0,"so far it has provided some amazing finds in music from various genres. seamless tobuse, add songs and create playlists. vast amount of choices and music finds. great app."
12184,AmazonMusic,Ms. Marvelous1286,3,0,"I hate that songs are ""not available"" anymore if you dont buy or download. makes me so irritated when I'm looking for a song I had and it's not there anymore."
12185,AmazonMusic,Lloyd Harris,4,0,I like the music but there were several songs that are longer free to prime members. Why? This songs are constantly being deleted from my playlists. Why?
12186,AmazonMusic,Gloria Spencer,5,0,"From all my favorite music for every mood and occasion, to guided meditations for healing and sleeping well, I rely on Amazon music to find what I need!!!"
12187,AmazonMusic,Jim Marshall,5,0,"I don't like being pushed to the subscriptions all the time. It's a good app but I won't pay for it. I figure I buy songs through the store to support it. But if I have to pay for the service... so long, bye bye."
12188,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,"Currently doing the 30 day free trial. Super easy to navigate through, love that you can find ANY songs or albums and make playlists. Will most likely be paying the $7.99/mo going forward."
12189,AmazonMusic,faraaz mfaraaz,4,0,add songs of the artist kayden. he is a famous artist. but when i search i see something else. just add his songs and you get a 5 star i assure you that. he is on spotify but if he comes on amazon that be great. please
12190,AmazonMusic,Ziggy Vertang,2,0,"Over complicated menus, sometimes getting to an artists page to buy a song that's not on prime proves difficult, they push the whole amazon music subscription far to much nearly every time I first open it I have to constantly say no to I don't want the 30 days free"
12191,AmazonMusic,Pamela Rockwell,4,0,Awesome app! It is easy to use and I enjoy the recommended play lists. Great perk for my prime membership. I would give it 5 stars if they didn't start the unlimited program.
12192,AmazonMusic,Brittney Poitra,4,0,it has everything but I hate when they say certain songs are unavailable but when I ask Alexa she can find what the search wont being up and then I have to re-add it to my music. rare. but happens.
12193,AmazonMusic,SkylarWontShutup,5,0,I like music and this plays it...so I like. In all seriousness I deeply appreciate the suggestion system. There is so much music I would never have known about were it not for Amazon.
12194,AmazonMusic,Brandi Prewitt,5,0,"I live my life to the tune of Amazon Music. Car, work, soccer, chores, shower.....Very rarely misses a beat or leaves me 'loading'. Much better than trying to stream youtube on the go."
12195,AmazonMusic,Rahul,3,0,The songs collection is poor. The app crashes very often. The only plus point is that there are no separate charges for downloading music (part of Amazon Prime Membership)
12196,AmazonMusic,David Crane,5,0,"my family has used Amazon music for about 5 years or so. about the same length of time on Prime. it has been great having access 2 all music, especially the Christian genre."
12197,AmazonMusic,Cyndy Spilberg,2,0,Hate the user interface. It is cluttered and unintuitive. Spotify interface is much cleaner and easier to navigate. Recommended listening is also more tailored to my taste.
12198,AmazonMusic,Carrie Price,5,0,I love love Amazon Music!! I can listen to any genre I want to either with my own playlist or one that is already made. There isn't a day that I don't listen to Amazon Music.
12199,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,"Enjoy the app and service, tho puzzled why a recording will be available one day and gone the next - example, Man from Ipanema, a compilation of Antonio Carlos Jobim's greatest recordings."
12200,AmazonMusic,Elizabeth Fleming,5,0,"Now THIS is a streamer!! I wanted to pick my songs because I hate the Eagles, man. That's all I wanted. Now I have finally graduated from 5 IPods. Thank you Amazon."
12201,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,The musical selection is enormous and new releases are added all the time. I love rhis app! It rarely locks up or has problems and I listen to music almost exclusively thru the app now in my car or anywhere. Purchases can easily be made thru the app. I no longer buy CDs and I love that I can listen to an entire album release and oick and choose which songs to download to my device for off line listening. The service fee for the unlimited music saves me money compared to what I used to spend.
12202,AmazonMusic,Shigeo Oshiro,5,0,"I've used amazon music for almost 3 years and it has brought rockin, jump up dancing at our beach and indoor volleyball games. Music makes you move! Plus it's so easy to use."
12203,AmazonMusic,Robert Lucia,5,0,"AS a music lover , Amazon Music is the best thing to happen  to me- I can listen to any song at at time on or offline!. Thank you Amazon for being so AWESOME"
12204,AmazonMusic,Jill French,5,0,"really enjoying listening to what I want. I love that if I turn it off on my playlist, it starts where I left off. great that I dont have to go in and deselect my playlist."
12205,AmazonMusic,anthony payne,5,0,"I love my Amazon music. I can make my playlist, listen to music. And I enjoy how I can back out of the app and still listen to music while using other apps."
12206,AmazonMusic,Alan Cole,5,0,"Uninterrupted pleasure! Have not had a drop yet like satellite. Love not having to listen to 10 minutes of garbage and 2 minutes of music like radio stations. Stream through my phone to the truck and let's go!! Making dinner, working out, and doing yard work there's an option for it all. Completely worth the Amazon prime membership."
12207,AmazonMusic,U Can Review,3,0,"A good selection of songs available, however the shuffle song feature is rubbish. It often play the same songs, when shuffled and the number of songs in the shuffle is limited."
12208,AmazonMusic,Erin Leach,3,2,"having to pay extra money to access the full library is a rip-off. I have a prime account, that should get me full access."
12209,AmazonMusic,Biswajeet Nayak,1,1,Search is very bad. I dont even get required song i want to find. Other music apps are good compared to this.
12210,AmazonMusic,Jeannie Light,4,2,"Pretty good app. I already pay for prime, so I don't want to pay even more for the 'music unlimited'. Some songs I'm not able to play because I need to pay more. That's an issue for me because I don't like companies that can't just make a sale and give all a product/ service."
12211,AmazonMusic,Veeraraghavan Iyer,5,0,"A very meticulously designed app. A must for all music lovers. I am enjoying the app for listening to Film songs, Rock music, Indian classical & Carnatic music.Thanks all' associated with the app."
12212,AmazonMusic,A Google user,1,0,the constant updates are really annoying music stops if i dont go online everyday when you pay bythe gig it uses allyour data with these continuous updates. have considered cancelling service just for that reason seems that my music is not availiable when i need it. even the music I own that is in the library isnt even avaiable that seems ridiculous to me i dont use the internet unless i need it because of the exessive cost of data nowadays
12213,AmazonMusic,Nick Watson,4,0,love the app... would love for the songs to be more random though. the first 20 songs are always the same.... wonder how much they get paid by those artists to keep those songs playing? hmmm
12214,AmazonMusic,Damian Carrillo,3,0,good song selection. enjoyed the lyric feature as well. the new music recommendation feature has a lot to be desired. I also wish that I could follow other users song list.
12215,AmazonMusic,Kate Self,4,0,"Although I really do love this app, I do find it frustrating when I search for something and because I refuse to pay for unlimited, I can't download it. Unlimited is pretty expensive!"
12216,AmazonMusic,Subhasis Das,4,0,Great app for music. Giving it 4stars due to occasional lags during streaming. Other area of improvement is in addition of songs to a playlist. There should be a better way than doing it song by song
12217,AmazonMusic,Cindy Wofford,2,0,"I really like the idea of the app. However, it often has playback errors and will stop playing, or play one song and stop, and need music restarted. Very annoying."
12218,AmazonMusic,Bob Christie,3,0,"It's fine, but the playlists are just American MOR versions of what you're expecting. And don't bother accessing it with Alexa, because half of your own music library won't be recognised or found."
12219,AmazonMusic,A Google user,4,0,"Pretty darn good. The only problem I have is when I go into ""see all"" music in an artist, the system does not remember which songs I already highlighted as part of my library."
12220,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,no thanks so much for all of your hard work in my room so I don't have any otherwise I'll be pics of the inside and outside of the box of stuff and I don't want to go back to school lol but it's just not a g d to get a hold on my account for me I don't have any plans for tonight but I'm sure we can find something time for me to come over and see you we can do it on the way back to the house and get a few more minutes to talk about the house for a few minutes before handing ove evehousr a bit
12221,AmazonMusic,Jeffery Blumenshein,2,0,the amazon unlimited ads that hijack your screen are out of control. having the ad pop up as I'm switching songs so it clicks the ad instead of the next button is a little dirty. you are better than this.
12222,AmazonMusic,Mo Kamali,3,0,"overall good experience. im just frustrated by how difficult it is to download your music for offline playing. If i add somthing to my library, i want it to automatically download..."
12223,AmazonMusic,Andrew Marke,4,5,I like that you dont have to pay for play when you want and offline downloads if you have prime but dislike that theres is quite a bit of music locked behind a paywall. But overall a good app
12224,AmazonMusic,Paul Allan,4,0,"it's pretty good to be fair, that said there are some tracks and artists that are unavailable that are available on spotify. So come 9n Amazin sort it out and get 5 stars."
12225,AmazonMusic,Sharon & Mike Monk,5,2,I use it all the time. Love being able to listen to any musical piece I want. Super selections. User friendly!
12226,AmazonMusic,Tristan Fisher,3,0,"application locks up often and has some surprising behaviors (strange ux; e.g. search being limited to the current panel, back sometimes going to the playlist -- exiting other times). download quality not particularly high bitrate"
12227,AmazonMusic,Tyler Starke,4,0,"it's alright. i still want a better music service overall, the Alexa integration is nice but needs improvement. overall it's a great app since my music is through Amazon."
12228,AmazonMusic,Ryan Sargent,1,6,"Great app! Unless you: 1. don't mind it deleting music you'd bought from Amazon off your phone AFTER you switch to Unlimited or 2. don't mind it cutting out if your connection is thir absolute least bit spotty. Which wouldn't be a problem IF Amazon hadn't deleted 3/4's of the music YOU'D BOUGHT YEARS AGO from your phone's internal memory. So you're stuck waiting for the app to buffer. If you're constantly tethered to wifi, works great."
12229,AmazonMusic,Tom Thompson,5,0,this is an easy to use app that allows you to search music and save customized stations. I really like the ability to save multiple playlists for online use and the ability to save music for offline play as well.
12230,AmazonMusic,Justin Pierce,4,0,"Seen an equalizer in the settings yesterday. was there this morning but at around 6:55 i got back on and went to change thr settings, and it wasnt there anymore."
12231,AmazonMusic,Iamabbu An,3,0,"good app. but ths needs alot of makover. stations are standard. app is not smart enough to capture the genere based on the songs I play. competetor app give lot many better features. As a hard care Amazon fan, I want to see best from Amazon..."
12232,AmazonMusic,Sunshine Green,3,0,"love it, except they took away option to have a DOWNLOADS DROPDOWN under ""my Music"". why can't you guys hold our musis in ""offline"" or wherever it was like you used to? that's a HUGE DOWN SIDE?!!!"
12233,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,7,"All things music available at your finger tips! You have access to radio stations by genres or playlists by whatever it is you are needing music for like parties, workout, cooking etc. What i love most of all is how you can create your own playlists! I use Amazon music daily!"
12234,AmazonMusic,Giuseppe Nuzzi,2,1,"Was 5 star. But now changed to 2. Upon playing the next track, it will not load or buff the next song. Making me waste my time ðŸ˜”"
12235,AmazonMusic,Bryan Pecoraro,4,2,"There is definitely a learning curve to using this app especially if you are trying to make a playlist. It is not inherently user friendly. For example, if I want to add to a playlist, and accidentally add to ""my music"" it does not allow you to add to another playlist. If it does, it's not easy to do. Good integration with Alexa though!"
12236,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,"very good collection of music, esp old Hindi songs. The clarity of these old songs also have been improved upon, enhancing the listening pleasure. only couple of requests from my side: 1) add a timer option in the settings so that the app automatically shuts off; this is useful while listening at night, when one tends to doze off 2) allow for sorting ( alphabetical ) of songs within a personal playlist"
12237,AmazonMusic,Christopher Dougherty,2,0,"No way I can import a Playlist? Seriously? The best customer service could give me is to manually input 2000 songs, individually, by hand. Bring that feature back it's a deal breaker"
12238,AmazonMusic,Julian Cwalinski,4,0,"Good app, but the options button next to the songs is too fiddly, as I often end up playing a song when I wanted to add it to a playlist. Good boy Amazon, well done!"
12239,AmazonMusic,Laurie Wilson,5,0,"Love having the music I want to listen to on multiple devices. No adds no BS, they even recommend music, and I have found most of it I really like! Highly recommend!"
12240,AmazonMusic,Ariam Allen,5,0,"It is rare that I am unable to find an album or an artist that I am looking for. Also, the playlists generated by Amazon & other users has introduced me to more music that I love."
12241,AmazonMusic,Jessica Franco,4,0,"I love that the music app is part of the Prime Membership, but many of my favorite songs were available and then eventually removed from the library. Why limit the selection?"
12242,AmazonMusic,Dexerra Arrexed,2,0,"Used to work until today, now the app starts a constant loop asking me to update chrome despite it being the updated version. App literally won't let me sign in despite me paying for the service, disgraceful."
12243,AmazonMusic,Tom Gombold,5,0,"Love this app. Great stations, access to tons of music and runs for hours without killing my battery. Used other music apps, but this is the best one I've found yet."
12244,AmazonMusic,Jonathan Searer,5,0,"I absolutely hate commercials, but love semi-free music. this app is great for that, and their classic rock radio is by far the best of all the music streaming services."
12245,AmazonMusic,Nishant Kumar,2,0,you really need to improve song search and your songs inventory. most of the good songs are not present. Disappointed with this kind of paid service. google music is far better.
12246,AmazonMusic,Big Battle,1,6,"what. lousy development, this app and echo app, have lousy development, developer 101. they don't really work together you really can't have one without the other two fully maximized the echo but I don't know it seems pretty easy to be able to integrate one app the Echo app on Amazon music has nothing to do with your Echo it only plays on phone meaning why would you put it on the app"
12247,AmazonMusic,Elisha Cody,3,1,the music choice is endless although i still wonder why there is so many Christian music options every time i look for new music???
12248,AmazonMusic,Jon Rosling,5,2,"Great app - my one stop for digital music of any kind now, so much so that I rarely, if ever, by physical media."
12249,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,2,Love the convenience and how it picks songs for you based on your taste and style. Makes pretty good recommendations too when new music comes out.
12250,AmazonMusic,Jeff Dolbee,4,0,Fairly good. Too many quirks and sw design to list. Biggest being the app pucks up VMs and shows on recently added. mind boggling and i am no novice but no forum faq or other reference solves. STUPID. but overall works fine.
12251,AmazonMusic,Scott Alderson,4,0,easy to use. wish it would pick up where i left off instead of starting at the beginning. i know i can pause but sometimes pausing is not realistic or possible.
12252,AmazonMusic,Karyn Burt,5,0,"Great variety and way to keep up with what's up and coming today. The unlimited gives soo much to choose from, it's ridiculous!! I love this app!"
12253,AmazonMusic,Jessica Everett,4,0,There have been a few times that I couldn't find music I was looking for. Sometimes music that I have on my playlist gets removed. Probably due to licensing issues or something like that but still I can't give it a perfect rating because of that
12254,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,put it this way I never watch TV anymore love the app love the features love the fact that it's not a video so you get hammered with data it's very very close to perfect for my taste in music apps. good job Prime member is the way to go baby!
12255,AmazonMusic,Akshay Rathnavas,3,0,"I don't know if this review will make a difference, but here are my thoughts. 1. A real-time lyrics with the songs would be nice. 2. The collection could be better. But other than this, the app works really good."
12256,AmazonMusic,A Google user,1,0,NAG NAG NAG! I only want Prime music but every time I want to use this I have to tell them AGAIN that I don't want to sign up to the full subscription music service. Dismal!
12257,AmazonMusic,billysielu,3,1,"app is good but nags me to subscribe to amazon music every couple of days, v.annoying. nagged me to give a 5 star rating today so here's my honest 3 star rating."
12258,AmazonMusic,A Google user,4,2,"The one thing that I like about Amazon Music is how they separate your music choices from Albums to Artist to Songs all the way to Genre which is my favorite. I can just go to genre, pick Heavymetal/Rock, choose shuffle & I got hours of headbanging & a neck brace to look forward to!!! Hell Yeah!"
12259,AmazonMusic,Patrice Strothers,5,0,Amazon music works great for me! I'm on the road quite a bit and it provides so much convenience! I don't have to look for music because everything that I love is there and they give me access to so much more.
12260,AmazonMusic,Karen Schagel,2,0,"Sucks to lose all your music you downloaded after you had unlimited (given free by the way)and now just normal with prime membership, and back to hardly any songs. Time to go back to Pandora."
12261,AmazonMusic,Matthew Fedroff,5,0,love Amazon period and if u where unaware if you are public assistance food stamps or cash benefits and even if you are on Medicaid with none of the oty assistance programs you can get Amazon Prime for a monthly rate of $5.99 cant beat it besides the money you save on shipping add in prime video and Amazon Music which as an avid music listener who has trialed both payment options for Spotify as well as Pandora Amazon Music is better by far a No Brainer choice.
12262,AmazonMusic,Top Dogg,5,0,"The music options are great. The only thing that irks me is the constant offer of Amazon music unlimited when i have declined it multiple times past. Offer me a ""remember my choice"" box."
12263,AmazonMusic,Devin Felix,4,1,"The only problems I would say that I have with the app, are when the songs are suddenly removed from the catalogue and I am unable to listen to them. I wish that would happen less. The other problem would be that I wish the playlists were not limited to 500 songs. At least bump it to 1000."
12264,AmazonMusic,Freddie Collins,5,0,enjoy the music that is available in the store to puchase and download. Only a few songs that are not available to purchase. Easy to import songs into my main music library.
12265,AmazonMusic,A Google user,4,1,"pretty decent overall, has virtually every song you would want. seems to have trouble keeping particular songs and soundtracks tho."
12266,AmazonMusic,Timothy Shaw,5,3,"Absolutely love it. Could have better options on the music you can listen too, and the samples. I use it daily. Actually using it right now. I alway recommend this to people. Even if they dont ask. lol. must have app. along with Prime! I call it Optimal Prime!!"
12267,AmazonMusic,Micah Liess,3,0,Great app that has all the music you could ask for. The only issue I'm having is even though I have the updated app the music will stop playing whenever I have full service and I'm not sure what is causing it.
12268,AmazonMusic,Pam Hilton,5,0,"easy to use, great selections. I like the ""recommended for you"" feature ... I've heard music I'd forgotten about, as well as some I've never heard of."
12269,AmazonMusic,Melanie Ann,5,0,"This is the best music app I have ever had the pleasure of using. I highly recommend this app to everyone. Enjoy the wide variety of endless, ad free mysic."
12270,AmazonMusic,William Schaefer,5,7,"Excellent music service, especially when you consider it is part of prime. i use this to stream all of my music since Microsoft shut down Groove music. i don't expect Amazon to stop backing the application mid stream like MS has. the fact that you are able to stream to many devices simultaneously is awesome."
12271,AmazonMusic,Richard Zaynor,4,0,"Very good app, but not perfect. The songs on the albums you purchase don't play in order, and the app frequently bugs me to upgrade. Overall, I do recommend it."
12272,AmazonMusic,Lalit R.,5,0,This is the best music app that I have ever used. It includes all the latest songs & playlists. Music stations in Amazon Music are amazing. Alexa works very well too.
12273,AmazonMusic,Tracey Martinez,5,1,I still use it everyday at work. I can mix things up by my mood. Helps make my occasionally boring job go by more quickly.
12274,AmazonMusic,Butch Adams,5,0,"Everything from Amazon Unlimited, Alexa, the Echo, and this app converge into a fantastic experience. This app is the best of all the streaming services and I have uninstalled everything else."
12275,AmazonMusic,Emmanuel Embuscado,1,0,"I like the fact you can queue songs, but those 3 tiny dots you have to hit just right makes it difficult to queue songs. I still have issues connecting to Chromecast on occasion."
12276,AmazonMusic,Richard Ragsdale,3,0,"Great music experience with large selections of artist and music genres, just wish Amazon music could read the music already on my devices and play it. Music I already had I have to save again in Amazon or use another player."
12277,AmazonMusic,Doug Provost,5,0,Amazon music is wonderful! I love the interface as well as music suggestions. It's seamless integration with Alexa is extremely helpful and useful. Thank you Amazon!
12278,AmazonMusic,Erin McKenzie,4,0,This is a true cost vs personal value comparison. Cons: There aren't many aside from the overall sticker price costs. 1) extensive artist collections 2) listen to the actual songs you want in any order as many times as you want 3) no skipping penalties Other Cons: it's perhaps more costly than putting up with ads while not being able to directly pick the songs you want to hear
12279,AmazonMusic,Darryl Wills,4,1,"the app is wonderfull for finding new music in multiple disciplines. My main gripe, there is not an equalizer with in the app to sound shape different styles of music. it would be nice to be able to setup multiple profiles with an equalizer for different types of music. other then that the app is great for my basic music needs."
12280,AmazonMusic,Dave Wilhite,5,0,"The feature you get with Amazon Prime make it WAY better than Pandora. thousands of songs, customized suggestions and playlists, even offline and best yet, NO ADS! It's all I listen to now."
12281,AmazonMusic,J. S.,4,1,"It's awesome so far with a few small exceptions; there are two albums by Great White that are not available on this app. I can only find those albums on YouTube. Other than that and a few other unavailable songs, the app is terrific and I plan on continuing the subscription ."
12282,AmazonMusic,Barbara Flaherty,5,0,Love this can find anything I want to listen to. love the fact that there are so many songs and artists to choose from. Also love the fact that I can play it through my Alexa or my car. ðŸ˜Š
12283,AmazonMusic,Vickie Givens,5,0,I thoroughly enjoy listening to Amazon Music with my Bose noise-canceling headphones! Wishing I had done this long ago. I have everything from Keith Whitley to Bruno Mars.
12284,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,first time i have ever tried out prime music and i love it. i can save my favorite songs and play them later. also i can sample other artists' songs and order the audio cd later.
12285,AmazonMusic,Nicki Morales,5,0,"Pandora used to be my go to, but I had issues accessing it when traveling internationally. Amazon music sold this problem and I enjoy it more since I can use it with my data program and on wifi."
12286,AmazonMusic,A Google user,3,0,"Amazon music doesn't have all the songs of artist like prateek kuhad , the local train and a lot of punjabi artist which is a shame...Apple music provides more songs and takes a lead...If Amazon music updates its library...then it would be great"
12287,AmazonMusic,Don Winslow,5,0,"fantastic!! all the music you could ever want from classics to new releases, nursery rhymes to heavy metal, show tunes, film scores, pop & soul & country its all here."
12288,AmazonMusic,Genevieve Harkness,5,0,This is my favorite spp my girl friend told me about it last week and I've been on it every day since then I'ma an old timer and i can get music from the yesr 1 if i wanted too right now im hung up on Hsrry Belafonte for any of you seniors out there if you like calyiso get on it I've been dancing sll over the house.
12289,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,"An excellent collection of music, to suit all moods. My go to app when I want to hear something new. It has easily met my expectations. And it is priced very reasonably too."
12290,AmazonMusic,A Google user,2,0,It's a cool app. I'm just not impressed by the the stations. They are great the first time you listen to them but then you notice they play the same songs over and over maybe sometimes in a different order. I pay for prime and unlimited so where is the selection of songs. These artists have more then just the same 2 you keep playing.
12291,AmazonMusic,Johnathan W.,3,0,"Great music app with a growing selection of the Japanese music I love. Though, it can enter very long loads at times and the recommendations for new songs needs heavy work which hurts discovering new music."
12292,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,Great choice of channels and amazing recommendations for new artists. Perfect streaming and works independently in the background while I use my phone. No adverts. Generally top class.
12293,AmazonMusic,Scott Stroik,2,1,"All was fine with this app until the other day. I opened up the app to play my music and my playlists were gone as well as most of the music I had in "" my music"" including most of the songs I paid for. Not sure what happened, still investigating."
12294,AmazonMusic,Jennifer moncallo,1,0,Application stops working suddenly. Skips songs and runs non stop in the background. we're paying almost $7 for poor service. definitely considering cancelling the subscription going back to Pandora....
12295,AmazonMusic,Rochelle LaMance,5,0,so much better than pandora or spotify as far as sound quality. disappointing that a lot of the good songs you actually have to buy unlike Pandora or Spotify where they are free but you have to deal with the ads.
12296,AmazonMusic,Joshua Sanchez,5,0,It is no wonder Amazon is the leader in the market. As a Prime member I get access to millions of songs with out ads? Watchout Spotify and Pandora.
12297,AmazonMusic,Heather Hornung,5,0,"I use Amazon Music almost every day. I love the variety of music. i enjoy being able to select a particular album, artist, genre, or even a mixture of different artists based on a particular song, artist, or genre. Ive tried Pandora, iHeart, and Spotify, and I think Amazon is by far the best out of all."
12298,AmazonMusic,Eric Guth,2,0,"It's ok but the constant ads for unlimited are very annoying and it's not as easy to use as Spotify. edit: removing another star for constant, shameless, self-promoting ads."
12299,AmazonMusic,Luka Hamm,4,0,Quite enjoy using this app. Almost always has the songs I'm looking for. Only wish they could make it easier to mix my music and downloaded music onto the same playlist.
12300,AmazonMusic,Gabriel Sarracino,2,0,"this app is pretty bad, I can download songs but if I turn data off it won't work. even with data turned on it still skips. I've reinstalled the app several times and it still skips."
12301,AmazonMusic,Camp Amnesia,3,0,Would prefer to have music available sooner on prime. I have been waiting for a particular song to be available. Wings of an Angel Lauren Alaina. Thank you for your time.
12302,AmazonMusic,Chiranjeeb Ghosh,4,0,"great interface. there are some glitches still which are serious hindrances to smooth experience, for e.g. adding new songs leads to deletion of previously added songs, which is weird. great collection of songs."
12303,AmazonMusic,Brandon Gonzalez,4,0,"one thing i dont like is that they delete certain albums and upload the newer version or deluxe edition. if youre going to do that at least give me a notification saying youre doing that or better yet, just swap it out in my library. hate when i want to listen to a song and when i finally get to it i noticed its no long available and now i have to go looking for the updated album/version and add it back to my list. but other then that i have no problems."
12304,AmazonMusic,TheBlessedone37,2,2,what I'm complaining about see as a constant with this app in that it keeps crashing regardless of what make or model phone. I like the music selection but your player for the music obviously sucks. going back to using the pre - installed music player for my phone lol
12305,AmazonMusic,Ben Relac,2,0,"The app has trouble playing music without an internet connection, even if the song is ""downloaded"". I can't walk around campus without the music pausing to load."
12306,AmazonMusic,Tim Landstrom,2,0,A little disappointing. I had reason to believe this app was free if you are an Amazon Prime member but I'm getting charged every month for it might go back to Google Music because it's much better with more deep cuts.
12307,AmazonMusic,Graham Church,4,0,very friendly to use app. vast amount of music available. only issue is that some songs/albums won't play via Bluetooth.. this is the only thing that holds it back.
12308,AmazonMusic,John Langenfeld,4,0,"pretty satisfying, 1 problem most of my downloaded music duplicates and some triplicate the original file....I have to delete 2-3 additional files of the same song. thankful for expandable memory :) not a deal breaker for me."
12309,AmazonMusic,Timothy Reinerman,5,0,"I gave up on other streaming services when I found out, for the most part, I can listen to full albums on Amazon. It has a CRAZY amount of available and for the price, it can't be beat."
12310,AmazonMusic,Gene Horton,5,0,"pros= playlists, plays on alexa, number of songs, don't have to have screen on while listening. cons= not free.... prime membership required, even pay above membership for full access. I use it all the time ane love it."
12311,AmazonMusic,Clarissa Bethmore,5,0,I am in LOVE with this app!! It's awesome!! I love the song collection so so so much!! I recommend this to everyone. But one has to have a amazon prime membership.
12312,AmazonMusic,Elisa WVMama'sDogsCatsBunRatties,5,0,"Love Amazon Music. We have the family plan so each of us have our own music for only $14.99 a month. So far every bit of music we have looked for, they have!!!"
12313,AmazonMusic,Kristin Taylor,1,0,"I actually use to like this app. The app was perfectly fine until it got rid of all the songs in 3 of my playlists for no reason. From now on, I will be using Pandora."
12314,AmazonMusic,Julie Clark,3,0,"They bother you a bit to much about rating and upgrading, and it would be nice if the playlists allowed for reorganizing. Qualityis decent, and works as a storage app."
12315,AmazonMusic,R M,4,0,I will rate it a 5 when you can save play list. I lost all my best play list when I changed to a new phone. there isnt a way to save offline playlist.
12316,AmazonMusic,Amber Bates,5,0,"Wide variety, interesting channels, you can skip as many songs as you want, pick one artist or play that artists channel with similar music it's up to you."
12317,AmazonMusic,Duane Carter,3,0,Difficult to use because it requires too many inputs to start play selection. it's not a mobile friendly car audio source. pandora just plays after one to two selections.
12318,AmazonMusic,Damian McAndrew,4,0,this has to be my favourite app for music my only reason for the 4 stars is that while it will automatically sync music i buy with my devices i have to manually update playlists that i create. if amazon sorted this issue it would be 5 stars all day long.
12319,AmazonMusic,andres s,5,0,"so far so good. great price for a great variety. I switched from Napster which malfunctioned here and there, selection wasnt that great at times."
12320,AmazonMusic,Debra Castrinos,2,0,I tried to log out but couldn't find a place so I had to uninstall it in order to stop it from playing or showing up on my screen. That was in 2015. it is now 2019 so I tried it again with the same problem.
12321,AmazonMusic,K Kleypas,5,0,"Rarely an interuption , except in tiny town twice in 2 months, but still better than Verizon's telephone connection. Great selections, can skip songs, and play themes."
12322,AmazonMusic,Joseph Brehm,4,0,very good. one thing i don't care for is the service will just delete an album you have in your library. no longer available. it's happened 3 to 4 times.
12323,AmazonMusic,K Shark,5,0,"Great to use with the echo. On mobile i like the X-ray lyrics so I can memorize and sing along... you know, for when my music career takes off... ðŸ˜"
12324,AmazonMusic,Erin Brant,3,0,"The app always crashes on me. The search is a pain to use, too. I'd appreciate a suggestion, much like Google, if I mispell something."
12325,AmazonMusic,betti ingman,4,0,Mostly good. the options on the phone app arent as robust as on my laptop....but if I know what I am looking for I can find it. the selection in Amazon music is outstanding.
12326,AmazonMusic,A Google user,3,0,good app but ads pop up fullscreen on launch which is very frustrating. when im at a stoplight trying to turn on a song i dont have time to click carefully past ads. i buy hundreds of dollars of music from amazon so please dont advertise to me!
12327,AmazonMusic,Pamela,4,0,"Doesn't give me EVERY song I search for and doesn't have great recommendations for my current music mood. All in all, it's an easy app and great way to listen to music."
12328,AmazonMusic,Kristie Rich,5,0,"Love, Love this app. I can listen to any artist I want. I have yet to have trouble finding an old artist or new. I use the playlists all the time to workout as well as the stations. Like I said, I Love this app!"
12329,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,"easy to use, and i like that i can cast a song or playlist to one echo Dot and then easily switch to a different dot or to Everywhere from this program, which is hard to do with just Alexa."
12330,AmazonMusic,Kem Hall,4,0,I love Amazon but i do not like how they are forcing you to sign up for a subscription by not having new songs available to buy as a single and sometimes not even as an album. There are too many other venues to try to play those games.
12331,AmazonMusic,Liliana Real,5,0,"So far I have had this app for a year and I've switched back and forth with Tidal, Spotify, Sound Cloud and this is the most reliable. I like Sound Cloud but Amazon connects to my Alexa devices."
12332,AmazonMusic,A Google user,3,0,"Songs in my play list all of a sudden are no longer available. Other music services do this also, I hoped that Prime would be different. Just an other music service."
12333,AmazonMusic,A Google user,3,0,"Need more languages. Also, it keep stopping inbetween when playing through BT. Any notification interrupt the streaming. Must have an option in setting with regard to notification interrupting the music playback."
12334,AmazonMusic,Christopher Hulsey,2,0,I can not get it to play via the home screen widget or from Android auto. I either have to open Amazon music or in Android Auto select a playlist. it refuses to just play the last playlist I previously selected.
12335,AmazonMusic,Darren Tree,5,0,"Great as part of Prime membership ecosystem. For Â£8/mnth I was happy to pay for the prime deliveries around xmas time, but have found the value of prime deliveries+video+music to be great value through the year."
12336,AmazonMusic,John Via,2,0,wish you could sort playlists alphabetically. Prime songs don't stay prime. constantly trying to upsell me to the unlimited plan. how many times do I have to say no?
12337,AmazonMusic,Jeff Carrington,3,0,"Good music app, only problem I've had with it is when you make a playlist and they keep taking down the songs, a lot, had to drop my unlimited membership and try another app,"
12338,AmazonMusic,jitark darji,4,0,"for music quality its the 5 stat app, if is has a good engine like Spotify and youtube music that learns your music taste and recommend same songs then its the best app. quality wise its competition to both the apps. improve interface and add like button for songs"
12339,AmazonMusic,Brian Rivera,2,0,not recommended for non-american ppl. u wont find most of ur fav hometown music on it. but if u only want english american songs sure go ahead. of course 70% of the songs are behind premium status. so prepare ur wallet
12340,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,I have been using this app for about rwo years. i have set up several play lists I use for workouts. I find this app easy to use and very reliable.
12341,AmazonMusic,markdbrown007,5,0,"Music I have not heard in decades right at my fingertips, without buying a CD or download, no commercials, included with our annual Amazon Prime subscription! Winner..."
12342,AmazonMusic,Pablo Zuniga,1,0,"Not sure whats going on, but my Amazon Music app keeps closing on me. And im having this issue with only this app. this has been going on for 3 weeks now"
12343,AmazonMusic,Kerrilee Campbell,4,0,"Great app, only gripe is that 'clean' edits aren't the default, so I have to remember to specifically ask for clean edits of songs when listening with the kids!"
12344,AmazonMusic,Joe Carrillo,5,0,"three months free got me. I love being able to yell Alexa play this or alexa play that from across the shop I work in, makes life a bit better & that's worth its weight in gold!"
12345,AmazonMusic,Tony Elwood,5,0,"Digging me some Amazon services... Say what you will about big tech and big box stores killing the little guy, but the convenience and cost make it pretty irresistible."
12346,AmazonMusic,Trevor Paterson,5,0,I can honestly say that I am very happy with this app. Amazon music app is one hundred percent great. very clear sound and I can get all the music that I want.
12347,AmazonMusic,Jacob Johnson,5,0,"always great, able to listen to what I want, without all the annoying commercials. change the station when i want without running out of skips"
12348,AmazonMusic,Jauger Trinidad,5,0,This app is great! I love that you can pick whatever genre pleases you and it's quite affordable. It works in most places whether you are home or on the road! Great service!
12349,AmazonMusic,m barraje,4,0,"It would be great if you allowed customers to add other ""station"" playlist to the one your listening to. For example combine Lady Gaga station with LL Cool J station if you want to."
12350,AmazonMusic,KK VARMA,4,0,"Good collection of songs (including non English) let's you download songs which is great if no WiFi or data. Note Amazon keep moving songs from prime to unlimited service, which is subscription based."
12351,AmazonMusic,John Warman,5,13,I've used the other large music apps but really like Amazon the best!! Very user friendly app and all the music selection in the world.
12352,AmazonMusic,Tren T,1,0,"I gave you a 1 only bc everytime I delete songs from my offline music collection, they reappear downloaded all over again. This has happened like 5 times. I get tired of skipping these old songs I deleted days ago! ðŸ¤¨ðŸ¤¨"
12353,AmazonMusic,carol lee,5,0,"Amazing array of genres, artists and songs. No longer need to buy, download, or subscribe to Sirius, etc. Love the flexibility, convenience and variety."
12354,AmazonMusic,Raghunadha Chakravarthi,1,0,"please improve the interface of the APP,its not convincing to use for a prolong period of time and making to switch to the other competitors,not to mention the names."
12355,AmazonMusic,KENDRICK CHARITY,1,0,Stupid and unusable. It says it will send a security code so when i go get the code and try to come back it keeps asking me to sign in again and the code that you just sent does not work and it wants to send me a new code again
12356,AmazonMusic,Fred Goodrum,4,0,"the function performs as expected. The User interface is a little awkward. For example, if I want an afternoon of albums,it is difficult to navigate and control efficiently."
12357,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,Got free use due to having prime account cannot fault it. Also If you take the time to rate the songs you like the suggestions you are given are brilliant and may even find artists you have never heard of but enjoy listening to.
12358,AmazonMusic,Katrina Prado,5,0,"i really love this app...i have all my playlists always at my fingertips, plus it is quite easy to find something new when i want to look for something i don't have!"
12359,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,"I love amazon music, especially since they fixed the music pausing while driving around, i drive alot, and was very frustrating to have the music cut out. i have no more issues, great app!"
12360,AmazonMusic,Anthony Green,4,0,prime should be all I need to listen to all artists and stations. Amazon unlimited should be included imo. outside of this the app is wonderful as my primary means of playing music online.
12361,AmazonMusic,Aditya Verma,2,0,I personally don't find Amazon Music's UI very user friendly. Recently Spotify started catering their services in India and before this I hadn't use Spotify but I'm loving my experience on Spotify as they have an easy UI and plus their daily curated playlists is it's biggest advantage and puts Prime music to shame.
12362,AmazonMusic,murali Mohan,5,0,A good music app and alexa helps me to search songs through voice command instead of typing and it almost gives accurate results in many cases. Found this app to be better than spotify which I used for a month and switched to Amazon music.
12363,AmazonMusic,Kristi Grice,4,0,"my one issue is the ""stations."" They're not a random shuffle of songs you like it's just a playlist of the same 20+ songs over and over again."
12364,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,1,Too Layed Back to Track. Loving everything. It's like having surround sound on the goðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„three smiles and ah I'm going to tell everybody.
12365,AmazonMusic,Rosie Summers,3,0,"Used to love this app, but like everything else, it giveth and then taketh away. Prime Members should not have to pay for the ""unlimited"" version."
12366,AmazonMusic,Brian Acebo,4,1,"I have enjoyed checking out a lot of music for free, and making mixed playlists that I can download. Because it is not the unlimited version, however, there are like it's to what is available. Also, the set of available music changes."
12367,AmazonMusic,Michelle DeZwaan,5,0,"Love it! Easy to find any genre, artist, album or song. Even snippets of songs usually brings up what I am looking for. I am completely satisfied with this app."
12368,AmazonMusic,Sandi Labour,3,1,"i try to listen to this app at work, it will play for about 20 min or less and the app closes or it has some kind of failure to it."
12369,AmazonMusic,Larry L,3,0,"Great wheb Amazon isn't messing around, drips and forgets your playlists and downloaded music. Investing time setting it up is a total waste of time because it randomly gets deleted."
12370,AmazonMusic,Enjae Ostberg,3,0,"it's great because i have an echo but a lot of the songs i have purchased are ""no longer available"" until that changes, my rating will remain."
12371,AmazonMusic,Allicia C,5,0,"I love using this app. especially since I spend so much time in my car, the hands free voice options are fantastic. better than Pan...never mind."
12372,AmazonMusic,DEVANG PATEL,1,1,in last played playing list select to play after it automatically play previous song ....i think it should be required many changes ....like fire stick.....
12373,AmazonMusic,David Mosher,3,1,"Sluggish, counterintuitive interface, constantly disappearing tracks and albums. Good library but the app sorely needs a complete overhaul."
12374,AmazonMusic,Vallala Vamshikrishna,1,1,"no proper search results, especially not giving telugu songs. when you search some Telugu it's giving some results for some other results."
12375,AmazonMusic,matt gutierrez,3,1,"on multiple occasions Ive had songs become ""no longer available"" have to delete them from my list and go back to the album to find again. Aslo this app doesnt always have album that I want to listen too there alot of other glitches that Ive encountered as well that cause someone to become completely frustrated and not want to use the app."
12376,AmazonMusic,Vadiraj K,1,0,i buyed prime for music app purpose but the thing is algorithm is working fine but sumtime songs are not adding to playlist some time suddenly stops and playlist automatically deleted. solve these problems. i am editing this agin that is app is completely shi*
12377,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,"I rarely listen to the radio anymore because Amazon Music has almost everything I have ever looked for. Plus, the recommendations help me to branch out to new artists."
12378,AmazonMusic,afrochica,4,0,"I would rate 4 stars. Sometimes i can't find songs that were previously in app. Also, i don't like that Amazon won't allow uploading songs from other libraries."
12379,AmazonMusic,Rykk Adams,1,0,last update keeps switching ftom offline music to online music. i dont want to stream. stop making mw pull over to the side of the road to switch baxk to offline. I am in offline mode but only music i never downloaded is playing.
12380,AmazonMusic,Tamia Cox,4,0,"Lately, the app has been stopping and prompting me to 'open app again' or send feedback. Ive tried uninstalling then reinstalling but that has not helped. Please fix and/ or advise."
12381,AmazonMusic,A Google user,4,0,great but of course you have to pay for premium to hear a lot of the latest music (depending on the artist) or older popular songs. otherwise i'd give 5 stars.
12382,AmazonMusic,Judy Zedalis,5,0,love Amazon music. listen in my car all the time. i live in mountains and there are very few changes to listen to. but i love the choices and continuous music.
12383,AmazonMusic,Douglas Ewen,5,0,"never had a problem with this app, easy to navigate, great selection. if you listen to a lot of indie/underground, probably not that best fit, but i like it a lot"
12384,AmazonMusic,Shreyas Kannan,3,0,The interface could have been better. The bottom circle showing the currently playing track is annoying. Adding an equalizer and improving the UI/UX will definitely earn 2 more stars.
12385,AmazonMusic,Larry Myers,5,0,"works great if you have prime, althought they want you to subcribe to the premium. some music only available to premium, but there is enough music for refular prime users to make it a 5 star app."
12386,AmazonMusic,A Google user,4,2,"some of the music im looking for is on the umlimited plan, but thats the way of many things. all aside i enjoy the service."
12387,AmazonMusic,Chase Matthew,1,1,you think Amazon video is bad! wait til you try Amazon Music! this is horrible even for a free trial! do not bother
12388,AmazonMusic,Chris Eagleson,5,0,Love this App if your a music LOVER then look no longer this is the app for you!!! Thank You Amazon keep on doing what your doing because it's working!!!!
12389,AmazonMusic,Lexi Rosado,2,0,"I can't access the app. I keep getting this "" please update Chome to continue using Amazon Music No matter how many times I update Chome, the app won't allow me to log in"
12390,AmazonMusic,Larry Rich,5,0,"I hesitated using, but a friend at work said just get it, you'll love it! He was right, best of all, there's no hidden costs or negative surprises!"
12391,AmazonMusic,Jimmy Lopez,5,0,I love this app. I use it all the time. Never had issues. The prime music is very good as well and there is a variety and diverse class of music without getting bored.
12392,AmazonMusic,Andy Shiue,2,0,"Frequently broken while streaming my music. Happen about once per hour. Have to quit the app, wait some minutes, and restart the app to have the music back."
12393,AmazonMusic,William Brownrigg,3,0,Not happy about having to pay more money to get the songs that I like and want to hear every day The upcharge for additional music after paying for Amazon Prime is a slap in the face for those of us that already have Prime
12394,AmazonMusic,Sarah Vlahovic,5,0,"amazing! I love the variety available for streaming, the consistency of quality streaming and the ease to find whatever I am currently in the mood for at the time."
12395,AmazonMusic,christopher shelton,4,8,"I love using Amazon music alot. I do, however, wish you would increase the playlist bank. I'm currently using one for my music and have ran out of space. So I am having to create an extra list for more songs. That is my only thought."
12396,AmazonMusic,Daniel Shoemaker,4,0,The song selections are great and its nice you can download them to your phone. The only issue is the app doesn't work well with Android auto and tends to freeze when trying to work with it througj my Sync3 interface.
12397,AmazonMusic,Jamel Wooten,5,0,"My GO-TO music player! All music streaming at 320kbps, great selection, awesome interface... and Amazon Music as a whole just serves its purpose for me. I'm soooo satisfied with their service and app :)"
12398,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,8,my only issue is that there are no rights to any music by the amazing group T00L! It may be due to the band being very protective of their music. But if that were remedied this app would be flawless! Having Alexa in the car has helped me continue to be a safe driver too! Thank You very much
12399,AmazonMusic,Abhyudit Neti,5,0,"I love the vast music collection available and the user interface makes the application so attractive to use. It's a definite ""must have"" application for music lovers."
12400,AmazonMusic,Darren Ginsch,2,0,"Was Great!!, spent alot time to build personnal play list of music of my liking. Then out of now where playlist get lost and music lost, have to do it all over again. ??????"
12401,AmazonMusic,James A.,3,0,I have playlist made but songs in the playlist keep getting erased from Amazon music and I have to go back and find the song again but now it's on a greatest hits album. It gets annoying after a couple times.
12402,AmazonMusic,Octavia Lockley,2,3,Removes music you already paid for due to licensing changes. Pushes you toward unlimited (paid subscription) at every turn. App errors (can't play or starts to duplicate the top navigation menu several times) cause it to need a restart.
12403,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,"I love Amazon Music! I can choose the actual music I want and play them by artist, album, song or just put it on shuffle and my music is played in random order."
12404,AmazonMusic,Mane Davis,5,0,Best music app so far. it's way more reliable that any other music app i've used......................Now that i really think of it it's the absolute best !!!! THANKS AMAZON MUSIC
12405,AmazonMusic,Nolan Richardson,4,0,I really like this app it is so good. But when I tried to listen to music on my phone I couldn't skip any of my songs because it says can't do that because my device is rooted. Anyone know how to fix this?
12406,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,1,"such an amazing app. plays all different songs that I love. can skip, rewind, like and dislike. perfection"
12407,AmazonMusic,sriman vignesh,4,0,"this app has UI lags like if i play suddenly another song the post or image will be lasts image (download also music) , it doesn't have complete local area music collection but all over the app is good for this prime membership"
12408,AmazonMusic,Zakatak,3,0,Would have made it 4 stars if pop and rap weren't shoved in my face. 5 stars if you could customize the interface. Otherwise it's pretty awesome.
12409,AmazonMusic,Laura Bruner,5,0,Love this app! Have found all the oldies I still love along with the latest greatest hits. It's easy to navigate and use on all my devices.
12410,AmazonMusic,Kerwin Terry,5,0,I'm very satisfied with the app so far. I look forward to pressing more buttons (exploring features) as I become more familiar with the app.
12411,AmazonMusic,Clyde Robertson,5,0,"Looks good, sounds good, works good. What else do you need from a music app. Is also competitive and obviously works well with echo."
12412,AmazonMusic,Tracy Moer,2,0,"I have purchased music that i cannot play,Shows up in purchased but cannot play selection.I have also had purchases disappear completely.Will not purchase no more music from you,unless resolved!!!"
12413,AmazonMusic,Russell Knight,5,0,unlimited is the best! It will find almost all the songs that I used to listen to back in the 80s. it cant find Radio Activity by Royal Cash.
12414,AmazonMusic,Jacyntha Lowery,5,0,App will not load. I've had this app for over a year & suddenly it will not work with my echo dot & will not load on my phone. Keeps saying its not allowed in my country.
12415,AmazonMusic,jitmanyu kohli,4,0,"4 stars only because some indian songs could not be found, though many are available. hopefully more songs shall be added. overall it is a very good platform."
12416,AmazonMusic,L Williams,5,0,I love that I make a purchase on Amazon & the music pops up in my app. I also love being able to stream music. I'm having a love affair with the app. lol. Really great!
12417,AmazonMusic,A Google user,1,0,I have to buy the music I'm looking for.i was invited to use this app because im a prime member. What's up with that? No asian pop music. I'm deleting this.
12418,AmazonMusic,Jacob Call,3,1,"when they take a song off it just stays in the playlist and buffers, also sometime when I click on a song it shuffles and plays different random song everytime I close it and retry, alot of bugs to fix still"
12419,AmazonMusic,Devan Fowler,5,0,"I've been a prime member for a while now and never realized i was sitting on this ad free gem!!! Good job guys, wish the unlimited didnt cost more but hey, im still winning!!!"
12420,AmazonMusic,A Google user,4,2,"Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I sometimes have a hard time finding the clean version of a song. I wish clean versions were the default. I can't put some stations on at work or when kids are around, which limits my choices. The kids station is clean, but doesn't always have my favorite songs."
12421,AmazonMusic,John Pearman,1,0,"OK for accessing the music you know, but poor for discovering new music and artists. The 'recommended' capability is pitiful. Spotify does this so much better."
12422,AmazonMusic,Ken Thomas,4,0,"Very good choice of music, but as a paid Amazon prime member you'd think you would get access to Amazon music unlimited, not be asked to pay for yet another subscription."
12423,AmazonMusic,laura edwards,5,0,"I love the selection. I can customize the music or just have my own awesome music playing. No not everything is available, but for the most part, what I want is free."
12424,AmazonMusic,Lacey Henry,3,0,"Some of the music I purchase and download to my device never actually ends up on my device. But the app thinks it is there, and doesn't let me try to download again."
12425,AmazonMusic,Jared Bingham,4,0,"decent music player. the albums sometimes jump back from free to listen to needing the pay version. beyond that, if you are on a playlist on the free version, if you encounter a paid song, the autoplay stops. highly annoying. but if you dont care about the selection, the ad-free music is pretty cool."
12426,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,2,"This app works great, just cause you're not smart enough to understand how to use it offline and adjust your settings to fit your preferences, blame yourself not Amazon. Also this included, Prime tv and 2 day shipping amongst other things, comparing it to Spotify is stupid! (you pay more for Spotify in one year then ALL Amazons services combined, get you head out of your ass! Smart phone, dumb usesers!!!...... Learn more then call and text.... Want more music??? Get unlimited then idiots..."
12427,AmazonMusic,Michael Reeds,5,0,"i happened to get a nice but limited exposure to AM through my cell provider. Glad I subscribed. Seeing things tht can't be had on Google Play Music, soundcloud, spotify. good work."
12428,AmazonMusic,Steve Brandt,3,3,"For a service that advertises having as many songs as does Amazon Music, their stations show remarkably little variety. On the All 80s station, I hear the same songs several times each day."
12429,AmazonMusic,Jackie Wysong,4,0,I listen to it all the time. Just wish I could download music to my Fitbit without purchasing the music. I listen to different songs based on my mood.
12430,AmazonMusic,Jamie See,4,0,"I love Amazon music but recently they've been removing a lot of songs from their catalog which is very disappointing for an avid music fan. If a song from 1997 pops into my head, and I want to listen to it right then, I pay enough for Amazon Music UNLIMITED to be able to do so!"
12431,AmazonMusic,Maxine Boger,4,0,"I love that there the Alexa feature, especially since I have an older vehicle, only reason I have 4 stars is because some music I like isn't available."
12432,AmazonMusic,Ravi Raman,4,0,Massive library but the prompts are not very intuitive (which could be a blessing in disguise). Not very helpful either for making playlists.
12433,AmazonMusic,Kathiria Burgos,4,0,I wish it had an option to go directly to he artist I follow. but overall a great app experience. It's great to be ablr to listen to my favorite songs offline â¤ï¸
12434,AmazonMusic,Lynn Thomas,4,0,"New to Amazon music, great so far. I listen to gospel and jazz selections. This is my go to app before work, while cleaning and exercising."
12435,AmazonMusic,Tammy Anderson,5,0,Love everything about it. Always has the songs I'm in the mood for. The playlist are always perfect. definitely beats all the other music apps.
12436,AmazonMusic,Ed Conley,4,0,Works well enough to use as a player. Very useful to use if you download music from Amazon. The one knock is that the play queue is difficult to find.
12437,AmazonMusic,Nabajyoti Sarma,4,0,"it is a good app with no unnecessary ads.Also good collection of music. Some issues with the controlling of the app like When i choose a song to listen ,it plays another."
12438,AmazonMusic,Lauren G Moore,5,4,Amazon music has changed my life. I've saved hundreds of dollars using this app instead of buying all the albums or dealing with annoying ads on YouTube. There are so many current artists and albums included with Prime membership. Highly recommend!
12439,AmazonMusic,T Mc,4,0,"I am still learning the app but it has been pretty good using it. Once I learn the use that satisfies me, I will probably bump up my ratings."
12440,AmazonMusic,Marisol Nava,3,0,There isn't that many selections unless you upgrade to unlimited plus when you do have the option to add the song to your music it can be taken away and you no longer have access to it because it was moved to unlimited music annoying.
12441,AmazonMusic,HailNavin,2,0,"Not a bad app, convenient at times.. except when the songs from the album are all out of order. Please fix this or lose another customer."
12442,AmazonMusic,Emily M,5,0,We love the amazon music app! it always works great! Just wish we didn't have to pay extra for unlimited when we already pay for amazon prime. But otherwise great!
12443,AmazonMusic,tito suave,3,0,just a heads up for anyone that has Amazon music and Amazon shopping app on your phone if you sign out of one it will sign you out of the other one deleting everything. it has many flaws and freezes all the time
12444,AmazonMusic,Willie Atkins,4,0,"Joined Prime for the free shipping on online orders, but Prime Video and Music are outstanding added bonuses. Not the widest selection, but definitely a solid variety and no ads interrupting the music."
12445,AmazonMusic,Amit Baskaran,3,1,"Good, but the songs suddenly gets paused for a second and then starts playing. Suddenly Alexa ad pops up and pauses the song."
12446,AmazonMusic,Earl Brown,1,0,"on my pixel2xl it will play a few songs and the jump to whatever the alphabetical first song i have on my phone. Also, shuffle keeps playing a limited number of tracks in a playlist."
12447,AmazonMusic,MrFloridan,3,0,"The user interface isn't bad, just odd. There also needs to be a radio station that play my favorites plus suggests new music for me. Slacker does that very well."
12448,AmazonMusic,Josh Arwood,5,0,"Way better than Pandora. I also like the fact that if I buy CDs on Amazon, most of the time I get a digital copy that I can listen to on the go as well. I like having a hard copy of my favorite music."
12449,AmazonMusic,Evan Stuey,1,0,"download your songs, and have to reopen the app for every song because it demands data to play yhe next song. also deletes your downloaded music after 3 months. hope you werent looking forward to songs you downloaded..."
12450,AmazonMusic,Tabatha Long,5,0,Part of Prime experience and truthfull I love it. It doesnt eat up a lot of my data and my playlists can play in the background. I truly enjoy the selections.
12451,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,6,"User friendly platform with obscure favorites readily available. Not personally super versed in all aspects yet as I have not fully subscribed. I actually was introduced bc I couldn't get the soundtrack to Patriot out of my head and just had to buy Micheal Dorman's ""French Gun"". Amazon is a juggernaut at the leading edge of everything... and Music is no different."
12452,AmazonMusic,Robert Engel,5,0,It's cool if you have prime. Wish they'd leave my library alone and stop putting everything in unlimited. But as far as something extra with my prime account it's amazing.
12453,AmazonMusic,Daljeet Singh,3,4,The reason why i am rating three because of two reasons. 1. Majority of the tracks of famous artists are missing. 2. the search music is too generic for an brand like Amazon it pulls up all the list of irrevelant songs of a different artist if you do a name search.
12454,AmazonMusic,Namon Houston,1,1,this app constantly freezes. Its frozen right now. It plays songs that I have not selected. offline features barely works.
12455,AmazonMusic,Raghavendra Siddhanti,3,1,"For Indian audiences there is a plenty of bollywood music but there is no classical music, neither Hindustani nor Carnatic, this is a major flaw."
12456,AmazonMusic,Ed Rabbitt,5,8,I love music and I love Amazon Music. Nothing comes close to the quality and features that this app has. Nothing!
12457,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,2,best Music App I've EVER used! I should've listened to my hubby a long time ago and let YouTube Premium go! Amazon Music Rocks! ðŸ˜ðŸ˜»
12458,AmazonMusic,Dhruv Shah,1,0,"App stops playing music on streaming when the phone is locked and screen is off. Do something about it , as it is taking away the experience."
12459,AmazonMusic,Kam Von,3,0,"love being able to listen and make my own playlist with a wide selection however if you want the really good songs, that will cost an extra $8 a month on top of your prime membership..."
12460,AmazonMusic,amarjots sandhu,2,0,"hi developers,in the last update my app is behaving weird, whenever i touch a song from any playlist it plays some other song not the one i selected for(sometimes previous track sometimes next song) please fix it."
12461,AmazonMusic,Jennifer Antonetty,5,0,"Absolutely brilliant!!! I initially downloaded Amazon music as a promotion and upon promo expiration date, purchased the monthly subscription. Highly recommended."
12462,AmazonMusic,James Cole,4,0,I rarely use this for more than downloading my purchases...which it doesn't do smoothly. I give a little grace since I may be ignorant of some options.
12463,AmazonMusic,Christopher Maszerowski,4,0,I haven't been able to find a song the database doesn't have! Sound quality is excellent too! Does however stop playing at times for no reason..
12464,AmazonMusic,Brian Peruta,2,0,as time goes on I get more and more disappointed. I'm looking for another music player that will play all my local music. sorry Amazon. this ride might be over for me
12465,AmazonMusic,john bradley,1,0,"Clumsy for moving tracks around, inflexible and uncooperative when moving my 1300 tracks over to Samsung Music which is slicker and far more agile in moving tracks around. Outraged and clunky. Don't be this app, be more Samsung."
12466,AmazonMusic,Shane Bennett,5,0,"This is our go to app for music, works great and can find pretty much anybody we want to hear. Helps make the alot of the everyday tasks melt into enjoyable time. We dig it."
12467,AmazonMusic,grant w,2,0,"for once would be nice to get something for free, pay enough for Amazon and all the other things, anything I seem to want to watch or listen to costs more and more and more."
12468,AmazonMusic,Sanjay Rajan,4,0,"One of the good music apps available in the market. Maybe if they could get more of the regional music, I would never turn back to my other music apps.Keep it up."
12469,AmazonMusic,Prachi Shah,2,0,I've been using Apple Music and they have an amazing and myriad collection of songs in the Browse and For You section. Amazon Music lacks that variety. So I hope thats taken care of!
12470,AmazonMusic,Steve Brown,3,2,"Not all albums I'd expect on Unlimited Music, and have come across bands that have music scattered (not grouped together in any way)."
12471,AmazonMusic,A Google user,4,0,"It's been really good. I love the music selection. the only draw back is you never actually own the ""free"" songs that you get with your prime membership:("
12472,AmazonMusic,Matthew Means,4,0,"I enjoy the stations they already have grouped together. However, I have yet to notice any difference in music selections based on my song rating preferences."
12473,AmazonMusic,Yash Upadhyay,5,0,now no need to store or download songs from pirated sites. neighborhood has been promoting a lot of piracy which needs to stopped. million songs now on Amazon music anytime and anywhere.
12474,AmazonMusic,Pratik,1,0,Amazon prime music has very limited music library. the user interface is pretty bad. Next and rewind buttons are pretty small and makes it difficult to navigate.
12475,AmazonMusic,Jamie Browne,3,0,When it works its great but we pay for a subscription that is supposed to allow for Amazon music to stream on multiple devices. However it never actually allows us to do this which is quite frustrating.
12476,AmazonMusic,Austin Hodges,5,0,"great music selection and available on too many devices to list. I use it while working, studying, working out, hanging out with the family... etc."
12477,AmazonMusic,Monica Brown,2,0,"clunky format, free music selection constantly dwindling, doesn't keep track of your stations, keeps moving you to different screens rather than keeping track of where you are."
12478,AmazonMusic,steve warburton,1,0,"am very disappointed. took out amazon prime expecting so much music to be available. instead, prime just has bits and pieces of artists catalogues... their older crappier stuff. should have gone with spotify paid. grrrrrrr."
12479,AmazonMusic,Ericka Earles,5,0,"I had Pandora for a long while and decided to try amazon music since I already had amazon prime and I LOVE it! I permanently switched to unlimited streaming and cancelled Pandora, plus the cost is cheaper!!"
12480,AmazonMusic,A Google user,2,3,"slow ,no lyrics,no option to search music from current playing artist....may want to use deezzer for while to see how smooth it is.only reason changed to Amzon music is for the use of Alexa through all rooms ...family say the music is limited compared to deezer or spotify."
12481,AmazonMusic,Cygnus Xten,2,0,"Need to increase snapiness of app interaction as it is slow, if you could deliver response of app as good as Spotify it would be tremendous for music lovers like us. Stop improving Alexa ai in app and start focussing on its responsiveness."
12482,AmazonMusic,A Google user,4,0,"Is ok, but no need for the annoying ""rate app"" request popup, or the full screen ""try unlimited"" offer. If i want to rate and app or upgrade an app i will do it myself."
12483,AmazonMusic,Julie Manuel,1,0,issue with playback over bluetooth both with my car and headset. it's as though it's buffering but happens even on downloaded and offline music. it seems to be an android/ Amazon music app issue.
12484,AmazonMusic,Jillian Pelechaty,2,0,Music lost 2 times. Had to re download all my music 2x in the last 3 weeks. Also the homescreen widget disappeared from my phone and is no where to be found.
12485,AmazonMusic,Jonah Primrose,2,0,"It was good until they changed the services for Prime Members. Now I don't think it's that great personally, but it is free so... There is that."
12486,AmazonMusic,Tony Nieves,3,0,This app doesnt work well with the Galaxy s10. I've used on my last galaxy with no issues. I'm a bit disappointed because I pay for the unlimited.
12487,AmazonMusic,Wendy Zampardi,4,0,"Works well, doesn't use up too much data or battery while streaming. Has a sleep feature to shut itself off on a timer. Asks me to upgrade constantly."
12488,AmazonMusic,ujjwal utsav,3,0,"Can be improved to better app. lyrics Matching is missing, lyrics is missing, karaoke mode missing, auto tag editor for offline music is missing infact it doesn't handle mp3 files saved on phone any well."
12489,AmazonMusic,Viren Patel,2,0,im not happy with the service. im already a prime member. then too it is showing that. im not a prime members please solve this problem it a serious issue ðŸ˜•ðŸ˜¡
12490,AmazonMusic,A Google user,2,1,"It's good when it works, but my playlists keep dropping out and/or freezing, whether or not they are downloaded."
12491,AmazonMusic,Cierra J,5,4,"Love the app. No ads with your prime membership. Can listen to full albums or a station with similar music. I dont have the Unlimited subscription, so there's some music I can't access, but I enjoy everything that's available with my prime membership."
12492,AmazonMusic,Santosh Suvasish,3,0,"Alexa is good. Amazon got a good song collection. They still need to work on their app, mostly on download feature. Better to use Wynk music app,which comes free with Airtel or Saavn."
12493,AmazonMusic,Adam Shaw,1,9,"If I am already paying for this with Prime, why are there advertisements? Why is it when I pin something in Prime music as a favorite, it suddenly goes behind the Unlimited pay wall? The greed is ridiculous!"
12494,AmazonMusic,khronosIscariot,1,0,"Very disappointing. although the library is excellent, my purchases consistently fail to download to my phone. customer service has been no help at all."
12495,AmazonMusic,Angie R,5,0,"love how they have so many different Choices of music, last night I listened to old school janet jackson, sade,and whodini. classic music is the best. I really enjoy itðŸ™‚."
12496,AmazonMusic,a l l i s f u l l o f l o v e,5,0,Finally. A music app where you can listen to songs that you ACTUALLY want ro hear. This makes them better than the rest. Well done. I love it! Thank you so much.
12497,AmazonMusic,Nate Todd,3,0,it's pretty good. I wish there were more artist stations and that the stations had better variety. there are many subgenres of Metal and not ever station needs Slipknot.
12498,AmazonMusic,BupSahn,4,0,Great app. Easy to use and of course Amazon Music is amazing. I do find not being able to save stations in 'My Music' very frustrating though.
12499,AmazonMusic,A Google user,4,0,"My only true complaint is the lack variety within stations. Just like a real radio station, you will hear the same 10 songs over and over, no matter how many months go by."
12500,AmazonMusic,Ricardo Nova,1,0,"After taking months to build my playlists, one day it decides to log me out. Then, after getting back in, all of my playlists have glbeen deleted."
12501,AmazonMusic,Justin Burnette,1,0,"This app is not very intuitive, you guys should really work on your user interface. so many times I want to give it up and go to spotify with ads."
12502,AmazonMusic,Ken Cureton,5,0,Can't begin my day without this app. Thanks Amazon and don't stop this service! If you stop this service I will have to unsubscribe to Prime.
12503,AmazonMusic,Peter Fleming,4,0,"Nice to have with my Prime membership. App works well but I wish the ""home screen"" User Interface wasn't so cluttered. Possibly an optional UI could be added?"
12504,AmazonMusic,Jerome Moore,5,0,"I can find all the songs that were/are my favorites.....a wide and varied selection to choose from...anyone from 8ball & MJG to Sade & Dwele. Simply put, I LOVE AMAZON MUSIC"
12505,AmazonMusic,aditya mishra,4,0,The songs quality are good. But you should work on your UI it sucks!! I would have given a five star but due to lag in UI I am giving you all four stars
12506,AmazonMusic,Joshua B,2,0,"The app has been great most of the time I've been using it. Until this most recent update, where it's constantly closing. please go back or fix"
12507,AmazonMusic,sarah ledet,1,0,I loved amazon music before. especially since I pay over 100 a year for that benefit as well now they want more money and keep taking music that used to be on my play lists and want to charge me for them.
12508,AmazonMusic,Curtis Kiland,5,0,A really good and flexible listening experience. Not everything is on Amazon. Sometimes things get removed from Amazon. The paid version is defintaly worth it.
12509,AmazonMusic,carl r,4,0,good music selection. app easy to use. sometimes the album hangs while opening and the list of songs doesn't come up but the album will play. couple of other routes will display the songs on the album. there seems to be a minimum amount of wireless usage required otherwise the service shuts down.
12510,AmazonMusic,A Google user,4,0,some bugs issues are to be sloved ...but rest of the features are pretty good ....just a request to add an equaliser option in the settings of amazon music...so that would be very helpful ...
12511,AmazonMusic,John Potelle,1,0,This app sucks for playing music stored on the device. Especially in AndroidAuto mode. It rarely updates metadata on newly added MP3s and there's no way to force a rescan of local files.
12512,AmazonMusic,Tushar Kawadkar,1,0,"While playing, music automatically keeps pausing. Need to open the app and then resume playing by pressing Play/Pause button. Downloaded songs also sometimes doesn't play."
12513,AmazonMusic,Philip Harvey,4,0,good selection across all genres. easy to find What you are looking for. Just wish they didn't keep trying to get me to listen to things I'm not interested in.
12514,AmazonMusic,t dibart,5,0,"i love this app! you can listen to songs in your cloud without purchasing & dont push you to purchase, so i do easily when i want to download whether its a single or entire albumn the prices are right on!"
12515,AmazonMusic,Roger Sutlow,5,0,"Many Songs and Albums are available, if you don't see what you want, just go to search. You can also download to your music settings. Well worth the subscription!"
12516,AmazonMusic,STUART HANSLIP,1,0,This app constantly disappoints. Very slow to update and sync and frustratingly none of the uodates from Amazon have made things any better. Sort it out Amazon!!!!!!!!!
12517,AmazonMusic,Najiel Grant,5,0,This is by far the best music app I've ever had. You do have to pay to have Amazom Music Unlimited to get some of the songs but without it you still get a BIG amount of music to listen and choose from.
12518,AmazonMusic,Jared Martinez,5,0,"really like amazon music, if you got prime and dont want to pay for other music services it's a great free music app. sometimes it crashes, but that could be my phone."
12519,AmazonMusic,Slaughters Mcgee,3,11,"I really do love this app and want give 5 stars but the playstore is pushy and wants a rating now, but I can't figure out how to listen to my library while im offline. Consider this a 5 star essentially. Im just being anal retentive."
12520,AmazonMusic,A Google user,2,0,"love buying from Amazon and working for Amazon but this app has a long journey to be comparable to Spotify or even Apple music. It's slow, laggy and doesn't have that Spotify smoothness."
12521,AmazonMusic,aditya agarwal,4,0,it's really very good but the user interface could be a little bit better . Also it would be helpful if you added a personalized station based on our most played songs or the liked ones.
12522,AmazonMusic,Zachery Hunter,2,0,"every now and then when my phone updates, Amazon Music does not even open or load. I need to go thru uninstallation/reinstall and then get all my music back.. kind of frustrating tho for real"
12523,AmazonMusic,Ryan Donovan,5,0,"Amazing app. If I could give just one minor request, it would be to add an alarm clock option. Then it would be a six star app. Great job."
12524,AmazonMusic,Garen Holman,3,0,"I can't give it 5 stars because some of the music I download just disappears. Sometimes you can retrieve it but a lot of times no go. Other than that, I would give it a 5."
12525,AmazonMusic,Rip Booker,5,0,"Personally, I use Amazon music as my preference for my digital listening. I still buy physical product sometimes. Its nice to get digital copies."
12526,AmazonMusic,Quantier Loy,4,2,I loooove this PRIME perk! no commercial interruptions kinda life! The variety and playlists are great. Best algorithm for choosing what I might like to hear from any streaming service I have tried! My only issue is that it has some trouble playing songs already downloaded when they come up via playlist or station. It's a random glitch..not consistent.
12527,AmazonMusic,Sai Tejas,3,1,Why is re-ordering songs such a pain? Take a note from google play music on user interface. Yours has a ton to develop on.
12528,AmazonMusic,S Dixon,5,0,I love the variety of music. Amazon Music provides suggestions each day based on my previous selections. These are wonderful for getting ready in the mornings.
12529,AmazonMusic,Natalia Martyn,5,0,"music is a very important part of my life, i listen to it daily, this app is the best music app i have come across. i wouldn't use anything else. i use it across all of my devices, its easy to navigate, you can create your own playlists or listen to others, the stations are great for discovering new music."
12530,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,"I have been using Amazon music from the very beginning. love it. I was a little upset when you added the plus, cause it took away from what we were already paid for."
12531,AmazonMusic,Mark Humphrey-Ali,5,0,"Alexa along with Amazon music gives me all the music I need. How easy it is. just ask and it's there. Instant music. Put along side my vinyl listening, makes things complete"
12532,AmazonMusic,Ethan Agre,5,0,hands down the best free music app available! you can download your songs so you dont have to use data to jam out! if your like the the rest of America and have Amazon prime the premium music account is cheaper ans very worth it
12533,AmazonMusic,A Google user,1,7,"has been problematic lately. I have great internet connectivity and speed. yet the music stays ""loading"""
12534,AmazonMusic,Cherry Pie,3,0,"it's OK. Someday, they'll make a way to listen to the stations, without the ability to download songs. Because THAT'S where the money is. Charge people to download each song, but not to just listen to a station without having to keep the app open. That's what I'm waiting for. Good idea? YEs??"
12535,AmazonMusic,jackie garcia,4,0,I love this but I think the bonus tracks from albums should be added on here and I think it should have a feature where I can select multiple songs at once (like if I want to add some to a playlist)
12536,AmazonMusic,Krista Prosser,3,0,"I would give this a much higher rating except when I pick an artist, the app only plays the same 30 songs each time. Why can't it play all of their songs?"
12537,AmazonMusic,Michael Paton,4,0,"love it, bit sad Lemonade isnt on here but my God from Spotify's new update and the missing artists on Tidal, this app is a life saver! keep the interface or UI the same and you'll have this guy as a customer ;)"
12538,AmazonMusic,ishtar0077,1,1,"why give us hard time when we want to buy song, I need subscription to buy it from you Amazon.. sometimes I can't buy song unless I subscribe.."
12539,AmazonMusic,Chris Garris,3,0,"Only problem for me, and I'm sure many others, is the lack of music. More current metal and prog/instrumental bands would be a great addition."
12540,AmazonMusic,ian robinson,2,0,"highly annoying as I pay for prime but this is plagued with adverts pop up screens to pay for unlimited music, also near the top of most searches it priotitises unlimited tracks or albums that you cannot listen to. Very annoying"
12541,AmazonMusic,Sean Robertson,5,0,Amazing amount of music available. Most of my family and friends use the service. I always recommend Amazon to anyone who loves their Music.
12542,AmazonMusic,A Google user,2,2,"I don't like the fact that I'm paying an extra 4.99 monthly. That's extra 4.99 on top of my prime was supposed to help with playing the songs requested. Then suddenly it wants me to upgrade to unlimited and not play the songs I listened to previously. I am so frustrated, I may cancel something."
12543,AmazonMusic,BrandonBrown8653 Bbrown91915,5,1,love this app it has all the music i want ro hear i deleted all my other music apps. Amazon Music is all I need!!!!!!!
12544,AmazonMusic,Nigel Dodd,4,0,"Good choices of music modern classic rock pop country you name it it has it. What the bind is streaming single person only, very expensive multi person which seems to be an add on to unlimited as well !"
12545,AmazonMusic,A Google user,3,0,"I don't always seem to get the actual music I've quite clearly played for. As far as the music app goes, no complaints, it's perfectly functional..."
12546,AmazonMusic,Lendal Atwood,2,0,user interface is confusing. a lot of music not accessible. good that songs can be downloaded....sometimes. glad this is free with prime because not worth much else otherwise.
12547,AmazonMusic,Faith Rivera,5,0,Amazon Prime is amazing then add Amazon Music.....winning! The music selection is impressive I have yet to find a song or artist not on Amazon Music. Keep it up Amazon I am a fan.
12548,AmazonMusic,Victoria c,4,1,I wish that they would stop making songs unavailable in their Library after I've already added to my music. Other than that I love this app so much
12549,AmazonMusic,Vincent Ruta,2,0,I need music you have the truth and get from them won't play on their stuff that's offenses Used to be it would import your library from windows and it would import your library from Apple C didn't have to buy the same thing twice .
12550,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,"l love the variety of music l can listen to, especially Christian music. l do run into problems sometime with the music, but it seems to work itself out."
12551,AmazonMusic,Ste DNI,4,1,Great service but recently cleared my entire cache without asking me. A warning would be appreciated next time. Cheers.
12552,AmazonMusic,A Google user,4,0,It seems there is every option available. Sometimes I want today's hits. sometimes country. sometimes nature sounds. And I can time it. Wonderful.
12553,AmazonMusic,Keith Bell,4,6,Amazing app! I love it and I use it every single day. The only problem is that the app does not have every song I have searched for. If we can put the Folarin mixtape from Wale and Slow down by Ne-yo(only with others) on there then a five star rating from me will be in the near future
12554,AmazonMusic,Tim Davenport,5,2,"My one and only true music all-in-one app. There are just too many PRO's list. If you are serious about your music, and you want the world of music at your fingertips, this app and deciding on the cheap monthly subscription is the thing for you. Hands down, the best set up, and options for a family too. Can't beat it!"
12555,AmazonMusic,jim merid,3,0,Selection of music is pretty weak! Lot of tracks that are only available to monthly subscribers. I just want to pay for the music not the subscription!
12556,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,the dashboard simplicity really helps me find new music and classic reminders of why the elder people say the music of today is not real music like back in the day . its helping bridge the roads that make amphibious vehicles obsolete.
12557,AmazonMusic,Nicholas Doyle,5,0,"At the end of the day Amazon have an enormous share of the digital marketplace, I am a Prime member,Dire Straits sung ""Why worry"" with Amazon I don't."
12558,AmazonMusic,Paul Gosling,3,0,For an app used by so many people I am sometimes surprised by the relative immaturity of some features and overly complicated navigation. On the plus side the integrated lyrics is a nice feature.
12559,AmazonMusic,Seth Stewart,2,0,Used to be top notch. Now when I select songs it doesn't do anything. You have to push the song several times before it plays anything on Samsung Note 8.
12560,AmazonMusic,A Google user,4,12,Really good app. I have only one criticism and that is that sometimes Amazon takes songs away even after you download them. It is very irritating when you expect to listen to a song and it's not there.
12561,AmazonMusic,Asha Patel,5,2,Sound quality is very very good and I like the thing about this app is that it works with voice command and have all music from oldest to latest ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜‰
12562,AmazonMusic,Amber Norman,5,0,"Simply put, I love this app!! All the songs I want and love are here and I can find/learn about other songs from recommendations."
12563,AmazonMusic,Sherman Robinson,1,0,"Horrible app. Cannot upload my own music with ease, I will be switching to another music app. Do not waste your time with this app!!"
12564,AmazonMusic,Suraj Suresh,3,0,"Song variety is amazing, but the app loads them very slow. I know I have a good connection but the app cannot load them fast enough."
12565,AmazonMusic,Halen Effinger,4,0,"it's pretty good but occasionally i have a problem with adding one album and getting copies of every song. cant delete one song, because theyre obviously the same song."
12566,AmazonMusic,A Google user,3,0,Enjoy listening to music. pretty good playlists and stations to choose from. worst downfall is it seems the same music gets played over and over again and the only over and over again i like is by nelly and Tim McGraw
12567,AmazonMusic,abhinav malik,4,0,the app is good. although it takes time for latest songs to come on it when it comes to Bollywood/ punjabi music. but international music is very up to date and great.
12568,AmazonMusic,Chris O,4,0,"love it, just wish they would check all of their music to make sure it is edited. I know that's a hard task to keep up with but that's why they make the money they do other than that, love it."
12569,AmazonMusic,Caroline harris,5,0,"LOVE LOVE LOVE! works great, is easy to navigate and create playlists, find your newest songs, or shuffle all. I feel fortunate to have it :)"
12570,AmazonMusic,BDog Pound,3,0,"Good music selection. App is very difficult to use, find songs and make playlists. Playlists you make on the website do not sync with app so you have to do it twice"
12571,AmazonMusic,A Google user,4,0,so far I like Amazon music! Thank you for your very inspiring creativity. I can tell there is thought and effort put in to your music section of Amazon.
12572,AmazonMusic,Carole Eddyshaw,5,0,I love Amazon music they always have music I search for when I try to down grade to the Â£3.99 package it wont let me or when I ask Alexa she asks for a code and I don't know how to get it . I do stream music to my TV
12573,AmazonMusic,Jean Stetzler,5,0,I love this service! I'm able to listen to about anything I want. I don't mind paying 7.99 a month for this because I'm a fan of many types of music and I'm an older individual who isn't real thrilled with a lot of the most recent music. It is a joy .
12574,AmazonMusic,C Mott,4,0,"great music listening. However, when I choose radio version I still get explicit. Otherwise, I'm enjoying the trial when I have time to listen."
12575,AmazonMusic,Sean Doyle,5,0,Pretty bloody great. I do wish all the albums I bought on CD and Vinyl would be represented properly though. Sometimes only one or two tracks per album are playable.
12576,AmazonMusic,Kim Lee,1,0,"every time I use Amazon music, there are 3 or 4 songs that have been taken off. I rarely use it anymore bc the music I like the most is removed daily."
12577,AmazonMusic,Clint Marcus,4,0,"Good layout, but being able to remove songs and other items from your library is inordinately difficult. Having items pop back in after they've been deleted is extrely frustrating."
12578,AmazonMusic,Grey Brooks,5,0,"Great app, I use it daily for music. I've tried Pandora, Spotify, and Google play music, and I prefer this app for ease of use and selection."
12579,AmazonMusic,Lee K,5,0,Excellent when used in conjunction with your prime membership account. Listen to millions of songs albums and playlists (Amazon calls them stations). Good stuff!!
12580,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,"really good selection of music and links in very well with multiple devices such as echoes, mobile and fire tv. can take what you are listening too into different rooms. spot on"
12581,AmazonMusic,Nms Test,1,1,always keeps on buffering. It can't even able to play music without buffering its better to play youtube videos than playing music on this app not an issue with internet speed its this appðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ 
12582,AmazonMusic,Cindy Valliere,5,0,i love listening to my Christian music doing housework or yardwork or just relaxing in the sun or in the pool. no comercials. LOVE it.
12583,AmazonMusic,Hermione Lovegood,5,0,It's a good app for listening to music. I've got nothing negative to say about it. The amazon subscription is quite reasonably priced. I am completely satisfied with the app
12584,AmazonMusic,Michelle Gibson,3,0,"Music almost skips ahead by a bit, so the song sounds weird. Not sure if I want to keep this app. Should I uninstall and upload again?"
12585,AmazonMusic,sky puppy,5,0,"better than I hoped for ,don't want to be with out it now,be carefull or you will find yourself- shopping for New Bluetooth speakers!"
12586,AmazonMusic,Forrest Hurley,4,0,Nice selection. Good options for playback though it can occasionally hang which requires manually stopping and restarting. I especially enjoy offline listening.
12587,AmazonMusic,Jose Santos,5,0,"Really enjoy this app. lots of free music for me. Just which all my favorite bands were free tho. still, I'll give them 5 stars...baaamm!"
12588,AmazonMusic,Vicki Hall,5,0,"All the music you want to listen to. Very good playback on phone, tablets or PC's. Easy way to have custom playlists or add your own special songs."
12589,AmazonMusic,Delfin Clark,5,0,"Very responsive, excellent selection of music, quite intuitively assembles playlists which have followed alongthe lines of my own personal selections and gendres...LOVE IT...STRONGLY RECCOMEND IT AS WELL!!!!!!!"
12590,AmazonMusic,Mark Tait,1,1,any song u want to listen to requires unlimited subscription. if you listen to it more than once when its not. it magically becomes apart of unlimited subscription
12591,AmazonMusic,T Finn,3,0,"Navigation is slow as an app to play your own stored music, because it keeps trying to get you to use the online music options. There's no way to disable this."
12592,AmazonMusic,Erica Smith,5,0,"love amazon music, can listen to my music anywhere and you can find almost anything. i use the kids music playlists all the time for my toddlers. so convenient."
12593,AmazonMusic,Lindsay Hnekel,5,0,"love that there are no commercials. but, if you listen often, the stations basically are a long playlist and you will hear the same songs over and over."
12594,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,"endless supply of music, listen to your hearts content, its good how you can make the playlists so easily and that you can download so quickly and listen later, hugr variety of music available xoxo"
12595,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,Music when I want it and need it. The kind of music I love and downloads are really easy. I love the choices I can get and listen to at any time. A great App!
12596,AmazonMusic,Isobelle Cate,5,0,Amazon Music has been my go to music platform for years now. I find all of the music I like here and learn about new artists they curate. Keep it up!
12597,AmazonMusic,Ryan Miller,3,0,would rate higher but lately every time I open the app I get ad for either the subscription for music service (even though already have prime) or to rate the app. Just let me be old and buy mp3s in peace
12598,AmazonMusic,Owen Clarke,5,0,"My experience has been 95% positive! Easy to navigate and plenty of music to browse. My play list grows with newly discovered artist, new and old!"
12599,AmazonMusic,HUNTS POINT,5,0,Gets the job done. Ease of on screen use and quickly accessible playlists. Simple way to select any current or very old songs for use in your personal playlists.
12600,AmazonMusic,Todd Christbearer,2,0,it used to work great. i got a new phone and now i can't get any of my albums to remain accessible. I download them to the SD card and the next day they disappear.
12601,AmazonMusic,n.shravanthi gail,4,0,"Good music app, but needs more variations and availability of all kinds of music, old to the new. Because some songs u can't find it on this app."
12602,AmazonMusic,Paul Lindsay,1,0,just purchased SOLDIER song...had to install app. song wont play isnt even their...but loads off opportunities to sign up to monthly fee....now another half hour of my life lost whilst i sort it with Amazon
12603,AmazonMusic,Preference Robinson,5,1,Amazon Music is the bomb!! Way better than that other streaming service and a lot more user friendly too. imbglad i can make my own playlist instead of listening to the same song over and over on a station!!!!
12604,AmazonMusic,A Google user,4,0,I keep forgetting I can close out or chat while listening to music. lol. but I like it :) just not that I don't have access to all music.
12605,AmazonMusic,Nadine Girouard,5,0,"I do enjoy having music at my finger tips. I do think since i already pay i shouldn't have to pay more for certain songs but, in time."
12606,AmazonMusic,Janos Berta,4,0,"Browsing and navigation is not the best, however the quality and the selection is brilliant. In android auto it has no searchinh or browsing but it sounds awesome."
12607,AmazonMusic,Tellya Later,5,0,I love this app! Easy access to music I like! I enjoy being able to make an offline playlist to enjoy without needing an internet connection.
12608,AmazonMusic,Sarah Boyd,2,0,very limited music selection unless you feel like paying an additional fee on top of the prime fee I already pay. Its always about how much more money can I wrangle out of every.
12609,AmazonMusic,Trey Robinson,3,0,"pretty good selection of music but i can only listen from one device at time. If my wife is listening in her car i can't listen in my car without paying more money, like I'm not paying Amazon enough for prime"
12610,AmazonMusic,Benjamin Ward,4,0,"Pretty great. More control over where to add music to currently playing song list would be great. Like ""Add to end of queue"" and ""Add after current track""."
12611,AmazonMusic,raeofsun1979,2,0,"Constant aggressive advertising in the app to upgrade to their premium service is really, really irritating. Why should you have to say no more than once?"
12612,AmazonMusic,Jonathan Palmer,2,0,"Too many repeats. Also when it says ""todays hits"" but the songs are well over 5 years old, you start wondering if the algorithm is poor quality ."
12613,AmazonMusic,Guruprasad Bhat,1,0,"if you update, downloaded songs will be automatically deleted, need to re-downlaoded. not sure what kind of bug or feature is this :( . never upadte !!! caution"
12614,AmazonMusic,Paula Kelly-Parks,5,0,I use this music app for all my music! I have Amazon Prime and I can download any and all the music I want. Playback on my Alexa devices is smooth and effortless.
12615,AmazonMusic,fester6870,2,0,amazon music has deteriorated in selection over the past 3 years. now it's trying to upsell music unlimited. as of prime membership isn't good enough to pay into anymore.
12616,AmazonMusic,Brian W,4,0,Amazon music is one of the things that keeps me subscribed to amazon prime. Decent app but it does take it forever to figure out that there is no internet service before it switches to offline mode.
12617,AmazonMusic,Yatheendra Mouli,2,0,"App has many technical issues, one of them is if you get logged out of the app(say the paweight.ssword is changed) you will loose some of your content like created playlists and downloaded songs"
12618,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,It's great! I can find anything on Amazon music from oldest to newest. Which is fantastic because I go from classical to rap in spam of five minutes.
12619,AmazonMusic,Eric Campbell,2,0,Be nice to create my own station. collection is good but found that when i chose a station it played the same song is the same order. Not enough variety.
12620,AmazonMusic,Matthew Moses,3,0,Much nicer than Pandora. Wish I had the option of clearing recommendations from browse list. Some are WAY off the mark. 5 stars if not for that.
12621,AmazonMusic,A Google user,4,0,"Overall the app is good, Alexa is great but I think the app is somewhat not stable enough. It cease to respond sometimes. Recommended to solve the issue."
12622,AmazonMusic,Oli Simmons,2,0,limited unless you pay more. You already pay for Prime but to get access to certain artists you have pay an additional subscription fee! Better off with Spotify and listen throigh adverts!
12623,AmazonMusic,Tamara Pillipow,2,0,I enjoy the music on here but the library is limited compared to other services. The fact that more money is being demanded for more options when we are already paying a service fee is a huge deterrent!
12624,AmazonMusic,Trisha Anderson,4,0,"I really love Amazon Music, I just wish they wouldn't get rid of songs after having them in their library for so long. That is why I paid the extra amount."
12625,AmazonMusic,Someone WhoCares,1,7,IT WON'T LET ME ENABLE IT ON MY PHONE. IT DOESN'T TELL ME THAT I HAVE INSUFFICIENT STORAGE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. WORST APP EVER!
12626,AmazonMusic,John Firmin,2,0,it was good for a little while. Now I'm not allowed to listen to music until I pay for the unlimited. kind of lame to have this as a perk with the prime account.
12627,AmazonMusic,A Google user,4,0,"Dont like fact that some songs I have downloaded are discontinued and not available. if I have downloaded them, how can you cancel them! Also , is it really necessary to extra bill for music? I enjoy your service, but, isn't that nickel and dimeing!!!"
12628,AmazonMusic,A Google user,4,0,"I prefer Amazon Music over any other streaming service that I've used in the past. itunes/apple, pandora etc... It's a wonderful experience in music... No cap."
12629,AmazonMusic,A Google user,3,0,good quality music and an extensive catalogue but dont be fooled by the free use when opting for amazon prime. Only some albums and songs are free. the rest you have to subscribe to the music deal seperatly at 9.99 a month
12630,AmazonMusic,Pamela Jimenez,2,0,"repeats the same music and too many channels that have to be paid for, even though you pay for prime annually! probably won't renew!"
12631,AmazonMusic,R Wallis,5,0,Love the sations option- click on the station showing an artist you like and other artists you might like are also played -opens up a lot more music to me.
12632,AmazonMusic,Jason Haynes,5,0,"I purchased the family plan. For $15 a month my wife, my son, my brother and myself all have unlimited access to new and old music alike. It's an exceptional value and loads of fun!"
12633,AmazonMusic,A Google user,1,1,Dire! Would be good if it didn't keep dropping out every 5mins until it eventually wakes up. Truly rubbish coding going on here!
12634,AmazonMusic,Terry Gowan,5,0,Great app for music! Playlists are easy to set up. Best feature is the ability to set up playlists for offline listening. Awesome for traveling!
12635,AmazonMusic,shivam bhavsar,4,1,initially was the best thing on the planet! but from few days im not able to open it and i have reinstall everytime. please help with a solution
12636,AmazonMusic,Joy Mukherjee,4,1,"Prime music have good quality content. It contains songs from different genres, moreover it also contains very old songs to new songs. Given Playlists are not as good as Spotify but it does the job anyways. UI is not great, but since i can enjoy high quality sings on this i haven't deducted a star for that. Edit: Removing one star, Because it doesn't replace lock screen with album art. AMAZON IF YOU LISTENING THEN PLZ ADD THIS FEATURE. WE NEED ALBUM ART IN LOCKSCREEN BACKGROUND please.."
12637,AmazonMusic,Pritish Patra,4,0,"Great app, but sometimes searching music is a bit of problem, as sometimes the online albums doesn't load and the app has to be restarted to search and open the album again."
12638,AmazonMusic,Steven Murray,4,0,"Great app. Adjustments needed. No equaliser and after you click on artists (in my music) albums should be next, not a list of all the songs the artist has."
12639,AmazonMusic,justin wells,4,0,works well. i have Bluetooth in my car and this app is much better then Pandora. i really like how it auto starts and stops when it connects to my car Bluetooth.
12640,AmazonMusic,Luke Blagg,4,0,i like it more than pandora. there has got to be a way to see what song played a few minutes ago when listening to a station? Also i wish it had a way of magically know what i want to listen to before i do- that would make my life a lot easier. werd
12641,AmazonMusic,Steven Rumbalski,2,0,Podcasts downloaded in another app show in my offline music. This hurts music browsing and kills my ability to shuffle all songs. There is no option to turn off Amazon Music looking at other apps' folders.
12642,AmazonMusic,Jesse Adams,5,0,Outstanding service! Huge selection of artists and songs and I love that many of them have the lyrics scrolling while the song is playing. Nice touch!
12643,AmazonMusic,Scott Russ,4,0,"it's a good service. better if you upgrade. I have no complaints. as a prime subscriber it did me well, but wanted more and bought the upgrade."
12644,AmazonMusic,Joshua Duncan,4,0,"Only has studio albums, no mixtapes. It's good for what it is, just don't hop on here expecting to find that mixtape you are wanting to listen to."
12645,AmazonMusic,Glenda Washington,1,0,Amazon Prime subscriber. App never works always states experiencing difficulties try again later. Have installed and uninstalled several times. Can't access music I have paid for.
12646,AmazonMusic,Allee Watkins,4,0,pretty good. I like it better than other option. The playlists repeat and seems like no new music is added to them. I just change playlists often.
12647,AmazonMusic,Debbie Regan,5,0,My favorite part of my Prime membership is the access to their video and music streaming services. Love that the music cd's that I purchase through Amazon are automatically added to my Amazon music account.
12648,AmazonMusic,Gary Giesen,3,3,"Buggy with Android Auto. It deauthorizes way too frequently, and can't reauthorize in Android Auto mode. Also frequently crashes in Android Auto mode."
12649,AmazonMusic,naveen panna,1,0,The app keeps on hanging. It will never constantly play any playlist. If in between i am using some other applications then automatically Amazon prime music crashes. Very dissappointed.
12650,AmazonMusic,Rachel Wirrig,4,0,Really nice service. The app is intuitive and easy to use. I held back one star because it doesn't always have the option for a specific station that I'm looking for.
12651,AmazonMusic,Jim Wiseman,2,0,Poor selection. Can be ok if looking for a particular item. Rubbish for random lists. Expensive if you have more than one devixe. Perfer spotify for selection
12652,AmazonMusic,Ragini Shukla,4,0,"the only thing missing is you cant sort out music by the artist. amazon please enable that feature seems quite basic, then i can give you 5 stars."
12653,AmazonMusic,Melissa Emery,5,0,"Works well, can be annoying when random songs get yanked from your free playlists and put up for payments. Overall, I would recommend this app."
12654,AmazonMusic,Quazi Smith,1,0,herky jerky .. plays when it wants to no matter if im on wifi or cellular network. thank goodness I got it free with a phone because I would NEVER pay for it!
12655,AmazonMusic,Dana Schnabel,2,0,Terrible. Freezes often. Awful GUI. Far too easy to accidentally scroll or start a new song when trying to build a playlist on the fly.
12656,AmazonMusic,Daniel Haynes,4,0,"Pretty alright. My only complaint is that a lot of the ""off the beaten path"" bands and albums require the subscription upgrade."
12657,AmazonMusic,rameez sheikh,2,0,"Every thing is good but, search a song play and silence, nothing is played next automatically. Have to open app again and search again or select another song. Please make sure app automatically generates a playlist of similar song that is searched and played so that we can listen music continuously."
12658,AmazonMusic,Erin Guevara,4,0,"The sound quality is good, there are quite a few songs available, but it is frustrating that you pay for the service (through your prime membership) and yet you can't use the music as you like. Once the membership is over, the music is no longer available. I can't listen to it on my mp3 player."
12659,AmazonMusic,BorisC,4,0,The operation of the app is excelent. however the management of it is not consistent. The content availability is not maintained.
12660,AmazonMusic,Cheri Morton,4,0,"I wish they would make a station just from the thumbs up instead of having it be under the ""top whatever genre"" but otherwise it's a good program."
12661,AmazonMusic,Ramjee Panayur,1,0,"doesnt let to manage play queue, or even allow basic functions like adding a playlist or album to the queue - managing playlist creates worst experience of all. messes the whole user experience."
12662,AmazonMusic,John,5,0,Loads of music. Ability to custom shuffle. No ads. Doesnt kill battery. What more could you ask for? I've uninstalled all my other music apps.

12666,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,After I joined Amazon Prime I was so focused on the huge amount of TV shows and the film series available I didn't notice Amazon music. Easy to use and easy to navigate around each page.
12667,AmazonMusic,Kai. A.,4,0,"I'm already a prime member and I still have to pay an additional 8 bucks to get access to all the music. To me, that's ridiculous. Other than that, I would've given this app 5 stars."
12668,AmazonMusic,Cassy Hall,3,0,"Amazon music does not utilize like or dislike response options, such as a thumbs-up or thumbs-down. I would prefer that to be an option in any of the windows."
12669,AmazonMusic,Jerry,5,0,This app is too good. There are so many choices and this makes it difficult as evidenced by all genres and playlists Albums and so on. I love this app.
12670,AmazonMusic,Larry Chan,3,0,Adding songs to your playlist doesn't always function. Have to add them several times sometimes to get them into my playlist. Kind of frustrating.

12678,AmazonMusic,Warren Leath,3,0,I like amazon better than pandora.I dont like the fact that they take your music and prevent you from listening to it after you've downloaded it.Been thinking of looking for some other provider because of that.

12680,AmazonMusic,Joseph Castor,4,0,like the app but im only giving 4 stars because I would like to have more settings for playlists such as how long my recently added stay in a recently added playlist and other smart playlist like samsung music has. also some songs stop working and you have to redownload them. and I wish you could make ringtones from the songs you download.

12683,AmazonMusic,Ar naveen Kumar,2,0,It's an nice app.. But missing feature like like and dislike..! So I can listen to the songs I liked in later stages..! Its difficult to add it to Playlist always
12684,AmazonMusic,Sagar Mhaisne,3,0,You should improve your search engine. It needs accurate keywords only. Related keywords search it doesn't take into consideration.. ðŸ˜£
12685,AmazonMusic,James Hooper,2,0,Not very easy to use or intuitive. Necessary to access prime music but way too much opportunity taken to upsell to unlimited. Amazon could and should do so much better.

12687,AmazonMusic,Sol Whiteley,3,0,"I use this app on the daily, however the fact that my music libary is becoming cluttered with deleted songs is seriously frustrating!

12698,AmazonMusic,Sue W,5,0,"way better than apple IMO. Amazon can be used anywhere with so many different devices. unless you have apple, you can use it."
12699,AmazonMusic,Vishal Kadakia,1,0,"Absolutely pathetic, every now and then a song i add to the playlist I've created goes greyed out. Not worth. Doesn't have good English music library"
12700,AmazonMusic,Uncle Robb,3,0,app works well. would give 5 stars if they stopped deleting good music. not sure why albums are not available after having them for a while.
12701,AmazonMusic,Tracy Chandler,4,0,I enjoy the playlists. But when trying to make my own playlist have difficulty finding the songs I want or did not realize that songs I have chosen were not free.
12702,AmazonMusic,joe perser,2,0,"downloaded, paid for music disappears from your playlist, never to return. Amazon is in total control of your music and deletes it without warning."
12703,AmazonMusic,Paula Horn,5,0,Great stations to listen to with a variety of genres. I have yet to explore the many different features this app offers. Amazon gets it right again!

12711,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,it is great to listen my music but I just wish they did so when you pay on a monthly basis you can load all you want instead of paying on a monthly basis and on top of that you also got to buy the songs or album I just wish you can also pay on a yearly basis as well
12712,AmazonMusic,Ma X,1,2,music catalogue sucks. im paying for Prime (which they keep raising the price of) i should get access to the Music Unlimited content

12715,AmazonMusic,Alex Haislip,2,2,"Constant download errors. Repeated playback errors, even with purchased music. Decent marketplace. Poor delivery."
12716,AmazonMusic,Callum Mitchell,3,0,Makes sense to use this instead of spotify/other as I am already paying monthly for amazon prime. It works but the app isn't overly amazing and I have experienced bugs with it from time to time.
12717,AmazonMusic,A Google user,2,0,"It's okay, pauses a lot and can be a bit unpredictable. it's also annoying paying for prime plus to listen to the newest music."

12720,AmazonMusic,Michelle Beard,4,0,"It's pretty great. Searches are a bit harder than on some other apps I've used. I love Amazon in general, I feel like I always get my money's worth."

12727,AmazonMusic,Mark Dorhout,1,1,"We had prime and were very limited so we updated to unlimited thinking it was ""unlimited"". Amazon still takes music away and now this morning over half of our music (including purchased) is gone. I can still access it on our pc but not the app."

12743,AmazonMusic,brian johnstone,5,0,It's a great app the only thing is that after a while anything you download for listening off becomes unavailable to listen to . So saying that how many people can listen to all 2 million songs?

12791,AmazonMusic,A Google user,3,0,The only thing that would make Amazon Music better is if they didn't repeat songs so often! I have 500 songs on my playlist but have yet to hear them all before the repeating starts.
12792,AmazonMusic,Robert Grendzinski,4,0,App works well on my older Android phone. It has most of the music I've searched for but once in a while a song might disappear probably due to licensing issues.
12793,AmazonMusic,Charlie Johnson,3,0,Its a very good app. But it shuffles song sometimes. Instead of playing the album in order. Other than that its a good app.

12801,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,"so much music available! but they remove music too, so sometimes you can't go back to listen to a song. But it's free(ish) so whatever."
12802,AmazonMusic,Randy Burkhardt,5,0,I've only used A.Music lately but I can say I'm very satisfied because I can get whatever my musicologist brain comes up with to check out slmist without exception. And it works smoothly these days.
12803,AmazonMusic,A Google user,2,0,"borderline unusable, when my phone is locked the app often won't continue to the next song, when I pause a song to switch to another app and return shortly it plays back from the beginning no matter where I left off, the menus even for downloaded songs frequently don't load properly until i restart the app.. all in all a bad experience"
12804,AmazonMusic,SANDIPAN DAWN,3,0,"somehow, i dont like the way the songs appear. There should be an option for autoplay similar type of songs. There are not much varaity in curated playlists also"
12805,AmazonMusic,rahul kashyap,4,0,"Loved this app, It gives me good songs when i need it most. Just have a small feedback if more songs can be added as in some cases i do not find old songs."
12806,AmazonMusic,Kathleen Contreras,3,0,"I have found majority of the songs but I have come across searching for a song and it's no available. other than that, I've had no issues. it's been great!"
12807,AmazonMusic,Lauren Wood,4,0,"Great song selection and intuitive suggestions, easy to turn on and use online and offline features. Searches and streaming are slower at times than similar platforms."
12808,AmazonMusic,Costantina Fye,4,0,"It has almost every song I have looked for. The only problem is some songs will no longer be available, and lately the app has been freezing up."
12809,AmazonMusic,Hannah Book,5,0,I'm really enjoying this music app! I can skip as many songs as I want without it telling me to change the channel! I can make Playlist too!
12810,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,I love my amazon music app... love the variety of stations.... music can be so uplifting and inspiring... makes my day to have so many options with the amazon music app!!
12811,AmazonMusic,Libby Sellers,5,0,I listen to mainly contemporary Christian music and so far every song I've looked up they've had. I really like that I can ask the Alexa devices to play a song and it will do it.
12812,AmazonMusic,Richard Thompson,5,0,I really love Amazon Music Prime. it is hard to request a song that is not available. Playlists are awesome. Search works really well.
12813,AmazonMusic,Brandon Glickley,5,0,Offline listening (NO DATA USEAGE) great for listening to music at work. Has a great shuffle of music on related artists to the one you originally chose. Better than pandora or Spotify!
12814,AmazonMusic,R.J C.,4,0,"It's great, nearly exactly like having my specific music playlist with me! Would give it 5 stars if it didn't keep trying to sell me something when logging in."
12815,AmazonMusic,Jacob Henry,4,0,No Commercials! Great choice of music with prime only. Sometimes when you list to the same station the sequence of songs is the same and not random.
12816,AmazonMusic,Anthony Richer,2,1,"Since the last update it's been crashing or taking forever to load. Prior to this, the app was great."
12817,AmazonMusic,frances burton,4,0,"good selections of music, better choices if you subscribe to unlimited, which I don't like because I'm paying already for music... ðŸ˜•"
12818,AmazonMusic,Blaike Marini,5,0,I love this service and app. Has all the music i want and need and the features are much easier to navigate than spotify or pandora and easy to replay or play certain songs you want.
12819,AmazonMusic,Monuaye Deah,5,0,Love everything about the app. Has majority of the music I love. Would love there to be more selections from 90s and before.
12820,AmazonMusic,A Google user,3,0,"was loving but now not, earlier in older version from notifications pane we would be able to have control accessible now it is not working you to open and change songs, also songs that are downloaded not working without connection"
12821,AmazonMusic,Sebastian Cunningham,4,0,"why does it keeps skipping, as if it's scratch? this is the only problem i keep having.other then that, im a prime member"" how do i share my family member ship?"
12822,AmazonMusic,Kim Werling,4,0,"I love Amazon music! So many choices, I can store my music and many different options with playlists; either my own or suggested ones."
12823,AmazonMusic,Brian Walsh,2,0,"terrible with Android auto! mostly good otherwise. Everytime it starts it goes back to the same song... so annoying, then i have to reselect a playlist again."
12824,AmazonMusic,Chad Colwell,5,0,I have tried most ofthe other music services and always come back to this one. I love it! Unlimited is well woth the money!
12825,AmazonMusic,Sagar Dani,4,0,Plz add equalizer. We would not like to see music files on the phone in 'My music'. So pls add option to show/hide music files on device.
12826,AmazonMusic,Andy Goodey,5,0,Have been using Amazon Music for a few years and love it. As my family grow they use it all too. i always recommend Amazon music and prime .
12827,AmazonMusic,Bob H,5,0,"Connected to two linked Amazon Echos, the sound is exceptional. Easy to select your required music, coupled with an unbelievable choice. Top marks."
12828,AmazonMusic,Tony Barbour,3,0,"Lots of music, but some albums are strangely absent. Also, every time I go to listen to an album a second time, the songs are all in the wrong order."
12829,AmazonMusic,Joe Whitehair,3,0,Good but not great. Ad on load causes the app to hang if you don't have a connection. Music organization could be better.
12830,AmazonMusic,Richard Foxwell,5,0,"Great music selection. search by genre, song title, album title or artist. Especially good if you subscribe to prime."
12831,AmazonMusic,Jagadeesha GS,5,0,It is a very good app for music. You get songs of all languages. One of the most important thing is that it does not have buffering. Over all it is nice
12832,AmazonMusic,Suraj Bhandari,5,0,"Usually, I download songs from web. But after using this, I formatted my drive. So, this is what it feels like to use something legally."
12833,AmazonMusic,Carl Claypoole,5,0,"Best paid music app in the business in my opinion, Amazon Music Unlimited is hands down the easiest and most user-friendly music service."
12834,AmazonMusic,Kobelt k,5,0,"This app is amazing, you can play any music you want and even buy some, with amazon music unlimited no ads ,and turn off your phone and keep listening like pandora, fav music appðŸ˜ðŸ˜"
12835,AmazonMusic,Kyle P,2,0,"When hooked up to bluetooth, it skips and stutters unless I keep the screen unlocked on my phone. Dont have this problem with any other music app."
12836,AmazonMusic,Tim Hogue,4,0,easy to use has all the music I look for. would give 5 stars if the songs I downloaded would go to my SD card. but other than that great app.
12837,AmazonMusic,Shannon Kight,5,0,"It's been working pretty well for me. It's easy to search for artists, and make playlists, though I usually just hit shuffle on my cloud service."
12838,AmazonMusic,Angi Payne,2,0,"I used to love amazon music, and now, a lot of my playlists randomly delete songs, and I can't play the ones that are still on there."
12839,AmazonMusic,Lucas Toddy,1,0,"Despite having an Unlimited Account I cannot apparently play or utilize this app at all. It acknowledges I have Unlimited, says it is redirecting and nothing changes or happens. WTH."
12840,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,I love this app. I'm not super techy and it is very easy. There have been very few songs or albums I have looked for and NOT been available.
12841,AmazonMusic,Arnie Laubach,5,0,"It's like having all the albums you ever wanted . . . wait, it is! You can que up practically anything you want to listen to. Great to have."
12842,AmazonMusic,Lucas LaGesse,4,0,Huge catalog and easy to use. Play lists by Amazon could use more attention by a curator to keep them fresh. Otherwise it is a great app.
12843,AmazonMusic,Michael McRae,3,0,used to love it but have had lots of problems recently and I'm very upset about not being able to upload my music anymore. my playlists are not consistently loaded on my various devices anymore
12844,AmazonMusic,Chuck Jones,3,0,"good app. wish it would let me play other music on phone that i upload. android auto will only play Amazon app, difficult to access music i upload. love the stations on Amazon app, please do more"
12845,AmazonMusic,Ashwin Venkatraman,1,0,"all of a sudden today, all my downloads on prime music and prime videos got wiped out. only your software had this problem. I cannot trust this app."
12846,AmazonMusic,Jason Ramella,5,0,"like that the service comes with prime. Unlimited is worth it for a larger selection that is close, but out of your comfort zone in taste."
12847,AmazonMusic,Natalya Moroz,5,0,This is my favourite app for music. I can download the music and don't have to worry about wasting my data. They have everything in the marketplace. It's so easy to use.
12848,AmazonMusic,aditya phule,2,0,Many of the songs are missing. Even when downloaded the song buffers. Many of the artists aren't added with full Playlist.
12849,AmazonMusic,Andrew R,3,0,"easy to use and create lists, convenient if a prime member, limited choices even tho a member, always an upsell for the music you want which is frustrating."
12850,AmazonMusic,Anthony Boze,5,0,"Makes my long trips bearable without changing stations, because the one I was listening to is out of range, and no commercials."
12851,AmazonMusic,Rob Conahan,5,0,"Excellent. Can pull up and listen to just about anything. All the latest music. downloading not all, but most. Price is right."
12852,AmazonMusic,Thomas Reilly,1,0,very poor app I've used most streaming apps and this is worst. user friendlyness is very bad. songs constantly stopping and only playing again after opening phone again. time to go back to spotify.
12853,AmazonMusic,Todd Discher,2,1,I dont want your stupid Amazon Unlimited. There are songs I would like to have without being a part of your sales gimmick.
12854,AmazonMusic,A Google user,1,1,Really awful app as a subscriber. Nothing works. Very 2007. A focus group would crush this nonsense.
12855,AmazonMusic,Tim Marchant,4,0,"Good overall, easy to use and to organise . Gripes are so much of the music is covers, and iffy ones at that. As an app, it works fine though"
12856,AmazonMusic,HipkeBros,5,0,It is so nice having all the music i am looking for at anytime. i enjoy having music to listen offline out in the field. keep it coming.
12857,AmazonMusic,Michael Kozuch,3,1,"Amazon Music seems to be going downhill. I've been listening to Amazon Music for years now, but recently the app seems to hang much more frequently (on multiple devices), beg for ratings incessantly, and retire music from the library more often."
12858,AmazonMusic,Blake Stonebreaker,5,0,it's great...only thing is not happy that I had to start paying more for unlimited when I have been a prime member for 5 plus year's and only keep my prime membership for the music and video service....
12859,AmazonMusic,Dwight Larson,4,0,"Amazon Music is a pretty good app. Sometimes I feel the controls/menus are a little obtuse, but I can always work it out and get what I need."
12860,AmazonMusic,Kyle Pelletier,3,1,"it's nice to have access to free music from Amazon prime, but it skips way to often even when you have the songs downloaded."
12861,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,So far I have enjoyed Amazon Music. I love playing some of my old favorites. it's great having the huge number of radio stations available also.
12862,AmazonMusic,DevinRULZ81 YT,5,0,Amazon music is far better than any other music company. besides the couple songs that get deleted but it's a great way to hear music!!
12863,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,like pandora but the ability to find exactly what you want and having the ability to download your own playlist. NO COMMERCIALS! Also a plus.
12864,AmazonMusic,Mayank Ashok,2,0,"The hangs a lot... not able to change the song from the drop down widget. Very irritating, have to actually switch to the app to change the song aur to pause it!"
12865,AmazonMusic,Michelle B.,3,3,I would have given Amazon five stars but lately the songs keep buffering even when I have good internet connection. Please fix! I want to love and give five stars to this app!
12866,AmazonMusic,raj kumar,4,0,Downloaded songs are taking device space. it could have been stored in cloud for offline viewing. Diversity is not very much like wynk music app.
12867,AmazonMusic,Kitt Rothstein,4,0,"handy but difficult to add/ delete songs to downloaded playlists. also, confusing as to what music you're collecting where(online vs offline, playlist vs recently downloaded, etc)"
12868,AmazonMusic,BORN KING,5,0,dopest music app I've ever used! tons of music and genres to choose from.. commercial free and I can skip forward or go back with no problems..
12869,AmazonMusic,Alexis Fairbanks,4,0,"love the fact that there are no ads! makes it the best just for that. Also has wide variety of genres, old, and new hits."
12870,AmazonMusic,David Salguero,5,0,I love Amazon music had the rest of them now I have the best one no ads I love it and if you have the free version it's only a few ads so in my opinion it's the best music site on the market
12871,AmazonMusic,Michael Cramer,2,1,how can you be the biggest corporation on the planet but all of your apps are garbage? horrible to navigate and so many errors
12872,AmazonMusic,Leonard Lucia,5,0,"great app & service. have everything I look for, always works, I can download or play from online. everything I could ask for!"
12873,AmazonMusic,Ricca Escamilla,5,0,Excellent song choices and great personalized ways to organize and listen to your favorite music. I highly recommend!!
12874,AmazonMusic,saravanan j,5,0,cool . with a nice quality audio. amazon should allow users to download in and play from the users device . not just on prime.
12875,AmazonMusic,Robert MacPhail,1,0,This used to be great but now it is unstable as hell. I have given up trying to get amazon to address the multitude of isdues and am no longer buying music from this store!
12876,AmazonMusic,A Google user,2,1,"App keeps freezing. Sorting is completely random for classical music. could be by conductor, orchestra or composer."
12877,AmazonMusic,Justin Shank,5,0,"Great app, easy to use, and a huge selection of music. I even found some pretty obscure local music from around 2001 on there. Love it!"
12878,AmazonMusic,shreyash dutt,4,0,The app is good...but i have a suggestion. can you add song speed option so we can increase or decrease song speed for slow songs and sometimes understand fast raps !!!
12879,AmazonMusic,Asher Simon,5,0,"If there are no ADs then it already awesome. A dark & intense UI and love the Alexa integration. Highly recommended, especially if you're a prime member."
12880,AmazonMusic,Murali Kumar,4,0,"its good music app. but telugu albums are limited, its more focused on tamil, hindi and english. As a telugu music lover if amazon provide more on telugu music it will be 5 star rating. but thumbsup."
12881,AmazonMusic,Allan Siguenza,3,0,It is constantly crashing and disconnecting from the Bluetooth devices. It's also annoying that every time that I play a song from my library it makes a weird sound throughout the songs
12882,AmazonMusic,Austin Dutcher,5,0,"There is an obviously vast variety of music to be downloaded, and at ten dollars a month, it rivals the music services of even Google."
12883,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,2,"Amazing. Very smooth, easy to make playlists, user friendly, and there are infinite skips!"
12884,AmazonMusic,jonathan smail,1,0,"this app is horrible, says it's downloaded and can't play music. good time Amazon keeps buying and current products are mediocre at best."
12885,AmazonMusic,Terry Donini,4,0,great selection of music!!! learning how to use Alexa to help select music. we don't miss a beat together!!!!!
12886,AmazonMusic,Jennifer Delci,5,0,endless amount if music. one or two words in the search and presto the song/artist/album pops up. its the only music streaming service/app i use.
12887,AmazonMusic,Leonard Hall,5,0,I couldn't be more pleased! This App works extremely well! I especially enjoy the off line function? Great App!?
12888,AmazonMusic,James Palmer,5,0,love this app. easy to use and great selection of music. play lists learn what you like and select just the right tunes.
12889,AmazonMusic,Salvador E Afane,1,1,the advertisement of the Amazon paid music is extremely annoying. I give one star because i have other music apps and are not constantly telling me to buy
12890,AmazonMusic,Shi A,1,0,App freezes often or skips while streaming music. Also tried adding songs to playlists but it doesn't do it 80%of the time. Not user friendly either.
12891,AmazonMusic,Michele Ryan,5,0,Playing my playlist and others make my day. Being able to purchase the music I want in any form then adding it to my lists. thank you.
12892,AmazonMusic,Mark Fica,4,0,"Pretty good app. I'd like to see better integration with Android Auto so that I could use voice control 100%. Other than that, I have no complaints."
12893,AmazonMusic,V. Kristophe Hawkins,5,0,luv Amazon music. The variety is music is out of this world & the ease to find what you're looking for is fantastic. Highly recommend...
12894,AmazonMusic,CSRK AGStudios,5,1,Easy to use quick to install. Soooooo many free songs by all different artists. Love this app.
12895,AmazonMusic,Mike,1,0,"logged out of the amazon shopping app which logged me out of amazon music as well (which lets face it, this app is pretty garbage) which then removed the thousands of songs I had downloaded ðŸ™‚"
12896,AmazonMusic,Eric Ungerman,1,0,"I downloaded Amazon Music and searched for 1 song, ""Beautiful."" I must pay $7.99 to listen to this song? Can you say uninstall?"
12897,AmazonMusic,Sagar Deshpande,4,0,4 stars because of some minor bugs in search functionality - when u search with internet off. also the collection is not extensive. lot better than competition though!
12898,AmazonMusic,Marshall Clowers,5,0,"Really easy to use, I do wish I could use voice search as it's a bit clumsy to use while driving (until I remembered to use Alexa)."
12899,AmazonMusic,Mithra Arambula,3,4,"Anything offline is to unstable. Loved being able to download my music and play offline, but there's been way too many problems. 1.Some tracks get cut off into a weird loop. Not even when you download, sometimes just start acting like that then you have to redownload. 2.Music i have PURCHASED diaappears from my downloads altogetger. 3.Music stops working and app prompts me to refresh songs, but nothing happens, so probably have to reinstall. 4. Has corrupted my sd multiple timeswhile downloadin"
12900,AmazonMusic,ankita bangabash,3,0,needs to have a wider collection and better search features.If you don't type the name of the song exactly as it is named in the app...you don't get a search result.could be better.
12901,AmazonMusic,Greg Clarke,2,0,"Already paying for this, only to find a hefty portion of stuff i wanna listen to is available only if i pay even more money. Nice one."
12902,AmazonMusic,Trishul Parmar,4,0,"There sure a room for improvement in terms of their collection... It lacks a lot of good titles like Saathiya, recent Punjabi hits and more to name a few..."
12903,AmazonMusic,Alan Jorgensen,5,0,"All the music I've purchased on CDs is available here. A definite wear and tear saver. I use it all the time, especially when learning how to play a song."
12904,AmazonMusic,Torie Torreano,5,0,Love it! Any song any time! Put together your own playlists or listen to ones in genres or even in the similar veins of specific artists. 100% Score!
12905,AmazonMusic,Dharti Trivedi,3,0,somewhat easy to use. sometimes songs aren't available. not easy to switch between purchased and downloaded music and streamed music.
12906,AmazonMusic,Ron Mitchell,5,0,"This app is probably the one I use the most. Since getting unlimited, I'm like a kid in a toy store on a sugar high. Do they even have toy stores anymore?"
12907,AmazonMusic,A Google user,3,1,"okay selection of the music I like, but songs and artists disappear all the time. Any playlists are only available as long as you maintain your prime account! Worse, they don't allow copying or download to my other devices and playlist! That really SUCKS"
12908,AmazonMusic,Ria Kinsley,3,0,The app is a bit slow opening and not as intuitive as spotify. Plus keeps asking over and over if I wanna sign up for unlimited music which is very annoying.
12909,AmazonMusic,Tara Nicolette,3,0,"it's ok. used to be better. now it glitches like a champ. wont play certain songs or channels. getting pretty disappointed with it and if it doesn't get a face lift soon I'll probably switch, which is a shame. used to like it a lot."
12910,AmazonMusic,Charity McClain,5,0,"I love the variety and the fact that I can make my own play list, so it 8s what I like. i wish that I could add my own music again."
12911,AmazonMusic,Alex Kephart-geist,5,0,Easy and free with my prime membership. You can still upgrade but im happy with the way it is now. Plays in background.
12912,AmazonMusic,Sean Cribbins,3,1,Confusing UI. Baiting and switching Prime users into Amazon Music Unlimited. Even before that - poor bitrate and sound quality.
12913,AmazonMusic,Michael Moody,5,0,"I listen to Amazon music all the time. great variety of music. love the classic rock, jazz Fusion and blues stations."
12914,AmazonMusic,Charles Davidson,4,0,"Good music selection, okay player. It would be nice if the app had tone and other basic data stream processing capabilities."
12915,AmazonMusic,A Google user,4,2,Great app but a little hard to search and Unlimited should come free with Prime. like that you can see the song words when listening to the song. Without paying for Unlimited Music you miss out on a lotnof music.
12916,AmazonMusic,Aaron Heim,4,0,"I use it almost a few times during the week! The only poopy part Amazon removes more and more ""free"" tunes that I have already downloaded."
12917,AmazonMusic,Raymundo Colburn,5,0,"Great music and excellent sound quality. One thing though, I wish more albums had digital booklets. Aside from that, great app."
12918,AmazonMusic,Paul Whitelock,1,0,"It is incredibly difficult to get the app to do what you want, and often the way you do something in one place is totally different in another. A miserable experience."
12919,AmazonMusic,Ann Clarke,5,0,"Amazon music has such a wide choice for all types, l just ask Alexa to play music and she plays a varity for me or l can ask for spacific era's. l can find songs l havn't heard for years. would totally reccommend."
12920,AmazonMusic,Paloma Ortiz,5,0,"great app, pretty simple to use, i like the unlimited cause it's definitely worth the price. radio is pretty much always spot on."
12921,AmazonMusic,Larry Mundt,1,0,they used to offer unlimited access to music. Now due to Greed. its limited unless you pay over and above their annual fee. such a shame
12922,AmazonMusic,Rob Newman,1,0,"the app is ok, just be aware that Amazon will charge you twice in a month and call you an idiot even when you send them your bank account records to prove that they charged you twice"
12923,AmazonMusic,Jarred Goodhue,3,3,"I've always had a good experience with this app until it's last update. now its crashing , stopping music and has bad quality. please fix it"
12924,AmazonMusic,Andrew Reed,1,2,always cuts out after about 5 minutes and screen goes black. once you restart it work fine next day the cycle repeats. i wilpbe cancelling
12925,AmazonMusic,Anuj Kumar,1,1,"the app has limited the no. of songs to 175 that can be added to Amazon music, and removed songs from playlist without acknowledging me."
12926,AmazonMusic,Cayla Dillard,4,0,"love how can find any preffered song. dislike that some of the songs in my play music become unplayed or deleted. if the song was available when saved, why no longer?"
12927,AmazonMusic,Ira Sullivan,5,0,I thoroughly enjoy using this app. I pretty much use it most of the time. At work I'm in my own little world listening to my personalized playlists.
12928,AmazonMusic,A Google user,2,0,need to update playlist with discontinued music. I would listen to country top 50 playlist and there wouldl be a whole lot of pauses for songs discontinued and would have to manually click next song while driving.
12929,AmazonMusic,Vance Robinson,3,0,"its pretty cool but it never resumes to the previous song, station or playlist i was listening to the last time i had the app open...this would be a really good feature wortg 5 stars"
12930,AmazonMusic,christina marie,5,0,This is my favorite app for music! I am able to use this app all the time with low battery use! i am so happy with it!!
12931,AmazonMusic,Patrick Blakely,4,0,really great way to listen to the music I like. would have given five stars but their song selections by individual artists is lacking in my opinion.
12932,AmazonMusic,Tim Dunbar,2,0,it constantly will stop access to a song wether I downloaded it not. what's the point of paying for a service I already pay for???
12933,AmazonMusic,Jamison Shaffer,3,0,"It's alright. Gets the job done, but not a curated experience at all. Other music options have a more premium feel for the price point."
12934,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,Has music even Apple doesn't offer. Deep cuts and artists beyond the scope of your top 100. This app is for serious music enthusiasts.
12935,AmazonMusic,Gordon Plant,4,1,all the music I Love and enjoy. Here at the ALF I live in they call me the music man cause I always have music playing.
12936,AmazonMusic,Molly Bailey,5,0,Awesome service! This has every song I have ever looked for. This is and will continue to be my only source for music! I highly recommend!
12937,AmazonMusic,David Smith,5,0,"Amazing selection of music and the app seems rock solid, been a subscriber for years and cannot see that changing. Well done Amazon!"
12938,AmazonMusic,Tony Leonard,2,0,"This app is not in the least bit user-friendly... It is complicated to use, and unintuitive... The only reason I give it two stars is because I like the music selection.... But the app itself is garbage. Oh, and this is for the paid version"
12939,AmazonMusic,Rob Slonecker,5,0,"App is not bad, a lot of times it doesn't play the genre of music that you want. It also loses memory on songs that you save to playlist."
12940,AmazonMusic,Diane Fagan,4,0,"love this app.. music anywhere, anytime. No adverts inbetween songs but only drawback is i now have adverts on my mob which im assuming is conected to amazon music . otherwise would of been 5 stars ."
12941,AmazonMusic,Andrew Derouin,2,1,Constantly removes downloaded playlists. App is not user friendly and hard to navigate. Spotify was much better.
12942,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,"great app, plays almost everything I want to listen to. also give great ideas for music you might like based upon your searches and repertoire."
12943,AmazonMusic,Paula Cayless,5,0,Great app. I have my music wherever I go - great in the car. Simple to use and whatever I buy on Amazon automatically rips to my app.
12944,AmazonMusic,Amy-Beth Olver,3,0,The app is easy to navigate and music selection is ok. Amazon are very good at penalizing their prime customers with lack of content so that customers opt for their unlimited service instead.
12945,AmazonMusic,Danyelle Sherwood,5,0,I use this all the time in my truck via blue tooth! Great to play whatever songs I want and hands free with Alexa! Unlimited data is a must though!
12946,AmazonMusic,Soaham Gundawar,1,0,"Many songs are not available. The playlists of top songs are not updated, so one has to keep listening to the old songs repeatedly."
12947,AmazonMusic,mar s,4,0,"just a few minor things, widget for android never worked for me and playing a song, will pay the first one but stillhave to ask for the other songs."
12948,AmazonMusic,Vincent Goins,5,0,"I really love the diverse music selections available!. Great ease in purchasing new music. Great sounding, nice features & easy to use."
12949,AmazonMusic,Stuart Norman,5,0,love this app/service. we have an Alexa at home and its great to be able to add to our playlists whilst we're on the go and listen to whatever we want anytime anywhere.
12950,AmazonMusic,susan cowie,4,3,Not sure what the rating is for. If its amazon music then i gave it 4 stars. Have noticed that more and more of my tracks are disappointing from my playlist as they are seemingly no longer available . This was the reason i switched from apple music.
12951,AmazonMusic,Rich Gruttola,1,0,constantly asking to upgrade even though you already pay is annoying. when you have a music playlist sometimes you can't even select the songs on there. I'm canceling this and switching to spotify
12952,AmazonMusic,Jennifer Janvrin,5,2,love this app!!! Priced very nicely and has so much music and I love the playlists.
12953,AmazonMusic,Alan Sandham,5,0,"Whatever's available I can listen to ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘brilliant, make my own playlists and share them with my family. Can't live without this, Alan thanks Amazon ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤©ðŸŽ¶"
12954,AmazonMusic,Chris H,4,0,"Some songs on my playlist become permanently unavailable, that's disappointing. Other than that, the app works well."
12955,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,just love it. so much music and totally worth every penny if you are a music fiend like me. Cant fault it to be honest. ðŸ˜Š
12956,AmazonMusic,A Google user,3,0,the application crashes continuously and requures deleting and reinstalling. access to music is fine. not really happy with it overall.
12957,AmazonMusic,Garrett Robbins,5,1,"Any song I could want to hear, no matter how obscure that song may be, it can be found. I love it."
12958,AmazonMusic,Clare Wroblewski,5,0,Love it! The selection is great and it is very user friendly! I listen to it all day at work and often at home. I no longer use Spotify or Pandora.
12959,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,there's no way im going to delete this app. love my music so much this the only place i can find all the music i need! thanx u bunch!ðŸ˜ƒ
12960,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,very very Kool app I get the music I like when I want it and it is at a good price. I will not go back to any of the others again. I also like when I get Alerts on when a Band I'm following has a New release.
12961,AmazonMusic,Robert Tripp,5,0,Make the most of your Prime subscription and install this on your phone. Take your tunes with you... download them for those gloriously unconnected times.
12962,AmazonMusic,Richard Walker,4,0,"really like this app. could probably do with broadening the music library if it's to compete with Spotify, but that could be my weird music taste!"
12963,AmazonMusic,Sarah Hudrick,5,0,one thing I would like to see change is when I play an artists playlist it will play them all not just 30 songs. otherwise well wprth the money!!!
12964,AmazonMusic,Devin Danielson,4,0,My only complaint is not being able to transfer my own music from my memory card to my online library. I have to go through one by one and find my songs online and add them
12965,AmazonMusic,Kelly Pilant,5,0,"I like that I can get the digital down load and the CD, I can take my music anywhere even on my hunting land where there is nothing around especially a cell phone signal."
12966,AmazonMusic,Regina Trujillo,5,0,I love adding older songs and current to my playlists. I play various playlists according to my mood and activity. you have a great selection.
12967,AmazonMusic,Manuel Contreras,5,0,oh hell they message me with new music and most of the time i love it. its cheap and my family loves listening to it on our Alexa and i listen to it on my way to work.
12968,AmazonMusic,Ryan Daly,2,0,"slower than it should be, doesn't download purchased songs seamlessly and i was supposed to get intro rate, but being charged for the full price..."
12969,AmazonMusic,Stephanie Larkins,5,0,I love this app. I have Amazon music unlimited and I can get brand new music and make my own playlists for the car. It is perfect!
12970,AmazonMusic,Shane Miles,4,0,"Good, but not great. Default random playback is just that... Default and therefore repetitive. It needs to have several differing randomised options."
12971,AmazonMusic,Cae Dron,5,0,"Tried it with my prime, immediately cancelled my premium Pandora that we had for years. Just as good and included with all the other benefits we enjoy."
12972,AmazonMusic,Zlatin Stoilov,1,0,"That App will cause you a nervÐµ breakdown. Slow, non responsive, utterly useless. Sometimes when crash you must restart the phone to make the App to start again."
12973,AmazonMusic,A Google user,1,4,"Worthless. I thought since I have Amazon Prime, this app was included. Not the case. Every song I searched for would come up but could only play if I paid for Amazon Prime Unlimited."
12974,AmazonMusic,Heather Norris,4,0,Good music app. Even has genres others don't. Has a tendency to take a little longer then expected to load when not in wifi but overall I'd recommend this app before any others
12975,AmazonMusic,Beth Puschautz,5,0,5 (+) I LOVE Amazon & the Music App Rocks !!! When i hear that someone has Amazon Prime & does not use the App! I am like what???
12976,AmazonMusic,Jamie Novakowski,5,0,Love it! I have any music available at any time or mood! I like jazz when I'm cooking dinner to pop when I'm cleaning!
12977,AmazonMusic,A Google user,4,0,I am finding out that some of my songs on my play list are no longer available on Amazon music so it took a lot of time to create my play lists and I am disappointed that some songs are no longer on my list
12978,AmazonMusic,Sean Beesley,2,0,Okay except won't let you upload music purchased from other sources anymore (only Amazon). Also has habit of jumping to next track before prev one has finished.
12979,AmazonMusic,J Jackie,1,0,I can't find my playlist I created. I can add to the playlist but can't locate and listen to it. I'm disappointed with this app!
12980,AmazonMusic,Rob Staveley,4,0,"Not bad, but seems to pick up wrong songs in albums and you get a lot of duplicates. Lacks the polish of competitors."
12981,AmazonMusic,Aaron Omlor,5,0,The prices for the albums are comperable with other music aps. The app is easy to use and have had not streaming issues. Allaround great app.
12982,AmazonMusic,Manny Arambula,3,0,"I already pay for the service as part of my Prime membership, yet the app asks constantly to upgrade to premium. Also sometimes the streaming will buffer off and on off and on"
12983,AmazonMusic,LaVerne Brown,3,0,"It is sometimes frustrating, because it will not play music from previous purchases from my computer that were from itunes that were not in the cloud."
12984,AmazonMusic,Cindy Jonas,5,0,"great music bank, I use the prime included Amazon music as I think paying extra when you already pay for prime is very exaggerated. but this has a good music bank and love it."
12985,AmazonMusic,simon ingleson,5,0,"Fantastic app, all the music you need for any occasion, streams perfect on all Amazon devices, highly recommended. keep up the good work Amazon."
12986,AmazonMusic,Joshua Cohen,4,0,very good app. sometimes slow to load but generally works very well. I like the ease of use. and you can play by genre which is nice.
12987,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,"Great music app. Love the fact you can download songs, entire albums, or your own playlists to listen to offline."
12988,AmazonMusic,Beau Leblanc,3,0,the app stand alone is great. but when using android auto it will not find requested songs. and only wants to play the same play list over and over.
12989,AmazonMusic,Heather Smith,5,0,Great app for all different genres of music! I have the unlimited version and it is very much worth it!! I have access to all the music I love!
12990,AmazonMusic,Christian Obrien,5,0,excellent selection but I am do not like that the full library was put behind a subscription. It used to all be free when my family signed up for Amizon Prime. I would rate this app 9/10
12991,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,0,"amazon music gets me the variety I need, and they are current. I also like finding stuff I like on my own, that's the differance."
12992,AmazonMusic,Tamra D,5,0,"Great selection of music to stream! The capability to organize free music into playlists is also an important feature, I highly recommend Amazon Music!"
12993,AmazonMusic,Sandra Berger,5,0,"I love this app. can play any music anytime. if you love certain songs then purchase them, or you can do prime then it's free."
12994,AmazonMusic,Karen Walker,4,0,"music subscription use to include all music, now have to buy monthly premium unlimited to get all music. but streaming quality is awesome and has never failed me."
12995,AmazonMusic,Jairo A,5,0,Almost every song I look for is there. Even YouTube parody stars like the Key of Awesome. Amazon Music with Prime Music Unlimited is a perfect pairing.
12996,AmazonMusic,Austin T,1,1,music will randomly stop playing when the screen is off for a few minutes. I have to open the app to get it to restart
12997,AmazonMusic,James Eisenhut,4,1,only 2 things I don't care for are the limit of 500 songs and too much repeating of songs forcing me to advance if I want to hear more off my playlist
12998,AmazonMusic,Tara G,1,0,Certain songs just have problems with playback (maybe 3 out of 5 times) and then the whole thing freezes up. When that happens it takes forever to do anything. I really want to love the app. I'm so suprised this is still a problem.
12999,AmazonMusic,Molly Traylor,5,0,Love Love Love my Amazon Music Unlimited -- it's so worth it. Every song you could ever want is right at your fingertips.
13000,AmazonMusic,Donald Honeywill,5,0,Easy to use and has a vast library to select what ever happens to tickles your fancy. ..Bottom line .... I am impressed.
13001,AmazonMusic,Joe Powers,1,15,"I'm a prime member for years, so I expect this app to at least be average since it's touted as one of the membership benefits.  But it's poor.  How poor?  Well when I stream a station like I would on Pandora, it errors out on numerous songs included in the station.  So you have to stop what you are doing, skip that song, and hit play again to continue.  It's a jarring discontinuity.  Forget using it as background music at your party.  Like right now ANY Ed Sheeran song kills the stream.  Even worse, there is a button to report the problem.  If you fill that all out and hit send, after a few days you get an undeliverable message back on the email account you used to file to bug report that the recipient isn't valid (and it's auto filled in mind you).  So not only doesn't Amazon care that the app doesn't work, they also don't even care enough to make sure that they can receive your complaint so they can pretend they are looking at bugs.  And it's been this way for months.  I never write app reviews, but this one has ticked me off enough, for a service I'M PAYING FOR, that it really deserves to just be viciously roasted.  Thanks for listening."
13002,AmazonMusic,MAZH WB,4,4,"I can't find some last hits easy.Iwould like to avoid some rap, trap, regeton... of the hits list. I don't like when you guys or computer servers, mix bachata and vallenatos in the same list, ""like Latin music"" that's it. For instance i don't like bachata, regeton. But i like salsa, vallenatos, regue, soka and Rock in Spanish. I don't know if you see the difference but for us the difference is huge. Latin music have a lot of differents generous. I love so much the lyrics on my music.Thx a lot."
13003,AmazonMusic,Sara Asfaw,1,8,"This app has been working great until recently. it started to stop playing in the middle of a song every 5 minutes or so. The way to get it to resume is to open the app again and again...sooo annoying. If you're driving, forget about it. Some albums become unavailable all of a sudden. Amazon needs to fix this."
13004,AmazonMusic,Richard Boer,5,62,"First time using the app was on a road trip. Not sure why I hadn't used it sooner. I just set the station like a radio station, and connect it to the cars Bluetooth. Using the buttons on the steering wheel to replay songs I like and skipping forward past the ones I didn't. No breaks in play, even through Kansas, so assume there's some buffering for when you don't have internet."
13005,AmazonMusic,Michael C.,3,23,"Its tough to build the playlist I want. The interface is unintuitive and builing the playlist I want is a chore. I cant save my playlist across phones unless it only contains music bought from Amazon, meaning that if I have a playlist with music saved on my sd card, that playlist is erased when I switch my phone even though I still have the card. And stop pushing prime music on me. I already have prime!"
13006,AmazonMusic,Larry Warren,3,47,"one concurrent use not fair...especially since prime increase this year...one is just cheap. Should be 2 concurrent with prime, 4 with unlimited. Update 4/19...lot of pauses, stops etc when chromecast audio casting...maybe even if playing on phone (android)... other cast apps play fine so this app, not google...please fix!"
13007,AmazonMusic,Annie Brown,5,231,"love this app..... i had to delete it two days ago to fix a problem and once i downloaded it back my music was still there and my name was at the top, welcoming me back..... so so so loving this...... amazon you rock Thank you so very much..... from a music lover"
13008,AmazonMusic,Demonic Dave,1,101,"annoying constant requests to join per month when I just want my own music. It has now started to a peach and stops streaming offline music when it feels like it, so you get to click the screen on for it to continue to play."
13009,AmazonMusic,A Google user,4,5,"Good, but needs more user friendly features. Look at what Groove was capable of before Microsoft shut it down and try to be more like that."
13010,AmazonMusic,Nikhil Chandra C,3,4,Quality is awsome. Only famous songs are available. Some albums are not available. Improve your listing and search algorithms. Not finding targetted song even though it is there on your servers.
13011,AmazonMusic,Adriana Beal,2,29,"I find the interface confusing at times, and hard to create playlists with the offline/online options. Also, I feel like the app keeps trying to make me listen to music I don't like."
13012,AmazonMusic,Marty Falasco,4,6,"works well enough. the app at time throws too much info at me. I search for a available music and comes back with an avalanche of info. I just want to see albums related to groups, not umpteen singles, or related music, etc. if this were cleaned up it would be a much more usable app."
13013,AmazonMusic,V. M. James,4,35,I enjoy the variety the service offers and not having commercials. I do have difficulty with the portability of playlists from one device to another.
13014,AmazonMusic,bryan fraser,4,2,"quite good to use. one downside is each track added to a playlist has the album added to your album list, even if you dont have the rrst of the album. this then causes the album list to fill rapidly."
13015,AmazonMusic,A Google user,4,1,"So far, good app. Although not able to find everything I like to listen to however plenty of choice and app works well."
13016,AmazonMusic,Danny Martinez,3,17,it's a great app with tons of music but it gets confusing on what you're doing sometimes and also I decided to stop paying for the music unlimited and it stopped letting me listen too all my music and It deleted all my downloaded music and offline playlists I think it was dumb and I should of been able to keep all my music I already downloaded
13017,AmazonMusic,Adishwar Kaplash,3,0,Some popular songs not available. Howmany music apps should a person keep. Player interface is quite good. But user directions must be provided for new users ..or learn it by hit and trial .
13018,AmazonMusic,Charles Ryan,5,13,"Great music selection, even from artists that aren't mainstream. Love listening to music on our Echo Dots."
13019,AmazonMusic,Shannon Palmer,3,1,a little confusing and I can only see part of the titles of the albums/songs in portrait or landscape. They should really wrap around.
13020,AmazonMusic,Amy Crow,5,1,"Love thisapp! it's the only one I've found that lets you download complete albums, and provides lyrics."
13021,AmazonMusic,A Google user,1,249,"Paying for a service that works some times. Half the time the service doesn't work. When it does, you look at one album, then it won't open any more. Just get the spinning wheel of confusion like it was asked it to do to much. Sometimes it's days before it works again and then one album only, again. Won't play songs that have been down loaded that used to play in ""Offline"". Says some songs are on an SD card that I've never had."
13022,AmazonMusic,Siorsid,2,72,"Used to be fine but now constantly jumps and skips. It's like a scratched CD, every song skips a bit and it's annoying as anything. I've got no other apps open, I've tried switching the phone on and off but it still does it. What the hell is wrong with it???? Update, now alexa keeps interrupting songs. Get a few seconds or a minute into the song and alexa comes in telling me to ""try saying....."", well I don't want to, all I want to do is to listen to the song. Stop interrupting."
13023,AmazonMusic,Megan Herring,5,161,"absolutely my favorite music option hands down anytime. I'm not looking for anything ""like"" what I want to listen to, I'm looking for EXACTLY what I want to be listening to. With internet access or without, thanks to download options.....amazon music app gives me what I want when I want it. I have recommended it to every music lover I know and the feedback is consistently great!! thank you!!"
13024,AmazonMusic,Nona Pic,4,3,"I pay for Amazon prime,& this app is supposed to be free,with my prime. well it's free, I can download music,but then it starts ""blocking"" various songs I have ,& require me to pay for the unlimited version in order to receive the music, so basically it only gives you the music for a short time,then deletes it if you dont upgrade! Not happy!!"
13025,AmazonMusic,Joseph Supple,1,17,broken. does not work after os upda Used to be a good music app. No More. Amazon Music Used to be a good music app. But - No More. It tries to upsell you to get Amazon Music Prime with an add that stops you before going into the app. No matter how many times you have selected Offline Music it puts you into Online Music for searches. It appears you can't consistently play music that is on your device without a network connection. It just took me 20? 25? minutes to play two songs in my library.
13026,AmazonMusic,Tejas Vatsa,3,5,"When I play the first music in the app, I can move to next song but cant go back to previous song in the queue. If I am playing a music from the top of the queue then pressing the previous music button must take me to the last song in the queue but it does not. It is very irritating and you have introduced it in any of the updates. Please fix it."
13027,AmazonMusic,Todd Griffith,1,13,This app was great when i first started using it 4 or 5 years ago. It's slowly gotten worse and worse. I regret the amount of money I've spent buying albums I can't listen to because of this unstable app. Do not make the same mistake I did. App constantly crashes and gives a #183 error. I redownload and reinstall and we start the cycle all over again.
13028,AmazonMusic,A Google user,2,33,"App has some annoying ticks. They should get rid of ""online"" and ""offline"" playlists and just have one kind of playlist. Right now you cant play any songs in your offline playlist if you've chosen to listen to music online. Surely you should be able to access ALL your music/playlists while you're online, because you're... online! The songs you haven't downloaded will obviously not play if you're offline and not streaming, so it's ridiculous to set up to different kinds of playlists. 2 stars :-("
13029,AmazonMusic,Jake Abbott,3,103,"it's not without issues. Works okay if you have good service. Even offline, downloaded music will only play one song at a time if you have little or no service. Then you have to go back and select a new song. Also many of my favorite songs or albums I have downloaded suddenly. Are no longer available on Amazon music. When I first signed up for prime it was awesome. in the last few years, like most service from Amazon, in my opinion it has taken a sharp turn downhill."
13030,AmazonMusic,Trevor Underwood,5,213,"An easy to use app with a variety of music. though sometimes the more obscure songs may be removed from the list (most likely because the provider changed) you more often than not find and add them to your list again. Through easy set up playlists to just genre based stations, this app has been a go to after trying several others, and i am sure you will feel the same wheb it comes to selection and ease of use"
13031,AmazonMusic,Kathryne O'Rourke Cooke,5,5,"I love that I have found what I'm looking for each and everytime... having lost so much downloaded music over the years to ""crashing computers"" this app is a god send... love ya Amazon Music!"
13032,AmazonMusic,Tameka Burton,1,7,"I am a prime member and I also have the kindle unlimited app, a fire stick, now the music app. This app sucks royally the music played is not a real variety this need to be fixed. If I choose artist station the same songs should not be play more then once, with the amount of songs that's out there. This needs to change or I will go back to Pandora!!!!"
13033,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,87,"I always find the music I'm looking for. Great sound quality. Excellent features without being bloated or trying too hard. This has replaced all other music apps I've used, as it exceeds their form and function. Plus, if you're already a prime member, the service is included. Just give Amazon a hug already."
13034,AmazonMusic,Tom Norton,1,3,"Great for music purchases. But, really not very good on music playback. Frequently, crashes, can't find stored music(purchased from Amazon) on SD card, says my purchased music not downloaded when in fact it is. Bottom line great for purchasing. Otherwise, the app """"sucks"""". 2018.10.15 - Latest update is a real stinker."
13035,AmazonMusic,Gwampa Camacho,2,2,"Nice selection but some silly bugs can make the app a pain to use. Sometimes ill click on a new song or album just and instead of playing the song i wanted it just continues playing the current song. Also some albums will suddenly have the songs out of order and there is no option to sort the music aside from downloading, creating a playlist, and then entering the songs in the correct order. A lot of extra steps just to enjoy music. A few embarrasing bugs from a company with tons of resources."
13036,AmazonMusic,Jason H,2,8,I used to love this app. Lately I've had tons of issues with it. I'll start a song I've purchased and it'll start for a second or 2 and then no sound at all but the song is still playing. My media setting are set to high and still nothing. If I purchase music I'll use it but I'll just download it to my device and stop using the Amazon player.
13037,AmazonMusic,A Google user,5,11,"BEST music app! It has everything. You can easily find any song or album. You can find any type of category or stations. Any type, decade, soundtracks, genres. You can download any song, artist, similar music, or album. You can listen offline or stream online. The sound quality is amazing. I downloaded & tried nearly every music player, equalizer & mp3 bass booster apps in Google Play & APK & none could compare to Amazon music. It's my favorite app. Thanks to developer for perfect music app!!"
13038,AmazonMusic,A Google user,1,33,"Getting worse with each update. OK so the offline mode was bad before. If you had no signal it would take up to two minutes to launch to a usable state. Now it also constantly nags you to allow streaming and downloads over cellular on launch. I think those so called devs have no concept of what offline ACTUALLY means. Edit: Downgraded again. Asked me 7 times to enable Cellular access. Tried to download several albums, just kept saying an error has occurred try again. Thats just the start."
13039,AmazonMusic,Nick Smith,3,27,Awesome selection of songs... but app has been stopping a lot lately when playing through my car. also the song info in my car is spotty... when playing my library off my phone this always works. seems to be a recent issue just with Amazon. It seems to like to play the same songs over and over even though I have thousands in my music. Works better on my Alexa devices at home than on the road. sure hope they fix this
13040,AmazonMusic,Karen Hyers,5,0,love everything about it. Connects to my Bluetooth speakers and I can listen to almost anything I want anywhere I want.
13041,AmazonMusic,John Wolf,1,24,"Could and should be much better. Whenever you open it the app reverts back to some song I listened to a long time ago. Even when cache is cleared. Also, locks up a lot. Update, keeps getting worse. Now in midsle of listening to an album streaming to an Echo it changes over and starts playing another artist. Crazy"
13042,AmazonMusic,Chris Smith,1,292,"when I first got this app it was excellent included all music but now I have to pay Â£7.99 per month to get what I originally had as being a prime member. I don't use it enough to warrant paying this, and the music I saved or favourited is no longer accessible. what's left is not really to my music taste."
13043,AmazonMusic,Nipun Grover,1,5,"This app has major flaws , so many bugs and it clears up my queue suddenly , sometimes i can't change position of songs in queue , removing songs from playlists is really tough . i think wynk music was a much better option even though it had ads but this app has issues Amazon is not fixing . i am thinking of switching back to wynk as this has major flaws and has greatly disappointed me ."
13044,AmazonMusic,A Google user,4,185,I've given this app multiple chances including prime subscriptions and it still doesn't seem to pan out to my liking. I'd again rather just purchase my songs thru this app to sync to another music app that complement a simple music genre playlist of my choice. This app is also suppose to automatically download my new purchases when set to do so thru the settings menu and it doesn't. I have to manually download after each purchase everytime...very annoying.
13045,AmazonMusic,nihal antony,2,4,"My biggest problem is with the search results for the songs, especially searching for songs using Alexa. A lot of times the first recommendation is not the original audio, it'll be a remix version or a cover by someone else. A lot of times it'll show of times it'll show less popular songs with a similar title"
13046,AmazonMusic,TheYellowBow Woods,1,3,Ive used this app for years and it was an amazing app until they added unlimited- an add on subscription for access to more music. Which was annoying. Thats what Prime used to be for. i thought you could still just buy the music. WRONG. if you buy music that is unlimited it will NOT let you download or listen but it WILL take your money. ive contacted help before and theyve just given me refunds but not taken care of the issue that i still would like to purchase the song and listen to it.
13047,AmazonMusic,Craig Reynolds,1,9,"Great app spoiled by upgrade. In the last few weeks they have taken the ability to filter new albums ans songs by genre, which means their opinion of what is a good new album takes precedent over the musical tastes if the user. Poor form amazon. Spoke to customer service, they agree the upgrade is poor. Please put back this basic feature."
13048,AmazonMusic,Shannon Jones,1,4,"the reason I'm giving this app an 1 star rating. is because I don't like the fact; that Amazon is removing free songs that weren't on Amazon unlimited and putting them on placing them on Amazon prime. I'm already paying a monthly fee for Amazon prime, and and Now I have to an extra fee for free music. no"
13049,AmazonMusic,Nathan Foster,5,1,Some of the UI functionality on the mobile phone could be a little bit better...but I love Amazon music!
13050,AmazonMusic,Jeff Potsworthy,1,25,"I loved this app, when I first got it. However, since the most recent updates it got worse and worse. The Alexa update was cool and novel, good to show off to your friends. But, with that update came a travesty, all the music i downloaded for offline listening just stopped working. It said to refresh my music which i did repeatedly but it didn't work. Both these playlists were well over 200 songs long and i cant remember all of them nor the order. To make matters worse, i constantly lose music."
13051,AmazonMusic,Anil Kakde,2,38,"It has all the songs. But, (1) I'm an audiophile. The music quality is not comparable to lossless formats (FLAC). All songs seem to have a prebuilt EQ that prevents me from getting quality on pro equipment (2) The widget works only when the app is running. It should work no matter what. (3) The navigation on the app is not fully intuitive. Once you play a song, it is really difficult to navigate back to your playlists. Hopefully it will all get better."
13052,AmazonMusic,Sherida Glover,5,67,"I can buy songs I want without the whole cd but better, I can listen to music I don't want or need to own. This lets me discover new artists, especially through the playlists but it also lets me put together playlists of my own for visits with my granddaughter (who really needs to own Baby Shark?) and pull up songs when someone says ""Do you remember that song...?"" With the app, I can listen to music while I use other apps even if I'm not broadcasting to speakers.. Youtube doesn't work that way."
13053,AmazonMusic,Connor McGill,2,1,"There are still some nasty bugs that need to be worked out. When I add songs to a playlist it deletes a random amount of songs from that playlist. Also sometimes when I am using a playlist and click a song it will only play the one that is 4 spaces above it. very annoying, our lord Jeff Bezos would be disappointed:-("
13054,AmazonMusic,Blondekid42,4,0,"I love that I can get practically any song I want after paying for the Music Unlimited. I hate that said songs I get are randomly ""unavailable in the catalog"" and can only then listen to them if I go purchase the song(s) taken from me. I understand that the songs are ""free"" to listen to, but taking away songs I enjoy is frustrating. A good majority of what I listen to is there, but some that I love are being taken away. It's not a bad app, just 50/50 if your songs are there for free."
13055,AmazonMusic,redbeardsaint,5,2,I still buy my music on CD because I like the artwork and it makes me feel more in touch with the artist. as far as I know Amazon music and Amazon are the only place you can buy the disc or vinyl and also own the mp3. This insures you own the music forever regardless of whether the subscription lapses or the platform (like zune) disintegrates. For me there's nowhere else I would pay for a subscription. In addition the reccomendations and keeping up with new releases is spot on.
13056,AmazonMusic,Robbie Medina,3,0,"I love this streaming service for what it is. there's a fairly great selection, with incredible quality, and the ease if use is top notch. The only problem I have with it is that, in the recent updates, whenever listening to an album for the first time, the songs get completely shuffled after. The only fix is to download the album, close the app, and reopen it. Being more of an album listener than a station listener, this is fairly important to me. Other than this, I wish more songs had lyrics."
13057,AmazonMusic,A Miller,2,286,Going to cancel my membership. the app over the years has degraded to the point where it seems that they want to push you to purchase or download their music. at this point I'm not even able to search the music that I've already purchased to find a particular song when it's in the offline mode. I'm going to go ahead and go to Spotify or one of the other music agencies and purchase that my music there for now on or even Google.
13058,AmazonMusic,Jyothi Nayak,2,0,"In My Music, I am unable to get Artist option. I can only see Playlist, Album, Songs and Genres. I don't see any option to change this but in the help of Amazon music I see that Artists is an option. If this can be rectified, I would definitely give a higher rating. Also just to add on, there are several songs not available in the library."
13059,AmazonMusic,Brian Duke,5,0,"I use Amazon for just about everything. I have a few echo devices, which really works out when using this app. i have created a music group so that I can listen to music in all my rooms using the app. getting a phone call? no problem. because you are casting your playlist from your app, you can still use your phone without distributing your music. I love the app."
13060,AmazonMusic,Serenity Robinson,4,0,"Overall this is a pretty good app. The only problem I've had is occasionally I can't download music I've purchased to my phone. This only seems to happen after I've ""borrowed "" the music though Prime and then I decide to buy it. It will say I've purchased it, but won't download to my device. If I buy the music outright it will immediately download to my phone. I hope Amazon fixes this, then I would give it 5 stars."
13061,AmazonMusic,A Google user,2,2,"Although I am able to access almost all music, a few weeks ago I was going to play my music and more than half of it was gone. When I clicked on it, it said ""to unlock this song, you need to go unlimited for so and so a month"". Up until this point, almost everything on the app was completely free. I am considering switching back to Spotify now.ðŸ˜•"
13062,AmazonMusic,Carlos Callado,3,0,"the music selection is fine, but the user interface is trash. Following a band/artist you like seems to be pointless since they don't show up in the ""my music"" tab after you follow them. They only show up if you save their music to your device. Aside from that navigation is just clunky and it mistakes artists who have the same name and groups their music together even though it's entirely different bands and discographies. Overall it's passable, but pretty mediocre in my opinion"
13063,AmazonMusic,A Google user,4,4,"Great music app! Only downside, is I'd like a little more parental control to dare let my kids use it unsupervised. You can block explicit music, but not all explicit music is marked explicit. And many album covers to non-explicit music are definitely not kid-friendly."
13064,AmazonMusic,G A,5,0,I've had the app for almost a year and it's been pretty good! Recommendations/playlist have been spot on and suprising too. Its been cool to find bands/artist that I thought wouldn't be available! There have been a little over a handful of times that I've had some issues with connectivity. There's always room for improvements such as with the sound quality but overall really enjoying it!!!
13065,AmazonMusic,Molly Mellon,2,0,"This is buggy and annoying app. It crashes all the time and I am constantly having to go and clear the data and then start from scratch with all of my saved music. That being said I still continue to use it because I like having access to all of my Amazon music. I have an android so I am not sure how it works with other platforms. Because it is free, like I said I will still use it. But given the somewhat maniacal degree of Amazon superpowers, I'm surprised how poorly this functions."
13066,AmazonMusic,A Google user,1,0,if I would stop loosing music after it's in my playlist would be great. Pain in the ass to restore it back to the playlist. and what's this date and time stamp interruption. song cuts off half way thru saying I need to check the time and date stamp. nonsense. I call in but no one seems to know how to fix it. I'm about done with Amazon music.
13067,AmazonMusic,Alistair Heyes,4,0,"On the whole, very good. As with prime video though it is a shame Amazon feels the need to charge extra for a lot of songs and tv shows. Fair enough, put an extra charge on the very latest blockbuster movies and albums but you have very old songs, series and films that they still expect you yo pay extra for! Netflix definitely wins on this front."
13068,AmazonMusic,Joe Pfonner,2,0,"Nowhere near as useful or user-friendly as Spotify. It works terribly through Android Auto, which is how I use this service 90% of the time. It always freezes and resets the screen in my car. Also, even with the streaming quality set to Fastest Download, it still doesn't buffer anywhere near as quickly as Spotify. It gets 2 stars because 1) it's a decent music library (even if they removed one of my favorite albums) and 2) because it has Alexa functionality."
13069,AmazonMusic,Wayde J,2,1,"Needs a lot of work. Stored songs skip, sound volume is not consistent. The search function generally shows songs that are not included in the Amazon Prime account, trying to get members to pay more for a specific 'Amazon Music' membership over the already expensive Prime membership. Going to go back to Google Music and cancel Prime. Does not work with Samsung watches."
13070,AmazonMusic,Stepo Tronic,2,0,The app is full of really annoying bugs. One is that offline music very often does not display any info when starting to play it. After a while the information is loaded and then the current album is added to the queue multiple times. Another one is that it blocks mp3 files that have been removed from prime but have been bought and therefore can be played with other players easily.
13071,AmazonMusic,Ethan Mangerz,2,1,"I've had Amazon Unlimited to access a lot more songs. However after having to get a new phone, all the songs even the ones that you'd get for Amazon Prime are completely unavailable and I'm having to pay just to get songs I would otherwise get for free."
13072,AmazonMusic,Neil Ashton,5,3,"Love the music, love the choices. As part of my Amazon Prime membership, I'm able to pull up music that fits my mood anytime. I have a day at work each week when I shut off the phone, put on headphones, and listen to this music while I clear away the accumulated paperwork. Great way to block interruptions."
13073,AmazonMusic,Aaron Watson,3,8,Great app - great selection - clunky UI. Sometimes I get stuck in a song and there is no way to easily get back to the artist or album. Needs better or expanded navigation options when playing.
13074,AmazonMusic,Anna Jones,5,0,"I give it 10 stars!!! this app is amazing ! 0 ads whatsoever! all my favorite music is free and I love a variety of music! I can skip songs I like but don't feel like listening to, if you thumbs down a song itll skip for you and the best part is we can actually hit the ""go back"" button or ""last song"" button and its FREE!"
13075,AmazonMusic,Sriram Rao,2,0,"I have started to use this music app over Spotify for the song clarity. It's that good to easily differentiate. since i listen to limited number of songs, this app is sufficient. I still use Spotify for exclusives and better mix. I rate this app 4stars because they can improve app interface even more. I use the timer to stop playing music regularly. Overall, good. Update- For some reason, recent, new and famous songs are unable to be found. It's like their song library is shrinking daily."
13076,AmazonMusic,Janet Millard,2,2,"I usually love this app, but I can't find most of the music that I've paid for and supposedly download. I'd like to set a certain song as a ringtone and went looking. It turns out I'm missing probably 95% of the music in my library, whether I've paid for the albums individually or with music unlimited. That is bs."
13077,AmazonMusic,John Newdick,2,0,"I've been using this app for years and it's getting more and more in your face with how badly they want you to buy their things.  It opens to their store's page, but all I want to do is listen to music.  Like I do every time I open the app.  Out of service?  Then the app never loads, not even if you just want to listen to your mp3s.  If you leave the store open for more than a few seconds, another pop up assaults you, offering you Prime Music for a small period of time for a good price.    Get over yourself and let me listen to my music.  I'll search for new stuff when I'm ready."
13078,AmazonMusic,ibn r.,4,1,"I love this app. literally I use it every day. that fact that we pay for prime to use this should, music unlimited should already be included. I don't think we should have to pay another $8-10 a month to listen to the music I really want to"
13079,AmazonMusic,Mister M,2,2,"was a proud prime member, telling everyone the benefits and growth of prime video and amazon music. Now that they got a catalogue theyve raised the price of prime, and taken away music unless you pay for amazon unlimited, I feel betrayed. I feel theyve turnt on their loyal customers trying to make a quick buck, prime is no longer worth it, you're paying 100 a year for a mediocre at best version of Netflix, if you know what you want to hear amazon music is unusable. GET RID OF AMAZON UNLIMITED"
13080,AmazonMusic,Jan Schnee,3,2,lots of bugs when playing music or trying to download bought songs. Especially when it was accidentally put in the library in advance because it's prime. Ends up in a total mess. Otherwise the player doesn't offer any built in equalizer and doesn't work with the one installed. Not good overall.
13081,AmazonMusic,Cathy Chisam,5,0,"I absolutely love Amazon Music. i chose to pay the additional fee so I could have access to any song I hear. I have created several playlists. Music is my go to and this may seem silly, but my playlists are one of my most valued possessions. I never have to wait for a song to be over because I dont care for it. i love them all!"
13082,AmazonMusic,Caesar Gochi,1,4,horrible experience with thus app. DO NOT DOWNLOAD. if you tap on a song to play it will take more than 1/2 of the current song to actually start playing. Even on wifi (150mbs) it is extremely slow. As I am writting this it pops up as if it's going to play with an all grey screen. HORRIBLE HORRIBLE
13083,AmazonMusic,Jennifer Wark,4,0,Great selection of music. No commercials. I just don't like that you can't listen to all the music unless you get the unlimited version.
13084,AmazonMusic,Ryan Hardin,3,0,Interface is weird and it is just hard to figure out what is included from prime and what isnt. i wouldnt rate Spotify much better. just needs work still
13085,AmazonMusic,theother ai,3,0,"UI experience, Playlist curators, and radio is severely lacking in application and readiness. Ability to start the song from where you left off after pausing play and coming back to it later, and having to open the app again when reentering my car later is a novice approach. Engineers need to spend time with the Google play, Apple music, and Spotify to pick up some standard ideas."
13086,AmazonMusic,Dan Terhune,2,0,"Controls are clunky, downloaded music is hard to find in directory and not in the requested file format (e.g. .m4a instead of .mp3), and you can't dismiss the notification/controls from the system tray. It only gets a second star because it actually plays music. Very disappointing; I expect better from Amazon"
13087,AmazonMusic,Reyna,3,1,This app worked a lot better on Android 8.0 than it does on 9.0. I downloaded music to listen to offline and it will constantly stutter whenever my display turns off. The music controls in the notification bar don't work when my phone is unlocked.
13088,AmazonMusic,Anne Calderwood,4,0,it would be better if they wouldn't limit access based on a membership monthly fee. iTunes is doing that and they have strong-armed me into a membership or I can't load my library which I've been building for over 10 years! I'm going to go back to buying disks and using Pandora if this is the future of music.
13089,AmazonMusic,Mehrab Dastoor,2,3,"I use this service because I have prime and its included, but to pay for more songs and have more popular songs sung by cover artists instead of the actual artists is a big negative to me. Having no ads is nice, but I'd rather use another service if I'm paying anyway."
13090,AmazonMusic,Ashish Shukla,1,3,"after logging out, when i log in, then all the downloaded music just vanish. one has to perform all the downloading activity if you want to have it offline. I think total prime package is waste of money...."
13091,AmazonMusic,Satyam Kishore,1,0,"Pathetic app as it does not give an option to select which folders to add to for playing in offline music mode. I have call recording feature active on my phone and when playing offline music on Prime Music app, after few songs it starts playing the call recordings & WhatsApp audio downloads also. Seems like no one thought about it. Wynk is way better that way. It gives options to select folders to include for offline music playing."
13092,AmazonMusic,joseph edge,4,0,"I really enjoy the variety of music on the app and would give 5 stars but, I have an issue with the app constantly loading so the music cuts in and out on mobile device. I also pay for Pandora and do not have the issue using Pandora. If issue continues I will stop service and just use Pandora."
13093,AmazonMusic,Charles Timbers,3,0,the Amazon playlists are often ridiculous. if I choose Anthony Hamilton station I'm not in hearing profanity laced music by young artists. And if i just choose to listen to Anthony Hamilton Artist list all of his music does not play. i noticed songs from the Southern Comfort album doesn't play for example. Better playlists please.
13094,AmazonMusic,Liam Goodwin,1,0,"doesn't play songs continuously, always prompts you to sign up to unlimited stopping your current music, DOESN'T work on a PIA VPN they dont let you use it I dont want t to be tracked! repetitive choice in music, non inventive playlists, poor switching detection between wireless and 4g (using a Â£1000 flagship phone) radio playlists are always stopped telling you to upgrade to unlimited. why the hell do I pay for Amazon prime?!"
13095,AmazonMusic,Morgan Brandy,4,0,"Awesome design, love seeing the album artwork and karaoke feature. I bought this supscription to hear all Muse albums. Lots of latin artist representation. Some small acts too or less well known. Crashes like 40-50%. Often gets STUCK on offline playlist. Cantvalways change song in notification bar. Cant open it from my new phone! Bummer!"
13096,AmazonMusic,D Andrew,1,0,Amazon have changed home section and now you can only search the music they suggest and force on you in playlists or stations. No capacity now to search by genre. We've a monthly subscription for 4 devices and going to cancel and move to Spotify. Would strongly avoid against Amazon music. it's a dreadful streaming service relentlessly punting stuff st you which you don't want and stopping you searching for what you do want. Sadly cant give 0 stars!
13097,AmazonMusic,Dave Lawrence,5,0,"I had smartphones in the past, but never kept music on my phone. Lucked into Amazon music and love it. I found many songs I don't own for the other sources I use. Amazon has been good for me and I plan to keep ""Prime"" for as long as I can."
13098,AmazonMusic,Mike Haines,1,0,"This app constantly screws up, including numerous ways that just won't go away after each update. Ive all but lost hope for Amazon as a whole considering this app is almost as buggy as their Alexa devices. I wish you zero stars, and may God have mercy on your souls."
13099,AmazonMusic,Tia Gonzalez,1,5,"I have always loved this app, but it just doesn't work with my new phone, the Note 9, which is extremely upsetting. Songs don't play when they're supposed to, the app glitches and shuts off, my playlist changes for no reason, and sometimes, I can't even select songs, options, or categories at all. The recent update only made the problems worse. I would really appreciate it if Amazon could fix the bugs associated eith the Note 9."
13100,AmazonMusic,A Google user,2,5,"Main problem is that it opens into online mode, so when I'm in areas where I don't get service I can't access my offline music. Huge problem for me. Also the recommended music is often way off."
13101,AmazonMusic,Blake Foust,3,0,I have been having trouble with music that I buy and download not playing. customer support wasn't that much help. I have had to delete and redownload different things multiple times for it to work. burr im still having trouble with it.
13102,AmazonMusic,Boomer p,5,0,"I love this app! It allows me to listen to old tunes that only exist on CD's without having to buy them (or make sure I DO want to buy them. It also allows me a lot of flexibility in trying tunes I've only heard about. Obviously, I recommend it."
13103,AmazonMusic,Ruchika Ahuja,4,0,"Overall smooth app, no glitches. English and hindi songs collection is good. Some songs are missing, or sometimes even popular songs cant be found. eg ye dooriyan from love aaj kal. Likewise many good hindi songs are missing. But English songs generally I find. Great app. I love Amazon."
13104,AmazonMusic,Scott Broker,3,0,the playback sound is low and it needs to be increased. the amount of songs are incredible though
13105,AmazonMusic,Ian Band,1,0,"To many interferring advertisements. I know exactly the type of music I want and that's the music I'll buy; I really don't need access to 50 million songs, and I don't want thousands of advertisements for songs rammed down my throat!"
13106,AmazonMusic,Evan Swaney,2,0,"Loved this app until almost half of all my music that I've had access to for years is suddenly only available through unlimited. Very, Very disappointed that this is the case after ive already had access to the music I've now lost."
13107,AmazonMusic,Nupur Gupta,3,0,"The first song that I searched did not exist. If you can't have the latest trending songs. What good is your collection? But yeah, what this app lacks in collection, it balances in organizing its collection."
13108,AmazonMusic,Sweetheart Forever,5,0,"best music provider thus far and I have tried nearly all of them. absolutely love love love Amazon Music. so easy to find even the most rare song, set up of my own playlists are fantastic. i can save any song I like for listening later."
13109,AmazonMusic,Aa Aa,3,0,"i wish there was more music available included in prime. im thinking of getting that youtube thing with no commercials. many times when I want to hear a song, it's not available. what IS there, I do like though"
13110,AmazonMusic,Ryan Crane,3,0,"Lots of menus, which are pretty well organized once you figure how to use them, and head a nice clean look and artwork. But frequently freezes or gets stuck open (won't go away from menu bar even when you exit) which gets annoying."
13111,AmazonMusic,Andy Z,3,0,Lots of ads for Prime Unlimited and many of the previously available music for Prime is now only available for Prime Unlimited; should add an option to save the timestamp for longer audio files (I use Prime music to listen to my podcasts and whenever I exit prime I have to manually find where I stopped)
13112,AmazonMusic,Richard Arroyo,5,0,listen to the music that you want to hear. I hate music app with ads. None of the same playlists over and over. Totally worth paying for if you listen to music daily and don't want stupid ads in between songs.
13113,AmazonMusic,Bruce Mende,1,0,"use to be great, using Prime. Now Amazon has shredded my music list. Seems like a lose a song a day. Pay for unlimited? Always thought that what Prime came with. Won't be long till you pay for every song."
13114,AmazonMusic,Lou Valentine,4,0,"The Amazon Music app makes it easy to bring my entire music library with me anywhere I go. It does a good job of playing my playlists, my favorite Amazon Music stations, or specific artists and albums."
13115,AmazonMusic,Arturo Reyna,2,0,"it's cool but can be spotty in different areas, especially if you travel. I'm in Mexico right now, and i can say Amazon music sucks 0 stars, but in the United States, works fine, hmm...."
13116,AmazonMusic,Martie Newton,1,1,I'm fed up with it continually switching itself on the background and wasting my battery etc. I can't find any way to turn it off when this happens short of powering off my phone.
13117,AmazonMusic,Jennifer Sneed,5,0,I was originally skeptical about trying Amazon music but have come to really love it! No commercials/ads. Wide selection of songs. Syncs on all your devices so you've always got music you like.
13118,AmazonMusic,P K Gambhir,4,3,Like this app. Original soundtracks. Quality of music appreciable. Very vast collection. High quality recording.
13119,AmazonMusic,Rick Gallardo,4,0,"I really enjoy this app to the fullest, although when I woke up recently and went to listen to my playlists it seems like quite a bit of my songs have been blacked out and removed. Me no likey. â˜¹"
13120,AmazonMusic,Kari Mae,1,0,"Seems Amazon has jumped on the Sheep trail, they've gone and blocked root. Doesn't matter if you pay for Prime and Music Unlimited. You got root? Too bad, Amazon doesn't want your business."
13121,AmazonMusic,CLOS,5,0,"great sound quality, music variety, easy app navigation. reliable, no crashing. great app."
13122,AmazonMusic,Roanna Benfield,2,0,"I can definitely say you can't use this app when you're in a hurry. It has all the basic functions of a music playing app but takes so long to load. Even if you just want to see what you've downloaded onto your device, be prepared to wait for at least 5 mins."
13123,Apple Music,Halford 13,1,717,"looks like this app was developed by .... oh, no! the development of this app was managed by ""I don't give a dime about quality "" kind of people. It happened twice this week and couple more times in the past, that the app crashed and all my downloaded music is not available anymore. I checked the settings and shows that I have few GB of music downloaded. How can I have it back without re-downloading it? Poor management.., is managers fault because they are responsible if a worker is not good."
13124,Apple Music,Doug Stack,1,84,"Absolutely Unusable Music randomly stutters mid-song with intermittent pauses, and eventually stops playing entirely. Even worse, Apple hasn't responded to a single complaint that I've seen in these reviews. Even free, ad based apps tend to respond in an effort to make their users happy! Apple hasn't said a thing... Do they care? Are they working on the issues? Who knows? Save your money!"
13125,Apple Music,Brent Strecker,1,34,"had an iPhone. Apple Music worked GREAT! Got an Android, Apple Music SUCKS! Go figure. Takes a minute to load at times and I have to close the app and re-launch it. then it will pause itself, then when I try to tap play again, it pauses it it immediately. I enjoyed it before, but now I'm sitting in my truck after work trying to load music to calm my soul, and it will not work. C'mon man! I feel like a child of divorced parents. Apple and Android need to communicate better. SMDH."
13126,Apple Music,James Hann,1,16,"Suddenly stopped playing music! Will not play anything. Has no response when i try to play a song. No attempt to load or buffer, it just doesnt respond. Tried restarting my phone, reinstalling the app. nothing fixes it. this has happend numerous times now. sometimes it comes back after a few hours, other times it takes days. Embarrassingly bad for a company like Apple."
13127,Apple Music,Daria,1,181,"have been a client almost from tge start. Today got all my downloads deleted. it is more than 30 gbs of songs, which I have to now download manually.

I am trying to redownload my music. And I cannot download anything. Why am I even paying for this type of service anymore?"
13128,Apple Music,lee chacksfield,1,54,"I've had this app for over 2 years. I liked the simplisity of the app over all and it worked well for my daily use. Though I had many issues as the app would always crash, songs not playing because of no availability in this country (Jason Aldean...) slow buffer times with perfect connection, and these past two days (3/26, 3/27) the app not working at all when I try opening it up. I tried everything I could think of to try to fix the problem. I made the switch to spotify now cuz of this."
13129,Apple Music,Rese-a-Roni,2,290,The Apple Music app keeps crashing and has been for over a week. Why am I unable to now play certain songs or albums from my library that I upload from my personal CD's that are saved on my computer? I get an error about it not being available in my country or region. All the account functions that I can use on an Apple device should also be available on the Apple Music app also.

This usually happens after size of my downloads reaching 21GB and has happened for more than 8 times . FIX THIS PLEASE. (2). App is intuitive, but crashes really too much. Please, focus on stability. (3). Many Bollywood and regional albums are continuously being removed access to play from India. Why?? (4). Jittery(incompletely downloaded) version of the album cover photo displays sometimes. PLEASE FIX THIS."

It's fair for you to do it, if you want to keep your customer base, or it would disappear. take action"
13134,Apple Music,Barbara Aiello,1,70,I downloaded this app on my Android phone to be able to listen to MY MUSIC LIBRARY I've already purchased. After signing into the app I went to my library but in order to listen to my music I have to pay a monthly charge! This is total BS. I shouldn't have to pay to listen to the music in my library that I've already purchased thru iTunes. Could someone please explain this to me??? Thank you.
13135,Apple Music,M√©lissa Boswell,3,11,"I can still listen to music on this. However I have some problems. It drains your battrery. The music only plays when the app is open in the background, which is annoying because this doesnt happen on all my other music apps.

Just to name a few Cover arts: The cover art for my songs are all distorted. Repeat button: I sometimes like to listen to the same song over and over and... over again. But not even that works and that gets really annoying. Downloaded songs: dispite having downloaded all my songs they sometimes load like if they werent there.
13137,Apple Music,Lauren Hruszka,1,66,"This morning I have cancelled my membership. The issues with the app have been going on for 2 weeks now. First the entire app breaks and cannot be used for 4 days, and once it is fixed, the app is very unresponsive, constantly crashes and my music stops playing all the time. I'm fed up with it. I will not be recommending this to anybody."
13138,Apple Music,Stephanie Barnes,1,40,Apple music has been acting up lately. The music stops automatically and the app closes itself. I have tried on more than one occasion to uninstall and reinstall the app and nothing changes. I have reinstalled it (again) and now all I get is a white screen. It is also causing my phone to crash! This is incredibly frustrating as I pay good money for this service. Please fix this immediately!!
13139,Apple Music,A Google user,1,35,"App no longer works.It will not stay opened. Once i open it, it stars flickering rapidly on the initial screen, then it freezes and closes. Been found this for the last two days. I have installed it 5 times, rebooted multiple times. I've cleared the memory (cache), but nothing works. Also received a message to renew my student membership but I'm no longer a student and when I select that option it does not do anything and still asks the same question every day."
13140,Apple Music,Adara Faye,1,22,"Won't let me sign in, even though I have apple music on my iPhone and it works just fine so I know that my password is correct. I've been trying for two days with my cellular data or with wifi it just won't work. when I got my new phone I didn't want to lose my money or my music but I guess I just have to redownload spotify because this app refuses to work on my phone."
13141,Apple Music,Ben MioVur,3,148,"this app is frustrating sometimes. when it works, it works. when it glitches up, you sometimes have to just let it go, uninstall and reinstall until it works again.... and then redownload your library, unless you live for streaming. honestly though, last I checked I still required a live connection in order to play my 'downloaded songs' which I guess format technically say ""offline listening"" so it's not 100% lying to us, but still. there should be offline listening available"
13142,Apple Music,Erik Dreyer,1,10,"The app wants to use data even when you tell it that it may not use mobile data. it keeps on downloading thumbnails over data, thus when you are on data you can't listen to anything because it tells you to connect to wifi, so you have to turn your mobile data comepletely off then only can you listen to your downloaded songs. I have made many complaints about this, but they just don't care because they know they are the cheapest offer for a student."
13143,Apple Music,Sarah White,1,300,"I use to love this app and then for some reason today it stopped working! When I lpen it all I get is a white screen. To make sure my phone wasn't acting up I restarted my phone and it still didn't work. I then uninstalled it and reinstalled it and still the white screen. Extremely frustrating, especially since I pay for it and it's not free! Please fix immediately!"
13144,Apple Music,Jeremiah Williams,1,210,Nothing but problems. I wouldn't expect nothing less from Apple. If your not using there stuff on their products it's trash! App keeps force closing and messing up period. Apple does this on purpose because they want you to use their product. They are no better than VW tricking people on emissions on their vehicles.
13145,Apple Music,Djthegamer988,3,26,"This was an amazing app before the March 29th update. My Downloaded Music tab keeps disappearing, and when I check the settings, it says I have no downloaded music while also stating that my downloaded music is taking up 1GB of my storage space. I'm not trying to redownload my music a third time. Hoping this gets fixed as soon as possible."
13146,Apple Music,Sorrel Beach,2,99,The app stops playing after a few songs or halfway through a song. You have to manually go to the app and press play again. Very frustrating especially when driving. Sometimes have to click on a playlist multiple times just to get it to load. Instead of adding new features every update focus on fixing the bugs in the current version.
13147,Apple Music,lucy beckett,1,2,great when it works. keeps telling me to connect to the internet to listen to downloaded songs. very slow. last week it didn't recognise my account and I had to reinstall and set a new password! changed to 1 star because despite all of my music being downloaded to my device it won't play anything unless connected to the internet so it chows my data when I'm in the car!
13148,Apple Music,Matthew Patterson,2,3,The bug that caused the app to stop unexpectedly appears to have now been fixed. A lot of the album art is distorted and let's down the visual experience. Annoying that you can't download all your music in the cloud at once and have to go through and select each and every song/album individually. Please fix these issues and incorporate into Google Assistant and I will happily give you 5 stars. Otherwise Spotify is starting to look good...
13149,Apple Music,Sheri-Lynn Miller,1,56,"Wow. Glad to see I am not alone. I thought I was going crazy this week with Apple Music. I refuse to use Android Auto because its absolute garbage. I love my Samsung phones and will never go back to iPhone. But I do have an iPad mini 4. I'm considering throwing in the towel on apple music. YouTube premium, and possibly back to Spotify."
13150,Apple Music,Tyson Schrapel,1,3,"Terrible, do not download. Constantly pauses the music playing, the ""radio"" has more issues than my love life. One minute it will play through all of charting now the next it gives you 2 songs to play through. the playlists sometimes load empty and the app has to be restarted. the app force closes almost every day. Honestly I can't believe i ever paid for this, dont make the same mistake."
13151,Apple Music,Eric Sheu,1,6,"Horribly laid out. They tried to cram three apps into one and what came out was an illogical and non-ergonomic app. On top of that, they push their radio services on you to no avail by not letting you remove the tab creating a useless button AND (get the nerve of this) every time you re-open the app while using it, the app will default to the radio tab. What a wonderful combination of force-feeding and product placement. It's just desperate at this point. HIGHLY considering Spotify."
13152,Apple Music,Dean Calvo,2,54,Is this seriously the best your developers can do? Where is the quality control? Previous update paused after a couple of songs. Now with this update it only shows a white screen. Seriously considering dropping Apple Music! UPDATE ... So I hot it working by uninstalling everything and reinstalling fresh. Not acceptable in my opinion...as I was forced to redownload all my music. Who appreciates having to redownload thousands of songs?
13153,Apple Music,cheeseburger t-rex,1,10,I've had the app for over a year and a half now and never had problems but I upgraded my phone to the s10 plus and no more music. All i get is a white screen but it works on my other devices. I've uninstalled 4 times and restarted my phone quite a few. Please fix this before i delete and seek a new service. I really like apple music
13154,Apple Music,Derek Anhorn,1,7,"Download this app to cancel the subscription your daughter signed up for. *ugh dumb* After you login you'll notice you can't actually view those subscriptions. Options are: ""Get 3 months free"" or ""Redeem gift card or code"". EPIC FAIL! Great, now I can wait till I get home to forget to use her iPad to fix this train wreck. (Hundreds of dollars a year for a stupid kids game. For other parents: don't give your kids the password no matter what.)"
13155,Apple Music,Robert Smit,2,64,"Not loading on Android Auto. Display states, ""Apple Music doesn't seem to be working right now."" Signed out of Apple Music on my phone then signed back in. Restarted my Samsung Galaxy S8+ several times. Checked cable. All good. Repeated several times. Pandora and Google Play Music is working fine.  No issues.  Car is a Ford Fusion Energized 2018. It worked in the past just fine before the last 2 updates several days ago. I now launch the app first on my phone then plug in, it works!"
13156,Apple Music,Tori,1,5,"I did the update that was supposed to resolve the issues the update before it caused. I even uninstalled/reinstalled it..... Hey Apple, IT'S STILL NOT WORKING. It's crashing twice as often as it was before, AND now it reloads my entire library EVERY time I reopen the app. Does every single thing about Apple have to be a frustrating, complicated mess?"
13157,Apple Music,Colman,1,39,"after the latest update this app got more bugs than before. i spend my money for that and what i have is just a lot of problems with this app. sometimes i press play but this disgusting app doesn't want to play a song, more of then when add some songs to my library or playlist after some time it says I'm not able to play this song in my region. one of the worst apps I've ever seen. if somebody wants to get this app you should know you will get alotta problems"
13158,Apple Music,Connor Matthew Watson,1,57,"my apple music has been working well for around 2 years now, but over the last week it has been anything but enjoyable to use. its deleted all of my downloads twice now, (I have over 800 songs and it takes hours to download) and the songs constantly glitch or stop playing completely. it's been incredibly frustrating and I'm considering moving subscriptions at this point as im sick and tired of putting my music player to chance."
13159,Apple Music,Eddy Ortiz,1,5,if I could give 0 stars I would. the app was great but ever since March it closes on it's own after maybe 3 songs it just closes...but says its playing in the background and it says the song has been playing for 1:34:26. so the app is running after I force close. Also the songs that I have downloaded still skip like if I was losing connection or just lagging. As I type this at work it is skipping it's like I have a CD player in my pocket.
13160,Apple Music,Andrea Moyle,1,6,"Same as everyone, last update broke it. I can still play songs but they often sound like a scratched CD, skipping and stop-starting. Then it just crashes completely and I sometimes get the white screen of death when trying to open playlists. This subscription isn't cheap - please fix! It's a great app when it's working! edit: I wrote the above nearly 4 weeks ago and nothing has changed. Cancelling my subs shortly as this is ridiculous."
13161,Apple Music,Akintunde Obafemi,1,24,"The app is crashing constantly and it's now to the point where I can't even play music because the app won't even function right. The edit playlist feature doesn't work and when you do save your edit it doesn't save when you go back to it. Is this another thing of Apple making services worse for Android users like snapchat and Instagram, idk but I'm not paying for trash service."
13162,Apple Music,Edgar Medina,1,4,"been using this app since it came out on android. its awesome overall but since last update(march29), it's been slow to load and it constantly keeps on crashing and freezing at time. definitely a big problem and very frustrating and annoying. I'm at the point of just canceling it al together. This app needs a lot of attention."
13163,Apple Music,JOHN CROW,2,4,"Why is this app becoming such a headache to use!? Locks up constantly (endless buffering), acct credentials need to be restored daily, downloads freeze up or just never complete, etc. If you're not already paying for AM think twice before signing up to use on non-iOS device. Going to start exploring other services; the costs are all similar, music catalogs share some similarities, but app performance on some of the others have to be better. Any suggestions?"
13164,Apple Music,Erving Velez,2,24,"Apple still has not fixed the issue with editing playlists. When you enter one of your playlists and tap on the search icon on the upper right and then hit the back icon, the three dot menu appears with the edit button but it crashes the app when you tap it. Also if you are on airplane mode and you go to one of your offline playlists, the playlists shows a message to turn on WiFi and no songs are listed. Please fix these old lingering bugs."
13165,Apple Music,Harriet McHale-Owen,1,5,Had been working reasonably well (although not as smooth as on iPhone) however the last few days has lost all downloaded music and have been left unable to play any music at all despite all the usual tricks to restart the app and phone. Left very disappointed as this is a monthly subscription which isn't cheap and has left me looking for alternatives. edit- I have now cancelled my subscription as I need a more reliable streaming service.
13166,Apple Music,Eric Klonowski,1,1,"Fantastic on apple devices. curated playlists, beats 1 is good, content is great. Unfortunately though it seems that nobody at Apple can write a stable Android app. Constant stalling in playing music even when it is cached or downloaded to the phone. Works great when it works, frustrating when it doesn't. Can't recommend a music app that works 6 times out of 10."
13167,Apple Music,Adam Cab,1,20,"Don't install update!!! I can't even use the app anymore (still), even after update from 2.8.0 to 2.8.1. It won't open like others here, just a white screen. Apple.... Hire actual android engineers because you clearly have android users who pay for your products even though there so many other options."
13168,Apple Music,Michelle Kotze,3,33,"The app was amazing at first. User friendly, had all the music I wanted to listen to and it worked perfectly considering the fact that I use it on android. But after the last update I can't even open the app. When I try to open it, it only shows a white screen. I even tried uninstalling and re-installing it but it made no difference. PLEAS FIX"
13169,Apple Music,Darius Palmer,1,13,I never write reviews but this time I had to. I enjoyed the Apple Music app for a while now and I pay a service fee just like everyone else...AND just like everyone else since the update I cant seem to get it to open. It's just a plain white screen then it crashes. I'm considering cancelling the membership and move on to YouTube Music if this problem isn't resolved within the next few days.
13170,Apple Music,Wayne James,1,4,Really awful App. The music just stops for no apparent reason. Its really annoying especially when driving or in the gym and you have to get your phone to press play again. I'm only putting up with it as its a free promotion with my phone. As soon as promotion finishes ill be switching to a different music App for sure.
13171,Apple Music,Rahal Wimalasiri,1,2,it was all fine until I upgraded it in to family membership. it still works fine but doesn't allow me to add new family members. When I click add family members it says enter my password which when I do the page keeps loading and never processed. or asks me to enter a verification code that they send to my mobile which again I never receives. please fix this bug for me
13172,Apple Music,Jordan Ellis,1,86,"The latest update has removed the ability to see the song/albums that I have downloaded to my phone. And songs that were downloaded don't seem to be indicated as such anymore, yet my phone's memory still clearly shows that a large amount of memory has been taken by the aforementioned downloaded songs. please fix this."
13173,Apple Music,Ismael Aguirre,1,2,"The app was great after many bug issues being fixed, but after the last major android software update it went back to having the same bugs and issues as before. Playback ALWAYS stops for no reason at all, it seems to happen more with songs I listen to more often. It also crashes at least 3 or 4 times a day. Some songs have an infinite amount of playing time AFTER the song has finished which is annoying as it simulates playback stopping and nothing plays until I have to personally change the song"
13174,Apple Music,EliteCheezGaming,1,15,"This has has been working fine for the last few months and all of a sudden the app stops playing music when connected to bluetooth on my F-150. I have to smash the play button just to get one song to play. I pay for this service, get it together Apple. I glad I am not alone here. What a joke Apple, you guys make billions and your R&D team can't even get connectivity issues handled."
13175,Apple Music,Diana Boncheva Kirilova,1,3,"FIX PLEASE! Obviously the app doesn't work on Android 9! DEVELOPERS do your work and don't redirect people to talk to android support. That's ridiculous, Android 9 works great, your app doesn't! Still waiting for you to fix it, but probably gonna cancel my subscription. I'm paying and can't listen to a single song!"
13176,Apple Music,Lara 15,2,1,"For the past week, my music has been buffering and stuttering, as if there is poor connection. It happens whenever I listen to any song. Also, often the app suddenly out of nowhere stops working. I am so upset that I am paying for something with the same problems I'd have with a free app. Its ridiculous!!!!"
13177,Apple Music,Mallory Hansen,1,112,after this last update my app wont load a thing. i seem to not be alone on this problem. i also have been having trpuble with the app pausing my music randomly while switching songs . i use a bluetooth connection to listen while driving and it requires me to open my phone to restart the music. update: i spoke with your tech support line and still nothing is done. its been three days. cancelled my subscription amd i expect a refund for the month. i have filed a claim. ridiculous.
13178,Apple Music,Natnael Mousie,1,13,"I wish I could give this 0 stars. Ever since the most recent update the app hasn't been opening. All I'm getting is a white screen followed by my phone telling me Apple Music has stopped working. I'm gonna need yall to fix this ASAP. My phone is a Samsung Galaxy S7 which is three years old, but if my cousin's iPhone 5s can load Apple Music efficiently then I don't see why mine can't."
13179,Apple Music,Silvia Wilvia,1,5,"A lot of the music I had on iphone on apple music now on android it says no longer available. lost a lot of songs. Also somehow end up with diff versions of the song like a live version that I never had & the original is gone. also theres no way to auto download ALL music so it streams a lot and stops. I have to manually click every song for it to download. to top it off, it logged me out & when I logged back in, downloaded music is gone and I have to start all over download everything again."
13180,Apple Music,Ben Maclachlan,1,3,"I can't understand why a paid service has such a badly performing app. After using the iOS version for two years making the switch to the android version has been painfull. Every time the app is updated a new problem arises usually not fixing any old bugs. The most persistent bugs are; you are offline message when opening an album or playlist that has been downloaded, unable to play a specific song in an album or playlist without playing from the beginning and skipping through it."
13181,Apple Music,Pedro Henrique Garcia,1,82,"After these updates, it is crashing all the time. Apple Music has too many bugs, it does not cache my music library artwork, it does not display the edited album genre I set on iTunes, it is extremely slow to start streaming and crashes all the time. Album artwork will get mixed up. Apple products are just buggy and very frustrating."
13182,Apple Music,A Google user,5,96,"Holy HECK. You guys responded well to our reviews. You let us use phone's equalizer instead of the app's. It's more stable as well with zero lagging or crashing after the latest update. I WILL RATE THIS 100 stars if i could. Now this is a music streaming app I wouldnt mind paying for. Largest music libraries and A STABLE APP,WHAT MORE COULD I ASK FOR?!"
13183,Apple Music,Jill Lovejoy,1,18,I've had this for a few years now & never had a problem until the last month or so when it pauses in the middle of a song while I'm driving constantly. I gotta shut the app down & start over & keeps doing it so I switch it to Sirius. Definitely not safe when I'm driving. So irritating!!
13184,Apple Music,Justin Suchacek,2,3,"It was working flawlessly until yesterday afternoon. I had downloaded all 75GBs of music to my phone, Galaxy S10, so that I didn't use data streaming it, and though the app shows 75GBs of data in use, none of my music shows as downloaded, and it's wanting me to redownload everything, all over again. Tried clearing cache, restarting device, and looking for answers online, but nothing. Very disappointed with this bug, as I will have to delete the app and redownload album by album again."
13185,Apple Music,Oliver Color,1,5,Apple Music crushes every 10 mitutes and I have to download my music again and again. I use it for 1 year and I was totally satisfied. But latest update... It makes me cry... I don't like another music services and I don't want to dump Apple Music. I hope that bugs will be fixed in short time.
13186,Apple Music,Stephen Foreback,2,1,"super frustrated with app. just when I was almost done transfering my play list from Napster to apple the song will either stop playing, stop in the middle of the song, also sounds like the song is skipping like a scratched CD. I like it because it's cheaper than Napster also iam able to find more songs. but if this doesnt get fixed soon I will go back to Napster that I have been with for 7yrs. please fix issues"
13187,Apple Music,Danial Rafiq,1,2,"This has been going on for a few weeks now, without any fixes, why am i paying for a service that doesn't work? Music either stops midway through a song or doesn't play the next song. Extremely irritating as it is constant after a year of perfect use. Regardless of WiFi or mobile data use the problems persist."
13188,Apple Music,Lei Dobbins,1,44,"These issues happen randomly: Freezing, Crashes, Failure to load past a white screen with the iTunes logo, Does not recognize apple ID, Continually prompts me to verify apple ID and password, Does not recognize the included subscription via my Verizon plan and continues to prompt me to select a subscription option. I honestly am only trying to use this app because it's included in the plan. If i had to pay for this i definitely wouldn't bother with it."
13189,Apple Music,Rodney Espinoza,2,1,"I pay every, single, month for this and half the time the songs wont download to offline listening like Spotify does. Music doesn't download to the point where I will sit at work for an hour trying to get ONE SONG to play. No issue with Spotify or YouTube. Plan to cancel my membership if this isnt addressed. All my family has already quit Apple altogether and this is the last strand I've been clinging to."
13190,Apple Music,Nicole Parks,1,5,"Changed my rating due to the fact that my music cannot play more than three songs in a row without stopping, which forces me to unlock my phone just to push the play button again. Forget trying to listen to music through your car's speakers while driving, as it'll stop playing every 5 minutes - sometimes even in the middle of songs! And picking up the phone to unlock it to then go into the app just to push the play button again...is simply ridiculous. Fix your app. I'm canceling my subscription."
13191,Apple Music,Shelly Collins,5,5,"Had an issue with being unable to download anything but after the update(older version was preventing me from downloading in the first place), I'm fine and able to resume downloading once the update was applied. I've only had the product a few months but seems to not have any issues other than my one."
13192,Apple Music,Troy Haskins,1,1,it freezes and shuts down from time to time. also after registering my account for apple music as a student a screen keeps popping up requesting me to verify if I'm a student when I already did. after successfully doing several times I got tired and now I'm upset that I pay monthly for something I cannot even use due to the verification screen to see if I'm still a student.. sorry but im switching to Samsung music.
13193,Apple Music,Lisa Lisa Loo,1,1,"Thought I would give Apple a chance to change my (negative) opinion on their services and try their music stream, EPIC FAIL! This app/service just reminded me the reasons WHY I do not and will not own an iphone! NEVER PLAYED ANY MUSIC- Downloaded or streamed via radio station, NOTHING WOULD PLAY!! Im annoyed now that I went through the hassle of setting up another email feed I'll have to block from sending me emails and having to set up an Apple ID. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME... STICK WITH GOOGLE!"
13194,Apple Music,Nihar Sawant,1,20,"Shi**iest app ever. All of a sudden all my downloaded songs are gone. Now I have to download all of them again. This has happened 3 times in last 2 months. Plus there's no option to download all songs, you have to click on the download icon for every song like a donkey. App keeps crashing almost 10 times a day."
13195,Apple Music,A Google user,1,5,"If Apple can't make an app for Android, how can we trust their other products? App constantly prompts me to sign in, music randomly stops playing or won't load. It's such a headache constantly force closing and opening it up again, just got it to stop working after another 2 songs. It's terrible!"
13196,Apple Music,Subhadip Banerjee,5,6,"Superb music library with curated playlists! Only problem is the app is really buggy and unstable. Mine has been shut down 7 times in 3 hours playback. Just hoping for the best. Edit-1: after just one day of usage, I'm noticing abrupt removal of my downloaded songs. Moreover album art is getting glitched or removed without any reason. Edit-2: Don't know what kind of sorcery is but within two days of usage, crashing and rebooting have diminished significantly. Now it's working quite fine."
13197,Apple Music,Jonathan,1,21,"This App is way too buggy on an Android. It works well most of the time, however I experience problems on a daily basis when trying to listen to DOWNLOADED music on my phone. I'm not even streaming and I get an error saying that it can't connect ti the server. Then it completely deleted all of my downloaded music off of my phone. I used to love apple music, but I'm definitely switching to Spotify, hopefully their app is better."
13198,Apple Music,Tameka Corderoy,1,21,since the newest update it cuts in and out with the app crashing and im not able to get it to close down fully. even when manually pressing play again it does the same thing its almost like listening to a radio station cutting in and out. please fix asap. 6/4/19 songs are still juddering during play even after the newest update. its like listening to a cd that has scratches all over it! please fix this is ridiculous
13199,Apple Music,Dhruv Chopra,3,12,"usually I have been a big fan of the service and have downloaded tons of songs to listen to on the road. for the last 2 days however my app halts mid-song, crashes and then all my downloaded songs disappear. it still shows I have it in memory but no way to access it. I downloaded all the songs in my library again today but it crashed and was lost again. please fix this ASAP."
13200,Apple Music,HollowHills,1,1,"cant believe It took me so long to swap over from apple to andriod. best decision I've made in a long time. But being how over the years I've spent a ton of cash on music and apple being apple(greedy) wont let me transfer my already bought music to another app. the worst thing about my andriod phone is the one and only thing apple, this POS app. every song takes 1-5 mins load time before playing. if it even loads at all. unsubscribing and will never spend a dime on anything apple is involved in."
13201,Apple Music,Chad Morrison,1,1,I love apple music and it's awesome that it's now on Android. but the app needs some work for sure. - auto download doesnt work. - cannot add songs to playlists. only works 20% of the time. - Now playing screen doesnt show enough. need to scroll down to see shuffle and repeat.
13202,Apple Music,Michael Mango,1,34,update 2.8.1. constantly crashing this app worked fine on last update now it crashes every few hours. I like others get the dreaded white screen. I also like some others are pissed off because I too pay for Apple Music monthly if I knew it was this unstable I'd have kept my iPhone X since that player works fantastically with 0 issues. kinda bizarre it's the same exact thing but Android can't get it right.
13203,Apple Music,Yan Tkachev,1,4,"The recent update (05.04.19) erased all my downloaded music. When I go to Apple music settings, the app states that I have 19.26 GB of downloaded music. At the same time, if I push on this figure, the new menu opens and says that there are no downloaded songs on this device."
13204,Apple Music,Lee Lappin,1,2,"Maybe I was a bit na√Øve to think that Apple would be kind enough to provide a way for me to listen to music that I've purchased through their services for free. But regardless, Apple's money hungry attitude is ridiculous. I can't even look at my library without signing up for their stupid service. And I'm not about to pay $10 a month just for the privilege of listening to music I've already payed for. Get over yourself, Apple."
13205,Apple Music,ram rod,1,1,"Considering Apple in the past has throttled old devices and made 3rd party accessories on their devices obsolete, forcing users to purchase upmarked OEM parts, I wouldnt put it past them to give 2 care about clients on another platform. This app constantly crashes and I have a new S9. It's a complete waste of money. Going to spotify where it's cheaper and more dependable. F your monopoly and dirty tricks Apple."
13206,Apple Music,A Google user,3,24,"This app is amazing but recenty Ive been having problems with even opening the app. When I tap the icon it goes to a blank white screen and Im afraid if I force stop it, it would get rid of my songs downloaded. Im not sure what it is but I think the update had something to do with it."
13207,Apple Music,A Google user,1,4,"Great collection of music but even with regular updates the app keeps crashing and has a lot of bugs, has issues while downloading tracks and the app UI is great but is very laggy. Apple music being a paid subscription i don't understand why the bugs aren't fixed with updates. Please fix it ASAP before other music streaming subscription catch up."
13208,Apple Music,Dyanna Ferreira,1,14,"Terrible app. I try to play some music from a playlist and it work at first, and then at the second time just didn't let me listen anymore playlists not even the first playlist that i was listening in the first place. Restart the App and the problem continue. Apple support on its best -.-"
13209,Apple Music,David Simmons,1,16,"the only reason why I have Apple music is because I have so many songs downloaded and would hate to start over. but I'm high considering switching to another music service because apple music on here is straight trash. music constantly stops, doesnt load, has trouble playing in my Toyota Camry. it's sad to know that Apple, a big brand company, doesn't care about their customers who pay for there service. I need some kind of compensation for not being able to listen to music properly."
13210,Apple Music,Darius,2,1,"I guess ever since this new apple music update. My downloaded song stutter while playing. If I want to change songs in the car, it's like the app freezes until I pick up my phone and manually change songs. Songs I downloaded say I haven't downloaded them. Already restarted my phone, closed Apple Music, uninstalled/reinstalled Apple Music JUST to realize that it deletes all your downloaded music so you have to click thru every song to download again. Apple Music used to be very good. not anymore"
13211,Apple Music,A Google user,1,2,"-1üåü for downloading songs continuously -1üåü for songs playing out of order in playlists -1üåü for trying to stream songs even if downloaded -1üåü for saying playlist is not available when mobile data is not enabled, but you have downloaded it -1üåü(I do not have the option to take away 1 more star, but be sure if I could I would.) for loading a song continuously at times You have more than 40 million users on Android, try to respect us."
13212,Apple Music,Matthew,1,42,"The two latest versions have been crashing on me constantly. And to get it to work on Android Auto lately, I've had to close and reopen the app several times before it will actually play music. i love the service, but please fix this app. It is unbelievably broken."
13213,Apple Music,Stoo O,1,13,white screen on boot up as of this afternoon. have been a subscriber for years but the last few updates have made it less and less reliable. Also recently been getting an error where it will stop playing every two songs and I need to open the app to skip to the next track.
13214,Apple Music,Kiara Ochoa,1,5,"Even after the update the music stops playing, or when a song is over it doesn't automatically go to the next one, or skips while playing as if it were a CD player. I'm giving the app one more update, if it doesn't get fixed I'm uninstalling and cancelling apple music."
13215,Apple Music,A Google user,2,8,Music randomly stops playing.(shows time passing with no sound) i cant continue song until i manually fully open app and press play and even then the song will restart. this will happen multiple times to the point where this app is almost unusable. this happens 10/10 times. if i dont forcfully close app. it will be running on the background on play wastong battery. Just opened up a free month trial with Spotify. please fix or i will consider unsubscribing
13216,Apple Music,Arpit Thakkar,1,4,"After the latest update , the app is not working. It just stops once the app is closed. when the app is opened again, it does not work. it just shows blank images. does not show the controls. Very bad update. Even after subscribing to the service the app is not working."
13217,Apple Music,Sawcgurl,2,5,DO NOT GET this app has hone down so much i cant stand it anymore. the app used to be good but lately it wont play a song or it takes forever to do so. also right when your in the middle of ur fav song happy as hell it will shut down all of a sudden irritating af. there will also be songs you cant download on an album. you pay for an app you want quality not something that breaks down all the time now it seems they just want your money
13218,Apple Music,Cycling Masterclass,3,2,"Love the follow features and the ability to share playlists easy! And the radio recommendations are on point! 5/5 for that. BUT the app is super unstable and glitchy on my Android. Crashes often, can't rename playlists, download issues and when I close the app the music stops. Very counter intuitive. I use to use google play music, way better optimised for android and easier to use."
13219,Apple Music,Raymond Kosbar,1,9,"PURE S!-!IT app is constantly crashing and skipping this new ""update"" is more like a down grade GREAT JOB APPLE FOR SCREWING THIS UP! I cant believe I actually still pay for this garbage... All we want is an app that works like its supposed to and allows us to listen to what we want when we want it unlike spotify or pandora!!! DONT LET US DOWN APPLE... FIX THESE PROBLEMS! HELLO APPLE ARE YOU EVEN THERE! You have hundreds of poor reviews telling you what's wrong with your app! GET OF YOUR A$$!"
13220,Apple Music,Laura Evans,3,2,"Its really nice to be able to take my music on the go, but i keep having this error where i press the play list buttons and immediately after being taken to my playlists the screen goes blank and im back at my home page and cant access my playlists. have uninstalled and reinstalled the app countless times and the problem always comes back."
13221,Apple Music,A Google user,1,11,The app doesn't work properly at all. You have to restart it again and again. It takes awfully long to load songs or playlist and usually a blank screen appears. Now Im just getting a blank white screen since 5 hours. The app is not working at all now.
13222,Apple Music,Raelyne Moreno,3,7,"I've been using Apple Music for close to a year and have had no problems or complaints. Lately, however, when I open the app to play music, it will not play any of my music. I've restarted my phone, I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app and now all of my music is gone. If anyone knows of any solutions to this, they would be greatly appreciated."
13223,Apple Music,Matthew Brissette,2,36,App does not work 90% of the time I'm connected to Android Auto in my car. It's driving me crazy bc this is the subscription music platform i pay for and i EXPECT IT TO HAVE BASIC FEATURES like Android Auto support that actually works. It crashes the app almost ebery time i press the play button on my car's touchscreen!!!
13224,Apple Music,Michael Harmon,3,1,"I have loved this app since the day I installed it a few years ago. It has great features that I use all the time. Unfortunately, the most recent update released has almost completely ruined it's reputation as far as I am concerned. The app crashes multiple times on start-up before working, requires me to exit and restart to load library AND all of my music has been deleted!!!! I have paid for this service since the trial ended.....now I'm reconsidering."
13225,Apple Music,Lara Zakraj≈°ƒçek,1,9,"Edit; I just cancelled my subscription, because the lag in download mode is INSANE. Lemme know when you fix your app, because right now it's a waste of money. I pay for this and it keeps on crashing and lagging even when I'm offline and trying to play music I have downloaded. Please fix it, I really don't feel like switching to a different Streaming Music app but if i have to i will :/"
13226,Apple Music,Melissa Lopez,1,1,It used to be good. I have the Note 9 and the app keeps buffering like crazy. It randomly pauses the song or starts over when I didn't press anything or it crashes. I'm looking into an alternative app that doesn't pause my music. Don't waste your money on this garbage.
13227,Apple Music,Tyler Rogers,1,0,"Thought I'd try this for a while instead of spotify, what a mistake that was. It's not user friendly at all, even making a simple playlist is hard work. The app freezes everytime I go into playlists, so I have to close and re-open. Searching for songs is just hard work. The pre-made playlists are the worst thing about this, the apple music playlists are just simply trash. I won't be seeing out the length of my free trial, straight back to spotify for me!"
13228,Apple Music,Olive Fyfe,2,9,"Full of glitches. I can barely ever add songs to playlists or to my library. '0 songs added to playlist' always comes up when I try to add a song! My favourite artist Girli just released her first album and I cant listen to any of the new songs because it wont allow me to! They all play on my apple TV however it's in my living room and I dont want my younger siblings to hear the explicit songs so I cant even listen to them on that, which is why I'd like this app to work properly but it doesn't!;"
13229,Apple Music,Adrian Evans,1,1,I used Apple Music on my Samsung S8 & it was great... Once I went to the Samsung S9 I've had nothing but problems... I use a UE Boom 3 & its like I have an old transistor radio at times & the phone can be next to the speaker !! No problems with Sound Cloud so I can't see its a phone problem... If I hadn't spent money on a subscription I would have deleted the App... If anyone knows of a Sumsung equivalent I'm open to suggestions
13230,Apple Music,Jarett Penermon,1,1,"terrible. extremely slow on galaxy s9. i have to force close tye app multiple times for it to even play a song and it can take up to 30 seconds for a song to load. i have excellent data too, it even does this on wifi. Spotify is so much better, its only been 15 days into the 90 day free trail and im done with this app"
13231,Apple Music,Scott Mixon,1,93,Still shuts down and music still breaks up during playback even with newest update. It's Especially bad when using through bluetooth. only get 2-3 songs everytime before it stops working. All my other music apps work flawlessly through bluetooth. I Expect better from one of the biggest firms in the world. I'm currently Thinking about moving to Spotify if it's not back to what it was soon!
13232,Apple Music,Malcolm Terry,1,3,downloaded music keeps disappearing after update. songs occasionally get greyed out an become unavailable even if they've been downloaded. music playback randomly stops especially with Android Auto. I like the convenience but would reccomend an alternative. its unacceptable to pay for this when it works only 50% of the time.
13233,Apple Music,Georgia Damasco,3,1,"I am unable to search by song when within a playlist. Within the playlist I click ""edit"" and then ""add music"" - however when I search my library it will not bring any songs up, it seems to only bring up albums (which is no help if I don't know the name of the album of the song I'm looking for) This means I am currently having to scroll through the songs alphabetically to find and add them, very time consuming. I use this app for work so need it to function efficiently!"
13234,Apple Music,"Darren Biles, Jr",1,1,"Ever since the last update, this app has been almost useless. Everytime i hit shuffle on the library, ill get through a few songs, then the app crashes/freezes. have lost my offline library and have had to redownload over 900 songs. if it does it a 3rd time, i will be cancelling my $20 family subscription and i will switch to Spotify."
13235,Apple Music,Lauren Harris,2,2,I loved this app until a couple of weeks ago when it started skipping and stopping several times per song. It's frustrating and I am not enjoying it anymore. I have spent several years paying for this app and in that time building a great collection of music. I really don't want to have to change to a different music app.
13236,Apple Music,Alex Bradley,1,4,Apple Music is the best streaming service because of the way its laid out. I don't like the Spotify structure with all playlists and no 'Artists' 'Songs' 'Playlists' tabs. I've recently switched from Apple to Samsung and the Apple Music app on the Play Store is awful. The app crashes once a day. My music that I've got downloaded for offline listening will vanish and I have to re-download it with no quick way to do so. This needs addressing promptly or I'll have to switch to a different platform.
13237,Apple Music,TheLowKeyGamer,1,2,"After the most recent update I haven't been able to play any music, I'm on android and whenever I try play a song it says content not authorized: error code 22950 then when I search for this error code nothing comes up. It's been this way forever and it's becoming extremely annoying"
13238,Apple Music,Jonathan Sinclair,3,0,"This latest (I haven't updated since January 2018) has made streaming bad. Every time you want to listen to a new one, now one has to wait around 7 seconds for it to load. This is not a connection problem, since I can stream in 1080p anywhere without issue, and Spotify works fine. Please fix this, I don't want to have to use Spotify from now on."
13239,Apple Music,ain nabila,2,8,I cannot update my payment info. I tried to changed to another but is said unable to verified code when i update my phone number. And then i changed it to the old number i used before but the same thing happened eventhough it worked before using the old number. Now i cannot renew my membership
13240,Apple Music,A Google user,1,25,"constantly tells me my login is wrong when i know it's not, and when i listen to music for more than 30 minutes at a time the songs pause and skip every few seconds. half the time it kicks me off, too but i can't even get into my account to cancel my subscription."
13241,Apple Music,Pedro Marquez,1,6,this app on a galaxy note 9 and S7 (i used to use) is terrible. music takes forever yo download. im so glad i had a free month because id want a refund with how terrible it is. i had Spotify and wanted to see which of the too was better. my conclusion is that i will never be giving this another try.
13242,Apple Music,Ellliott ogrod,1,6,"If you want to make me keep using your streaming service you better make it accessible to android users. This app is complete garbage compared to the iPhone counterpart. It is slow, crashes often, and works a quarter of the time. Not impressed."
13243,Apple Music,Julia Morgan,1,5,"FIX your product, Apple, the last update was GARBAGE and so many people now cannot listen to music because whenever we try to load the app all we get is a white screen before it crashes. I will die without music. I'm going through a rough patch right now in life, so get your act together and FIX THIS."
13244,Apple Music,Grant,1,4,I'm really unhappy right now. I for some reason can't listen to the new Billie eilish album but some people can. This is disapointing and needs to get fixed. I've tried logging out and logging in and even restarting my phone. This is pissing me off
13245,Apple Music,Brad A,1,7,"Great, when it works. Absolutely broken on Android. Crashes CONSTANTLY during normal use and doubly so when connected to Android Auto. Makes me wonder how many car accidents have happened due to someone trying to force close the app and get their music to play again."
13246,Apple Music,Tyler Powell,3,2,This update tends to have a problem of not properly updating playlists. It will not save my playlists and revert back to an older version. It's very frustrating. I also can't update the pictures on select playlists. It will not save as well. Would appreciate if this would get looked at. It crashes all the time and just has troubles running on really powerful hardware that matches or exceeds iPhones
13247,Apple Music,Jordon Penn,1,1,"still buggy as hell after an update?!?! how is it that I can play music without issue on android auto, but that's IT?! I would really like to use this because there is music I can't access on my Amazon music, but at this point its unusable."
13248,Apple Music,Jessa Lorica,1,1,It's Crashing. I'm annoyed because the album cover isn't showing. It suddenly stops playing. It deletes my downloaded songs. I have to download them manually. Please add a option to automatically download songs that are in the library. Thank You
13249,Apple Music,Thabo Sambo,4,1,"Perfect sound quality and great app overall, my only issue is the notification panel that always seems to stay black regardless of the application being a different colour (white). In this day and age it's quite distracting and ugly to look at as it stands out from the rest of the application. Please bland in the notification panel so that it matches the app or just provide an option that hides the panel when you enter the app that way it's out of sight."
13250,Apple Music,Akshat Sinha,1,6,The app keeps crashing all the time in android. It is not able to connect with my apple id to confirm my subscription type and so it keeps on asking for verifications of some sort. Please check and rectify this bug. I am not able to use the app because of this bug.
13251,Apple Music,Jo√£o Nuno Duarte,1,4,"This app is only bugging. It's so, but so bad. The ""For you"" section and algorithm isn't even accurate with what you listen. If you want to listen to some music, ""well hello, I'm apple music and I'm going to crash/not work riiiight now""..."
13252,Apple Music,blvck,1,13,"Canceling my subscription after a year of annoying bugs and poor development. I lost all my downloaded songs again, had to re-download them again for third time in a year. There's isn't an option to download all of them, you have to create a special Playlist with all of your songs (in iTunes) to do it. After a year of different problems happening constantly I'm switching to Spotify, and seeing the other reviews, I'm not the only one. You guys are losing money because of poor management."
13253,Apple Music,Amarachi Nwauwa,1,1,"No matter what I do, my payment methods aren't accepted. Not even my Barter card is accepted ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Please tell me how I can fix this. I know this could potentially be a great app, I'm just terribly disappointed amd frustrated by it right now."
13254,Apple Music,Œ±—èvŒπŒ∑—Ç–Ω,1,1,I'd give a zero stars if it was possible. For a firm with such reputation to make an app so buggy is unbelievable. If this is what Apple quality feels like then am amazed as to how in the hell they're so damn popular. Shittiest music streaming app in the play store.
13255,Apple Music,Steven Heiting,3,3,"it was awesome until the last update. now the app freezes roughly every 2 minutes, skips like its a CD, and lags like its a comouter from the 80s. These issues are on a brand new Galazy S10+ with downloaded music from the apple music cloud. so its the app, not the phone or cell service. PLEASE FIX THIS. ANDROID CUSTOMERS MATTER TOO."
13256,Apple Music,Phil Haffenden,2,0,"I had an iPhone for a number of years and eventually changed to a Samsung Galaxy A5. I was pleasantly surprised that the Apple music worked really well. move on some months and I upgraded to a Samsung Galaxy S10, I had not reservations as the app worked so well on my previous phone. I was so disappointed that the app suddenly stops. I updated the software but still find the phone app stops. please please sort this glitch out. I have used other music apps and have no problems."
13257,Apple Music,A Google user,1,16,Wish I could give less than one star. Every version has been buggy over the last two years. Now I cant even play music since the latest update. I pay for streaming but I cant play a single song. I am done with the worst app I have ever used.
13258,Apple Music,adam perez,1,4,"So how long am I gonna have to keep looking at a white screen every time I open this app? If I wanna look at a white screen, I might as well cancel this subscription and just look at my walls. Come on already. Get this fixed!!!"
13259,Apple Music,Tyler Arnhold,1,12,"I love Apple Music. I've used it for over a year now. I opened the app today, and it said it couldnt connect to my library. I updated the app, and it shows the names of my songs with no artwork and wont play anything. So now I dont know what to do."
13260,Apple Music,Harry Bird,1,1,"After recent update the app consistently stutters while playing music. Crashes frequently or simply decides to pause what's currently playing. ""Downloaded"" songs often do not play if I have no internet connection. This is on a Galaxy S8 if that makes any difference at all."
13261,Apple Music,Tarun Shukla,3,2,There is a problem which is not getting fixed even after updates. The problem of some songs not getting downloaded on the device. Even on LTE network or on WiFi. It took so many updates not to fix this ????? common apple use some engineers here..
13262,Apple Music,Ryan Mitchell,1,3,"Can't even use the app anymore. The screen just goes white and stays white. Sometimes it won't even open, or lags tremendously when you tap on the apps icon. This only began to occur around the same time as the 26th of March update."
13263,Apple Music,Moon Kuen Mak,1,26,Bluetooth keeps dropping: I am using S8+ with a pair of Jabra Elite 65t. Am I the only one experiencing frequent Bluetooth connection drops? I have the same issue with another Bluetooth device while also seeing some lagging / freezing issues with this Apple Music apps. I know of conclude the Bluetooth issue is generated by this Apps.
13264,Apple Music,Falu Mapara,2,1,"My music while playing over Bluetooth or even just from my phone skips a couple seconds in the middle of songs. I've restarted my phone, uninstalled apple music, then reinstalled it. As well as when i skip songs.. it wont automatically play where as before it used to. Im paying however much it is for apple music and im not gwtting top quality.. might switch to Spotify."
13265,Apple Music,A Google user,1,148,"Your prices have risen and your quality has dropped, and after taking almost a week to remedy a situation, nah I'll bring my money to YouTube Music. They're downloads actually work, they're cheaper, and they actually can find you good new music..."
13266,Apple Music,Eduardo Huamani,1,7,"The last update fixed almost all issues I had, however there's a problem when I try to select a song on different playlists, I select one and plays another one. It's annoying..."
13267,Apple Music,Luke Skywalker,3,4,"the app has improved a lot since it first came to android but there are still problems. I recently switched back to android from iPhone and I'm invested in the apple ecosystem so I need apple music. With that being said the app is less than enjoyable it constantly crashes, it's slow, and when I put an album into my play later or up next it plays the whole album and not just the songs that I added to my library like it should. This app needs work I cannot reccomend it at it's current state."
13268,Apple Music,Wesley Cavinder,2,3,"I absolutely love Apple Music, but every once in awhile, it deletes all of my songs! I probably have over 500 songs and now I have to go tap on them manually to add them back! This is the third time it has happened to me and in pissed."
13269,Apple Music,Moin Khan,3,2,"I really like Apple Music! But, the fact that my android is not considered a trusted device, I am stuck! I can no longer add a family member without actually owning an apple device. Pretty sure its a bud in the app. Please correct it Asap! üôè"
13270,Apple Music,Kosiso Ngini,1,2,This app keeps bugging. it bugged so much i couldn't play any song. then I uninstalled amd installed again and it started showing me the previous account i was using. Now I'm trying to log out and it's telling me I'm not connected to the internet when I clearly am. please fox this app
13271,Apple Music,Claudia G,1,3,issues on galacy s9: app used to let me stream my paid subscription seamlessly on any Bluetooth device. now it stops randomly and i look at the screen and its not disconnected from the device becuse the song time is still going but the sound disappears. i constantly have to press play to keep listening and it's inconvenient.i thought it was my headphones bit it happens on anythingim connected to via bluetooth or not. please fix this as its not worth my subscription if i cant listen to my music.
13272,Apple Music,Luke Karam,2,0,Buggy as hell. Seriously?? I have a flagship android device and this is a paid service yet the app can barely run. Apple is literally a trillion dollar company. Please tell me why Downloaded songs need to buffer or why my songs just randomly pause. Not to mention the last update forced me to redownload all my songs which took me forever because you have no choice but to do it individually. Not impressed
13273,Apple Music,James Galt,1,0,"The appleID signup was too difficult to complete from my phone. the app doesn't save your place while retrieving the verification email, forcing the user to restart the damn thing. i did that several times and have since decided it's best to forget about Apple's music service. I didn't have this much trouble getting my Amazon Music (or any others ive tried like Pandora, youtube, etc) accounts going. Your loss Apple!"
13274,Apple Music,Nicola Gilmore,1,4,"Same problem as everyone else. Had no problems until now .spent last 3 hours on phone with apple support, they say they were not aware of it .Technical looking into it. Not paying ¬£10 a month for a black screen !!!"
13275,Apple Music,Emma Carroll,1,0,"lots of we encountered an issues and no access to music, videos and films I own. limited to apple music pass is a joke. i have spent tons on music, atleast let have access to it. otherwise I may as well just use spotify same price, looks better, never crashes, syncs with computer. this doesn't. long way to go if you want to compete and win back my subscription cant afford to subscribe to both. Samsung galaxy s10+"
13276,Apple Music,Mel O,5,0,"I loved the app setup of Amazon music, but my music kept getting deleted for no reason and there were certain albums that werent available that i wanted. Spotify, Tidal, and Deezer have pretty much all the availability but the same type of setup, which severely impacts how I like to manage my music. I tried to avoid jumping on the Apple bandwagon, but now I can't resist. ALL music is in reach with perfect organization and mangement in the app. Thank you Apple and please don't change your app!"
13277,Apple Music,Sam Cox,1,14,It's completely broken... was working absolutely flawless until the latest update and now it just stays on a white screen and does nothing. May as well cancel my apple music subscription. Just a waste of money if I cannot use it!
13278,Apple Music,Ashley Trogdon,1,3,"App is unusable since the latest update, which is unacceptable when you're paying for a service. I've emailed support and gotten no response back. I guess as long as they're getting paid, actually having the app work doesn't matter."
13279,Apple Music,Obonye Kush,1,7,"This app was amazing when I first started using it, Now I can't even download or play new music without a pop up for my sign in despite being logged into my account, and then it still doesn't get to play the song or download. please help!"
13280,Apple Music,J Jay,2,5,the app was good until I did the update. now it's just a white screen. I'm paying for a white screen. Apple or whomever needs to fix this problem and credit us for the time lost. The update is the worse thing I could have done.
13281,Apple Music,Christopher Austin,1,1,Keeps crashing on my one device. I got a new phone and apparently it must not be compatible (Samsung Galaxy J3).... sucks! Thinking it might be time to make the jump to Spotify even though I really don't want to make that change.
13282,Apple Music,JD Laze,1,0,Be 5 stars and would switch from play music but missing 3 big features that most music players and even iPhones have! 1. Can't listen to local music files I have on SD card. You can on iPhone? 2. there is no shuffle or repeat icon in the now playing area. Your forced to play songs in order. Does have a shuffle option in the Playlist or library area but that's it. 3. Also what about seeing what comes next on the current shuffle list? Like on iPhone? Scroll through list of to be played songs
13283,Apple Music,Ani B,1,1,"honestly i dont know what is happening with apple music, but i am getting really tired of this! i am just going to cancel my subscription. everyday for the past few week it shuts down or no responsive. what am i paying for? i done."
13284,Apple Music,Ms Johnson,1,1,What is going on? Stopped playing mid song and now won't play any songs at all for the last 8 hours.. Tried to update and it still isn't playing.. This is ridiculous for the amount of money I pay monthly.. This needs to be fixed ASAP
13285,Apple Music,And Rej,1,2,"Just can't make it work, after every update I give it another try, but so far couldn't even start the app. I give up, the app is rubbish. Was it made on purpose for Android users or on iOS os works the same way? :)"
13286,Apple Music,Mike Jordan,1,2,says I'm logged in but won't load my library right wants me to log back in everytime I want to play a song so like I'm gonna call and cancel my subscription I switched phones and had a hell of time trying to get it to work said my phone subscription wasn't working with my phone number be apple you take my money every month that didn't happen last time I switched phones android user.
13287,Apple Music,Lisa Karlin,1,37,"Well you guys are close but your update to your update still doesnt work. Wont let me login. Any chance you can rollback to a version that works, while you debug your issue? I'd expect Apple to have a better sw release process."
13288,Apple Music,anshul kumar,1,0,"app has been quite buggy after the 2.8.1 update fix.I had over 5 gb songs added to my library and now it says you don't have any downloads ,so I had to download them again but wait after reopening the app they are again not there !! I really liked this app before the march 29th fix ,but now it is quite disappointing to see that the company has still not resolved the isuse(that too for a premium service)."
13289,Apple Music,Lauren Haberman,1,6,"Dont think I'll use it past my free trial. can't auto download music which is a pain with 1500 songs. Also, not sure what's going on but I'm trying to play music right now and it won't even try to play a song when I click on it"
13290,Apple Music,Megan Markison,3,1,The app was going good for a while but now it doesnt play when my 4g is working and it cuts off randomly and stops playing music. I really hope the developers can fix this problem because apple music has a great selection of artists. Please please fix!
13291,Apple Music,Tabitha,1,1,Doesn't start up or does so very slowly. Took me four tries before I was actually able to log in. Then it kept saying that it couldn't connect to the server. This didn't happen on my iPhone... Nevermind then üôÑ Deleted it immediately
13292,Apple Music,Donovan Jackson,1,1,Music will stop either in the end or somewhere in the middle and i have to go in the app to skip or restart the song. Also there is random skipping even when on a good wifi or data signal. Been going on for the past 2 weeks or so.
13293,Apple Music,Chindenine,1,7,"Actual garbage. I can only access my music that i pay $10 a month for on a good day without getting ""loading music library.."" or ""can't connect to Apple Music"" even when my songs are downloaded. Just trash. Swap to Spotify."
13294,Apple Music,Juliet Appiah-nyanta,1,6,Crashes non stop. for the last couple of days the app just randomly stops playing and you have to go into the app to start playing a song again. this happens every 10 to 15 mins. come on apple I need my music fix without sudden silence...you are making me pay attention to the world around me!!!
13295,Apple Music,Delisha Gordon-Brown,1,1,"Crashes way too often. it worked fine for so long, many years, but now theboast several weeks it crashes aaaallll the time!!! seriously like aaaaallllll the time! every few minutes. its so annoying that i pay for this app but dont get full service in return."
13296,Apple Music,Jarod Richelhof,1,3,"After the recent update, the app doesn't work at all. I get a blank white screen and the app closes. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling, still nothing. Please fix, used to be pretty good, now, not so much..."
13297,Apple Music,Christy-Jo de Lange,1,3,"App is not user friendly for andriod and I struggle constantly just to get my app working, I thought if I update my app it will work but its just worst now!! I can't seem to find any customer service email or contact numbers in order for me to get this problom fixed"
13298,Apple Music,Jessie Williams,1,3,after update the app is constantly trying to connect to library and keeps stopping music/shutting the app off when trying to create and edit playlists. It also won't save download music and does not play music through wi-fi (nothing erong with my wifi as problems only occur with apple music)
13299,Apple Music,Gagik Ghazaryan,1,20,keeps crashing.... what the hell apple? is android just too sophisticated of an os for you ??? over and over you keep destroying all the good faith you had built with me as an extremely loyal customer. step your game up ü§Øyou're turning in to windows vista....
13300,Apple Music,Val Isch,1,3,It doesn't even let me create an account because the app doesn't recognize the verification codes Apple sends me. I gave up after five tries. This app is garbage. I'll continue using Spotify. Uninstalled and banned from memory.
13301,Apple Music,Raghav Athreya,1,1,The app has crashed. i am a subscriber to it ..i also recently made payment. The music is not playing when i click on it. i am using android to play music in apple music app. Nothing is working now. This is Sad.
13302,Apple Music,Kyle La Jeunesse,5,16,"Very happy with Apple Music! I have been able to find every single song I've ever searched for. It's amazing how huge the library of music is. I do have an iPhone, but an Android tablet. It's great that they added Apple Music for non-Apple products. Kudos!"
13303,Apple Music,Seth Chapman,2,0,"apple music used to be great, now not so much. app frequently crashes and I almost never can play music off of data as the albums never want to load. I've even had times where I cant play music that's downloaded on my phone. super frustrating as I can go stream the song off YouTube faster than I can get a song to load on the app. Yall better fix your app otherwise I'm dropping my subscription."
13304,Apple Music,Scott Atwood,2,1,Apple needs to fix a bug. Playback stops intermittently. I cannot get thru more than 2 songs before playback stops. It is an app issue because Play Music app works just fine. It worked great up to a couple months ago.
13305,Apple Music,Nezzie,2,0,"Annoyed I have been using this app for quite a number of years. lately ?new update, it just continues to crash on my Note9. Yes, I have used it on previous notes and iphones with no issues. I'm playing a song and it'll just stop. Love this app, just annoying it continues to crash."
13306,Apple Music,Daniel Devenney,1,0,constant stopping in the middle of a song. Stops playing the song mid way through and then just continues on a blank space for oblivion (it once was on 3+ hours for the same song when the song was less than 2 minutes). Whole app is scuffed. Paying for the worst subscription service ever. Good job Apple for breaking the app.
13307,Apple Music,Aaron Lane,1,0,"Can't even get logged in. Went through the process several times. I get to the accept terms and conditions page, and accept, and it doesn't do anything. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling and it's the same thing every time. You wouldn't think they would put the Apple name on an app like this. it's a shame."
13308,Apple Music,UBONGABASI EKANEM,1,1,your app is whack. imagine that i have been trying to subscribe for a whole month now n all it does is to get to the point where it sents me a verification code via my email. but after i input the code it tells me that u've run into some problems. its so disgusting
13309,Apple Music,Haren Rodriguez,1,2,I'm starting to think Samsung is sabotaging this app. it works totally fine on my iPhone. I use it on my Samsung as it is the phone I work out with.. however for the past few weeks its constantly crashing. fix this asap!!
13310,Apple Music,Taylor Oldham,1,2,The app was working great until a recent update and now my music will just stop randomly. When I then go into the app to start the music again it crashes. We need a fix because I pay for iTunes now and it's simply not working.
13311,Apple Music,Nick Rose,3,0,"Just switched to Samsung after being with Apple for years so all my music is on Apple Music and tried using it on my Samsung Note 9, but can't really use it because the app is constantly glitching out and crashing and I really hope this gets fixed soon because I can't stand using spotify after using apple music for so long. Apple music is definitely my favourite way to find music. Only reason I chose 3 stars is because the app crashes, but besides that I love it and will always be the best."
13312,Apple Music,Jagmeet Singh,1,1,"I cannot download the music on Android Pie. Please fix this issue. I've reinstalled the app and signed in again but nothing worked. The songs do not play since I've updated to Android Pie, and app stopped responding and started crashing."
13313,Apple Music,Robert M. Errera,4,4,"The UI and animations are nice but you cant queue up downloads for later and there is no way to use Chromecast or AirPlay (but you can tell Google Assistant to play something ""on Apple Music"" even though you can't set it as your default music app with Assistant). it's nice to be able to add an album to your library before it releases, though."
13314,Apple Music,Tola Olabode,1,1,I have a Samsung galaxy S8+ and the app keeps crashing every minute. I've had it for a while and it was working perfectly fine till I updated it. Fix it soon. it's annoying when your music stops every minute.
13315,Apple Music,Alex MacNeil,1,5,"App keeps going to random songs and restarting some songs. Does not play songs when tapped. Does not curently work with Android auto. This issue was fixed, but then the app promptly stopped working. I cannot play any music now."
13316,Apple Music,kena J,3,0,"Lately the app has been crashing, sometimes when I click on a song to play it won't play it and I have to force the app closed, then during these last few days it deleted all of my songs that were saved for offline listening. After I redownloaded all of them the next day it did the same thing..."
13317,Apple Music,Dor Anca,1,2,suddenly app stoped starting from Android auto. it says app is not currently running. then only if i pick up the phone while driving... and open Apple music manually... it starts playing from Android auto as well. please fix this or i will stop being a paying customer.
13318,Apple Music,Julie Roberts,1,3,Canceling subscriptions to this app. It used to fabulous. But I will be painfully transferring all my music to Amazon music app. Never plays my music and sits on buffering all the time. Garbage and not worth the money anymore.
13319,Apple Music,Jayashree Coutinho,1,2,"I have been trying to cancel my subscription for ages but the ""Manage Membership"" feature goes to a blank page. You're literally stealing my money from me every month. Absolutely awful experience."
13320,Apple Music,Travis Bjorkander,1,1,"Frequent Crashes and very unstable after 3/29 update. it also stopped working with Android Auto, which is the main reason I got the subscription and app. Please roll out a fix for the crashes and android auto, was working fine before most recent update."
13321,Apple Music,paola heras,2,2,"I switched from iPhones to galaxy and was happy to know I can bring my apple music with me, but the quality has been poor when I connect it in my car. while the song plays it will suddenly stops or disrupt. please look into this"
13322,Apple Music,Paul Wolstenholme,1,0,This app had been wonderful. Had. It was better than Spotify and Deezer. But then started having glitches where songs would skip like an old scratched cd from your car glovebox or even randomly stop playing. Hugely frustrating. So I uninstalled the app to try reinstall but now can't log in as my subscription cannot be found. Thanks Apple üëèüñï faced with starting a new subscription or more likely going elsewhere after building a large library.
13323,Apple Music,Connor Luckett,1,0,was fine until now I'm not going to bac mouth apple. their service is the best by a long shot. But for the past week the api must be not functioning properly because nothing loads. i cant even sign in again now that i tried a reinstall. I'm frustrated I'm paying for a service which i cannot use.
13324,Apple Music,–î–º–∏—Ç—Ä–∏–π –ì–æ–Ω—á–∞—Ä–µ–Ω–∫–æ,1,1,"It always been buggy, but now all my downloaded music just disappeared. It still takes 3.5 GB of space. I can move all of my 415 tracks between SD and internal storage. But in playlist I need to download all music to listen it offline"
13325,Apple Music,Aviroop Datta,2,0,"My album art isn't downloading properly since the time I switched from iOS to android. It either comes blank or distorted incomplete pictures. Also when I connect to my car Bluetooth audio, it suddenly just stops playing. I then need to start it again from my phone. It crashes a even when listening to music on earphones! Can't see see the situation getting better. Almost tempted to shift to Spotify now."
13326,Apple Music,Emma Hansen,1,33,"Please please fix this! after the last update, it stopped working. Just a plain white screen when I open it now. Y'all done messed up. Back to using other music streaming services."
13327,Apple Music,Karthik N D,1,14,"Why is the app not working? This seems extremely unprofessional. Fix it, for god's sake. You are now witnessing the reasons for Apple's losing battle against... pretty much everything else."
13328,Apple Music,Ben Jones,1,0,"worst android app I've ever used. I'm sure that's done intentionally but wow, they've set the bar high. Wouldn't let me sign into my apple ID, had to create a new one. now my songs won't download and I'm running at a 450mgb download speed. Nice job, Apple!!!"
13329,Apple Music,Adrian Armstrong,3,0,"Music automatically pausing, app continuously crashing when skipping through tracks are just two of the many issues with this app. Seems to be ever since I got the S10 and the app is failing to keep up to date with it, which is a complete joke considering you pay good money per month for it."
13330,Apple Music,Laura J,1,0,"I get free apple music with Verizon. I have tried for three days to get past the 15 screens of user agreement and no matter how many times I agree, it never lets me past the agreement. even tried agreeing for every page. free nothing is still nothing. I stick with Amazon Prime Music."
13331,Apple Music,A Google user,1,4,"Just subscribed and cannot access my ""For You"" in the app. All I get is an error message telling me that something went wrong and that there looks like theres a problem with the network. Have tried uninstalling and reinstalling but nothing works. Not a good start to my membership with Apple!"
13332,Apple Music,Karrie Pawloski,1,9,"Doesn't work on my S9. Before the update, it would stop playing every 4 or 5 songs. After the most recent update, songs stop playing randomly - right in the middle of the song."
13333,Apple Music,Starmade Productions,1,4,Did you guys get rid of the equalizer???? *update 1 month later* still no equalizer and now the app crashes so often and barely even loads my library. Why do you guys make the app worse continuously after each update???
13334,Apple Music,Skylar Brown,2,0,The app is constantly crashing. Sometimes it stops responding and has to be forced closed. Since the last update it randomly stops in the middle of the song and I have to manually skip to the next song. This is really annoying especially when you're driving trying to vibe out!!!
13335,Apple Music,Kate C,2,1,"would love to continue using the app, since i like the familiar apple interface and the music selection, but it keeps crashing. deleted all of my downloaded music randomly after one of the crashes.... just not worth it anymore"
13336,Apple Music,c,1,5,"almost all of my music library is unplayable because its ""not available in your region"" when it wasnt say that just a couple days ago. Apple music sucks. You're better off with spotify"
13337,Apple Music,Anand Chandra,1,82,something wrong after the last 2 updates.. its not working anymore.. just a white screen.. the moment we pull up the app... i have already reinstalled the app.. cleared all the cache.. and the temp files.. but the problem still persists. Please fix
13338,Apple Music,Josh Britten,1,3,"Had deezer and Google music previously and both a million times better. This app on a Samsung Galaxy S8 isn't for for purpose. It constantly crashes, music keeps skipping despite excellent wifi speed, randomly stops. Poor poor overall performance. Another awful Apple product."
13339,Apple Music,Wanda Brown,1,3,lost my account due to someone changing the phone number on the account and there was not a darn thing you could do to get it back! you had my credit card my name my email address my Apple ID but because that number was changed nothing i could do. y'all need to come up with a better way for people that get hacked can get their account back. the way you have it now tge hacker wins
13340,Apple Music,Carlos Cabrera,1,16,App still crashes! A song doesn't even play after a few skips. This is so frustrating. I'm seriously considering switching over to Spotify and paying for their service instead.
13341,Apple Music,caleb lopez,1,1,"idk why I've payed for this for years now. It has had bugs since the beginning and now is rendering useless. I cannot listen to 5 minutes of music with out it stopping playing, then I must restart application."
13342,Apple Music,Arianna Kennedy,1,0,Keeps saying there's something wrong with my billing info but I get charged every month. Also NOTHING will play even though money was just debited from my account. I've been using this app since it came out and I've never had this problem. This app seriously needs an update.
13343,Apple Music,Michael Conboy,1,1,since last update songs will just stop playing sound yet the time is still going??? if you forget about it itll keep going up to 1+ hours?? sort it out iTunes I pay ¬£15 a month to listen to music and lately barely can!!!
13344,Apple Music,Jeff Brown II,3,0,"Apple Music on android randomly plays the music im listening too silent, so the music is playing, i see the time moving but there is no sound. I have to restart my phone in order for it to work again... frustrating af. Im probably going to change streaming services. Otherwise the app is great."
13345,Apple Music,Christopher Lieb,1,3,Apple Music on my iPhone was awesome. On my Samsung... not so much. Not sure why apple knowingly releases a crappier product for non iPhone users as it's still a revenue stream... oh well. guess I'll have to switch over to spotify
13346,Apple Music,Sherlock Seazer Holmes,1,2,Alphabetical sort isn't work. Every letter replace the other for example letter is A but above song names starting with b. I sent an email to them. But there was no answer. It's time to return spotify.
13347,Apple Music,Marwieyah Samsodien,1,2,just cancelled my subscription cause I can't deal with the app not working everytime. Either it will say the app isn't responding and just recently the app decided to not play any music. So bye bye apple music. was nice knowing you
13348,Apple Music,Matthew Jones,1,2,latest update terrible. i thought my bluetooth headphones were the source of my problems with music cutting in and out. apparently not as this still happens using wired headphones. no issues on spotify or streaming youtube. really unhappy as i pay top $ for family subscription
13349,Apple Music,Xavier Giroux-Bougard,1,2,"Doesn't allow me to download music for offline playback... customer support said it was because I only have internal storage, no SD card, which is the silliest thing I've ever heard. Then they changed their tune and said it was a problem only with Android 9's download manager, and because it works okay on Android 8, they redirected me to Android customer support ü§£. Sounds like some Apple devs haven't done their homework. Uninstall."
13350,Apple Music,JOSHUA COMPTON,1,0,"ever since last update on 3/29/19 nothing but crashing, ever since the last update the app does nothing but crash and not load my songs and if I pause in the middle of a playlist or album it restarts from the beginning not the song i was on edit: I will say prior to last update this was the best service for music, hopefully the have a update soon to fix the issues"
13351,Apple Music,Josh Rocha,3,0,"I've used this app across all major brands, iPhone, Samsung, and LG. My top complaint is that there is no download all music button. I change phones frequently and it's annoying having to push download on every track over 500 times. Why not add this feature?"
13352,Apple Music,ben veasey,1,3,"ive always liked the app, but since downloading on my Huawei it doesnt play music ü§® i can download the songs but it won't play them. hoping for a simple fix. would always put this app as a 5 star on previous phones."
13353,Apple Music,Alexandrea Cini,1,0,I shouldn't have to put my new credit card information in just to access my account of music I've already paid for in the past. I've had my card compromised by apple before and thats the reason I removed it before. Not happening. Uninstalling and going elsewhere.
13354,Apple Music,Chris Rivera,1,3,After the newest update i am completely unable to use apple music. Its constantly on a white screen. I restarted my phone several times and uninstalled/reinstalled the app twice. The same issue occured. Its horrible because im being charged monthly and be unable to use the app for about 4 days and counting. Please fix this issue.
13355,Apple Music,Brandon Scott,1,1,"All of a sudden, the music skips while its playing. Been doing it for about 2 weeks now. Long story short, I pay monthly for this app, fix this because it's no reason it should have any issues."
13356,Apple Music,ashesvstheworld,1,1,"there are some songs that say they have been added to my music library, but when I go to check it isn't there. I've uninstalled and restarted my device and the issue persists. this is so annoying"
13357,Apple Music,Gen,1,2,This app won't even let me log into my account. It keeps telling me the username and password are wrong even though I can sign into my account on other devices. Completely useless app!
13358,Apple Music,Marshel Etheridge,1,39,"Review 2. After a recent update this week, the app doesn't even load any more. All I get is a solid white or black screen that freezes my phones until the app finally crashes."
13359,Apple Music,jarden shafik,1,0,"keeps crushing and i cant play offline downloaded music without an Internet connection. this app had me prepare my downloads, showed me that my music was downloaded on the phone only to gwt on the plane to not be able to access any off that music but the funny part was that it showed me that the music was downloaded until i had go connect to the internet for me to be able to start playing that downloaded music. scale 1-10 its a 3 from my end and keep in mind ive been using Apple music for 2 years"
13360,Apple Music,Jewell Huse-Galvan,1,1,"The new update is wack. Can only view ""downloaded"" music, even on WIFI & data. Deleted my playlists, and app crashes nearly everytime you open it. Fix your garbage, Apple. This is why everyone switches to Samsung."
13361,Apple Music,Sri Harsha Maddila,2,4,"Absolutely disgusting Android user experience lets down a decent music collection. Decent because it doesn't have explicit versions of many songs and a few albums are missing themselves. If only the UX can be made as smooth as on iOS devices, I'd be much happier with the app. Once Spotify settles it's dispute with Warner, I'm jumping ship."
13362,Apple Music,Dean De Sousa,2,4,"App won't let me access any of my playlists, as i enter playlists it bugs out and returns to home screen. Have to search for the playlist in order to access them. only started happening recently."
13363,Apple Music,Neil Rutter,1,5,worked great! my go to music app. but now it has become a white screen. nothing to see. nothing to play. uninstalling and reinstalling doesn't work. please fix.
13364,Apple Music,A Google user,3,0,"Its pretty terrible, it crashes when trying to add music to a playlist, songs wont save so you cant play them offline, songs sometimes dont even load and if your account is american and you dont live in America it spams you with a notifaction telling you that you may only purchase music from america, i gave it 3 since you can find just about every song but sound cloud is a better functioning app, plus I know apple isnt going to fix anything cause its apple."
13365,Apple Music,A Google user,1,4,Apple Music deleted all my music that I had downloaded. Every single one! Not impressed. It has taken months to download all the music I actually can access in my country.
13366,Apple Music,Peter Doczi,1,0,"so I've updated the app that was supposed to fix random shut downs. since the update my 20 gigabyte downloaded music was deleted, the app crashes at least a dozen times a day and the playback of downloaded songs are not smooth either. I want my money back!"
13367,Apple Music,Cristina Alcaraz,1,3,"Apple App keeps crashing... ongoing issue for the past week!! Please fix ASAP! if it were actually working, I would give the app 5 stars but as of now it doesn't even deserve 1 star"
13368,Apple Music,Joy Madison,1,0,"I don't understand why they offer this in the play store since it doesn't work even half as well as it does on Apple products. The app glitches 3-4 times a week and only gets updated once every few mo. Save your download, use a more compatible service."
13369,Apple Music,Virginia D,2,1,"was working great . I mostly use in my car. lately app has been non-stop closing . But now after my note 8 did a update , somgs stop palying after 1 minute. i cant figure it out if its in settings or what . please update"

13374,Apple Music,Jeh Shroff,2,3,"the only reason im even rating this high is because it has mist of thr music i like. The thing is, the app crashes every 3 days. and no matter how many times i edit the display pic of my playlist, it refuses to update it and the default album cover remains. the recommendations are horrible it keeps recommending pop to me, even though thr majority of music i listen to is metal and rock ."
13375,Apple Music,Isaac Davis,1,0,"Apple Music is a fail.

13381,Apple Music,Victoria Seanoa,1,0,"this app SUCKS and its SO FRUSTRATING because it sucks for EVERYONE. Yet the developers refuse to take responsibility, fix the issues we're demanding to be fixed, and wont even respond to our complaints and reviews.

13382,Apple Music,Erin Caskey,2,0,"Yesterday when I opened Apple Music I started getting a white screen. I restarted my phone, uninstalled the app reinstalled it and same thing! I was hoping that it might have fixed itself today but nope! I pay for the service so very frustrated and annoyed üò°."

13385,Apple Music,Stephen Bogenschutz,2,0,(Samsung phone) my Verizon package offers unlimited version of this app. If it weren't for that then I'd stick with Amazon music. This app stutters constantly and closing app and restarting phone doesn't help at all. Has a large library of songs to choose from though
13386,Apple Music,Sumit Mandley,4,0,"Please add the feature to directly use 'play next' button from the current playing queue. Dragging songs from the queue to the top is very inconvenient and uneasy, adding the feature to play next within the queue would help a lot. Otherwise a great music service."
13387,Apple Music,Dustin Borden,2,0,"very slow interface. terrible app. very disappointed. very slow to respond, sometume takes minutes to play a song after its been selected. ive even had times when ive selected a song and it will not play, only to play minutes after ive already slected a different song. needs a lot of work."
13388,Apple Music,YoungM,2,6,"It no longer deletes my downloaded music all of the sudden but it's really slow, like really really slow, specially when navigating an album, it's completely infuriating comparing it to Spotify and SoundCloud"

I reopened the app to continue playback like I always did. And lo and behold my entire downloaded songs were gone. Truth be told I'm infuriated right now, this happening under 1 month of my trial usage has got me thinking if I really want to pay for such crappy service. What's the point of downloading when it can just be wiped off on a whim."

13400,Apple Music,Jonathan Harrell,1,0,"DO NOT USE THIS APP ON ANDROID! constantly crashes and deletes all downloaded music on your phone, eats up your data when it changes songs, and playback is choppy and stutters. Using latest version in March 2019. app crashed and deleted my whole library i had downloaded on the night prior."
13401,Apple Music,Ramanuja Mangla,2,2,Unpredictable product. Sometimes works smoothly and you start building trust with it. Just then it starts crashing and getting stuck and then you recall why you gave it just 2 stars...
13402,Apple Music,Coral Eliza,1,1,"latest update ruined this for me. I pay monthly for this app and now it constantly crashes, stops playing music especially while driving. it would be great if these bugs were fixed"

13404,Apple Music,Aahtue A,4,0,"Better than the many streaming services I've experienced. I do wish Apple Music would incorporate album credits in with the albums/music. Album/Song credits are a very important part of the musical experience thats left out, and I hope Apple will change that."

13408,Apple Music,Jessica Beauvais,2,3,"i used the app to listen to some specific music , and then I didnt use the app for about a month, went back to use it, and the playlist I had created was gone."
13409,Apple Music,andrew williams,2,11,It would be better if it gave you a playlist of songs that you listen to and new releases. I'm in two minds to moving over to Spotify I think apple need to put a bit of money into there music app as it's getting left behind.
13410,Apple Music,Ajay Cox,2,0,"On my previous Galaxy devices, this app worked perfectly. I recently upgraded to the Galaxy s10 and the app continues to crash or won't play music.

13411,Apple Music,Sunny Guha,1,2,"if a android user can't use your app, he/she needs to have a iphone/apple id, then why you made this app for android and upload it in playstore? do you guys have shortage of common sense? idk!"
13412,Apple Music,Psycho_ 2004,4,1,"The app is pretty good, the only problem is that i have to pay for this service when spotify does it for free, i also experience bugs where it will crash the app."
13413,Apple Music,Affan Ahmad,1,9,"easily thr worst of the streaming services on android at least. The app is buggy, lags when scrolling, force closes, etc. I havent had this problem with spotify or GPM. Now, the app straight up wont launch, just a white screen. Time to switch to spotify."
13414,Apple Music,Thomas M Barsody,1,1,I was a lifelong member of apple music (android) but recently I kept trying to access my Apple music and all it showed was a white blank screen. It also said the apple music app was not able to load and is unavailable. This is unacceptable and I am currently trying to cancel my subscription with apple(which is a pain in the ass by the way) and go to spotfi. Apple is dead to me.
13415,Apple Music,Kristen Moon,3,0,"I miss the ability to stream music offline. I used to be able to download a playlist and listen to it with no streaming difficulty, now it stops and sends a message that I must connect to the internet to listen to my downloaded playlist."
13416,Apple Music,Kevin du Preez,1,1,"There is no support for andriod users, the app crashes, the songs stop randomly even if they're downloaded and it's a waste of time and money, such a frustrating app."
13417,Apple Music,Charley Quinn,5,78,"All the songs or albums I could access on Spotify *spits* I found on Apple Music and it works fine. Now, if only it can work with Cortana and Google Assistant THAT would be so clutch."
13418,Apple Music,Lyam Paris,1,1,So I'm to understand I can't listen to the music I've had on my itunes since before the first iPhone was even announced unless I pay to stream music that I'll never listen to? Absolute garbage service.
13419,Apple Music,To√±o Bobadilla,1,6,"Too many bugs, makes the experience horrible. Ocasionally it'll just stop playing. Then it asks me for internet connection to access DOWNLOADED playlists and won't let me edit my own playlists."
13420,Apple Music,IFcoltransG,1,4,"This is a necessary evil, because Apple hasn't decided to let you redeem gift cards on a website, like every other corporation does. But make no mistake, this is hellish. Ads and popups everywhere. And it doesn't let you manage connected accounts, even though the website says its the only way to do so on Android. It's a microcosm for Apple's priorities."
13421,Apple Music,Ehud Manzura,4,0,"There are some thing to improve, like control remotely a computer with iTunes, like Spotify do. Being Google friendly is good, but what about streaming to Chrome casts? At least it's possible to manage the family through Android, it's about a goddamn time"

Update: downloaded the new version.. works fine. thanks apple music.
13435,Apple Music,Val Noelle,3,0,"UI is clear and very easy to learn and adapt to. Sometimes the App will stop playing a song halfway, buffer on LTE and Wifi, or take a while to load (even if it is downloaded). Otherwise, love the weekly playlists."
13436,Apple Music,Rory Young,2,0,"Overall fine, but they obviously don't much care about android users, despite the losses they will suffer due to people moving to Spotify. Recently apple music no longer shows up in my notification bar/lock screen despite me not changing any settings."

13443,Apple Music,immissaya,1,0,The app doesn't auto skip or stop playing after 2 songs. The sound quality is crappy. This error makes me frustrated in the past 2 weeks. Before that Apple Music was my to-go app. Now it's the worst.
13444,Apple Music,Pankit Thakkar,1,2,"Every other app provides free song with ads. Why can't you do that too ? Yeah because you're Apple, the company that does something nobody likes."

13446,Apple Music,John Trotter,5,0,Fab! It is difficult to get used to if you if you have never used iTunes and use Android or Windows. It's worth the steep learning curve though. After loyally using Spotify for many years I'm now a convert hahaüôÑ!
13447,Apple Music,A Google user,2,4,"Not only it is slow and sometimes crashing, also the downloaded songs randomly disappear. The only thing keeps me using this is because of its better library than Spotify."

13450,Apple Music,Leianna Michalka,1,1,"So, I have to pay for a subscription to listen to music I've downloaded and paid for on my computer? It should sync without having to pay for a subscription. I'm pretty bummed. This is totally useless."
13451,Apple Music,Rena H,1,2,After the many updates I now can't play any music. It's already been a couple of days since it's been like this. I'm just going to cancel my subscription if this keeps up. Why pay for something you can't even use.

13453,Apple Music,Pastor Phillip Dailey,4,13,"Excellent app. Works almost as well as if iPhone. Sometimes it will freeze, but it's easy to restart. I only wish that the equalizer and presets worked.

13460,Apple Music,Ayabulela Fezani,1,0,"App really sucks. The worst thing is that we pay a monthly subscription fee, yet it's like I'm playing a broken record. It even pauses the song for no reason. It's like Apple doesn't give a rat's ass about non-IOS users."

13646,Apple Music,Kush Patel,4,5,"it's a great app for music, however i do face a problem of crashing for unknown reasons and it is often not so user friendly"

13649,Apple Music,Syed Nizamudeen,2,0,Chose apple music just for extensive library and offers good quality at descent price.. Android app is just horrible. I had to sign out and sign in twice just to get my library loaded..
13650,Apple Music,Makayla Logan,1,7,"UPDATE: I had to download it directly from the Apple website and I finally got it to work! Not really sure why that made a difference but I'm just happy after six months, I can finally use apple music! The application never gets passed the loading screen. I got my Galaxy S9 for Christmas and hasn't worked from day one. All of my older galaxies never had a problem with the app. I emailed them right away and still haven't heard a thing... typical. I can't believe my brother spends money on this!"

13654,Apple Music,Giovani Casanova,3,0,"Keeps crashing ever since I got Android Pie Update and won't play music unless I stay on the app, used to work fine when I had the Oreo Update. besides that no complaints."
13655,Apple Music,Alex Wargo,5,0,"even though after many many months I just only, today, and one day late, cancel my subscription to this service, I must say that it's one of the greatest music subscription services in the country is not the world and we only have a few close runner apps"

13662,Apple Music,Mick Grant,1,12,"This is the worst music app I've used. You can't even wind forward nor back within a song. It takes the battery level in my phone goes down whilst charging at one amp, and the supplied charger gives 0.8A so it's not the charge being to slow. That's Apple for you. I'm only using it for the six free months' trial with EE. After that, the app's going and the only Apple goods will ever buy will be the kind that has pips."
13663,Apple Music,A Google user,1,3,2.8.1 fixed the Android Auto issue where the songs would stop. 2.8.2 made the app unusable with Android Auto. Shouldn't have updated.
13664,Apple Music,Aaron Provines,2,1,"was okay up until about a week ago. It's always had bugs just because apple wants you to buy an apple product. Aside from the money hungry nature of apple, this app still sucks. library's load in wrong, crashes constantly, loads way too slow and skips repeatedly time after time. Fix it, just be a company and fix it. I dare you to give me one more reason to move to spotify."
13665,Apple Music,Jervazz Hammod,1,0,it won't allow me to download music and make playlist and sometimes skips songs before the song is over. the library just say something went wrong try again later since ive been paying for this service

13667,Apple Music,Ramin Azizi,1,3,i got 6 months free and believe me its rubbish compared to Spotify. the app is broken and the music suggestions and playlists are just bad.

13675,Apple Music,A Google user,2,1,"Considering leaving - when playing a play list it stops after a few tracks. I have a number of other apple products but changed to android phones for business purposes, so the fact I could still use my apple music subscription was excellent. However it feels like the app doesn't get the attention it needs by the developers. Going to start looking at Spotify and tidal"
13676,Apple Music,Anne Colangelo,1,5,you guys gonna fix the app? tried uninstalling and reinstalling but i still just get a blank white screen. completely useless
13677,Apple Music,Danielle Harvey,1,0,please sort this app out? what am I paying for? it's been jumping and skipping and pausing my songs for well over a week now!
13678,Apple Music,A Google user,1,7,App won't load anymore. You'd better fix it fast because I am a paying member!!!

13682,Apple Music,Echo gamer 1080 Stihl,4,4,everything works great on the apo but when they charge you they charge a week in advance and if you dobt have the money they shut it down until they can take the money out. Apple doesn't give any information unto when they will get the money out until you go to your app and find out on your own. so frustrating
13683,Apple Music,Alwyn Taljaard,1,2,"Was one of the best , now it stop for no reason and music sound like its constantly hitting a speed bump , cancelling my subscription"
13684,Apple Music,Elliot,1,1,"It doesn't work half the time, downloaded music doesnt load, really buggy. Switch to spotify"
13685,Apple Music,Dinesh K,2,0,Good selection of music. apart from that app crashes or stops working constantly. For someone like apple this is unacceptable.
13686,Apple Music,Cameron Kocher,2,0,"Plays one song then stops. Have to reopen, skip to next song, and restart. Performance sucks for an an app you pay 10 bucks a month for."
13687,Apple Music,Gavin Whale,2,1,I really don't the app because it is not very intuitive and is buggy. Back to Spotify after the free trial I think.
13688,Apple Music,Kevin Robertson,5,3,"edit: its working again! love Apple music on my other devices but it stopped working on my phone!

13690,Apple Music,akmal yuldashev,1,0,piece of sh** app. it won't let me create and apple I'd. total waste of time. I would give them 0 star if it was possible
13691,Apple Music,Josip Potocki,5,14,Love Apple music more than other music provider's. Apple Music does have the functionality to work with Android Auto in the car.
13692,Apple Music,Bart S,4,4,would give a 5* if it was easier to find older tunes from 60s 70s 80s for reggae & (ska needs it's own section) needs to show songs matching what you like same as YouTube does rather then having to know the songs. you can then find songs relevant to your search options
13693,Apple Music,Kai Ling Wong,1,2,the latest update rendered the app useless. i cant even launch it now!!! please fix this soon!
13694,Apple Music,Harneet Singh Pasricha,1,3,"Won't play any music. I hit play and it stops. Tried multiple times, different tracks, different albums, different artists. Nada."

13696,Apple Music,Chekuri Kesava Chaitanya Varma,4,0,Downloads are arising after every update... we are getting fear to update apple music... Apple music in android is not working properly please fix bugs and made Apple music bugs free app...
13697,Apple Music,Shrikanth Raman,1,0,This app is trash. Crashed 2 times and its not even 15 minutes since I downloaded it. Didnt expect this mediocre service from you Apple.
13698,Apple Music,V-Jay Larracas,1,0,Well played Apple. Make the Android app as unusable as possible because it's not your own OS. Spotify was right about your dirty tactics.
13699,Apple Music,Cameron Luxfero,2,118,"Apple could outperform competitors in the streaming service if the music quality was higher (lossless format). There are so many options available: ALAC, WAV, FLAC, AIFF. They may be larger than AAC, but Apple definitely has that cloud space. Not everyone cares about audio quality, so Apple could make it an option in settings. Obviously it would also take more data to stream and cost the user more, but that's not a problem if the user can download offline and has a lot of space. Give us options."
13700,Apple Music,Mark Essex,1,4,not happy. since updating the app its just a white screen. whats the point in me paying a subscription when its not working
13701,Apple Music,afriza aulia natakusuma,4,3,"*This is an edit* In the last 2 months of using the app, it has improved. Downloads are no longer stuck (most of the time), streaming a music doesn't take as long to load, and the UI has gotten smoother."
13702,Apple Music,Lukas Pig,1,10,"i do very much like this app but for some reason it no longer plays for me. everything works but when i hit play it tries and then gives up. this started outa nowhere a couple days ago. i've made sure there's enough data space and i've confirmed my phone is working fine (i have a motorola L5 if that's a factor). i'm hoping it works again someday but it looks like i may have to give up on the app, which is a shame."
13703,Apple Music,Sheifa Sheikh,1,4,I own a huawei honor 6x and I've been using apple music for about an year but it has starting creating problems like the app crashes and the songs don't play or the library keeps on loading
13704,Apple Music,Guillermo Martinez,3,0,"Terrible app, songs never want to play. It's as if Apple doesn't want to give a working app if it's not on their devices."
13705,Apple Music,Michael Silver,1,130,"I think they fixed it so now your offline music works offline, and doesn't require a connection to show what you do have. Could you fix the downloads? Nothing downloads for me; I'd gotten a new Pixel 3 a few weeks ago, so there shouldn't be any issues downloading songs, I have plenty of space. And could you make it not require me to sign in after I've already signed in?"
13706,Apple Music,A Google user,2,10,"This Ap is driving me mad! Ever since the last update, it won't allow me to download music to my phone. It tells me it's downloading but that's it! I've checked Permissions and ticked Storage. Next, I have to log out of the Ap and restart my phone. Only after all this does it allow me to download music. But wait, there's one more little surprise: it deletes my Library of previously downloaded music. After my free period ends, I'm thinking of switching services. I'm using a Samsung S9."
13707,Apple Music,SkNuwan Tissera,2,0,app dont works with calls while in Bluetooth mode. ( when connected to car ). Music is also playing while on call. Please fix.
13708,Apple Music,Sagar Kumar,1,37,"Can't download songs after the app updated! It shows it is downloading but it just never ends! This is very irritating and bad on Apple's service part. Also, the app crashes for no reason all of a sudden and then it needs to be restarted. Song begins with a little clipping sound, god knows why! When selected recently added folder, songs do not play back to back one after the other, you have to manually change it. Very annoying. Please fix all these bugs Apple!"
13709,Apple Music,Snake,1,1709,"A long time ago apple music was actually a fairly decent app to use if you just wanted to chill and listen to music. Nowadays however, you can't even access your music library. You can try every fix/suggestion possible, but you won't be able to download or listen to anything offline. Even with internet, it takes forever to buffer. You'll be better off with Spotify or Play Music if anything."
13710,Apple Music,Jesse Ortiz-Lara,1,2,"Use apple music on my iPhone and android phone. using an android is a HORRRIBLE experience. app always shuts down and has random glitches . any song that I've purchased on my iPhone will not play when I shuffle my music, it'll either skip over or stop playing my music until I skip further and press play. got a new phone hoping it was just a phone issue but issues have gotten even more consistent and annoying."
13711,Apple Music,Munees Mohammed Ali,1,4,"After the latest update, able to open the app, but im not able to play any song."
13712,Apple Music,xXStormbreakerXx,5,7,"App hasn't been working the last three days, kind of sad that there is no fix in 72 hours for a paid service and not even word of when it will be addressed. Get your stuff together Apple Edit: Resolved issue, thanks Apple!"
13713,Apple Music,Vikram Poddar,2,4,"The app sucks. Crashes too frequently, need Internet to play downloaded music most of the times."
13714,Apple Music,Leonie Mcdonald,1,2,"this app has stopped working has intalled/uninstalled and it still will not work. I am paying a monthly subscription, what have you done to the app it worked fine and now you have killed it. may look to other music subscriptions, I'm not paying for something I can't use."
13715,Apple Music,Nitish Ramanjooloo,1,14,App is no longer working on my android phone. It opens with a white screen and freezes my phone. My free service is coming to an end but now I am questioning should I continue with the subscription? Funny thing that Apple does not seem to care about fixing the issue.
13716,Apple Music,Grace Pang,1,3,New update is not letting me play any music on my google pixel. Currently paying a subscription I can't have access to..PLEASE FIX
13717,Apple Music,Blake Hoddy,1,1,Ever since new update the app continually crashes or stops half way through a song and resets back to the beginning of the playlist.
13718,Apple Music,Sheepish Gaming,1,0,"I have been using Apple for over 10 years and this update for whatever ""Apple Music"" is just Spotify Premium. Absolutley disappointed from me."
13719,Apple Music,Paul Dowlman,1,0,when you reupdated this app i was locked out & now given a new phone number to get back in my account you holding me back to get back in . so payed a month subscription without a service so 1star for bad management on your behalf
13720,Apple Music,Lalithram Rajkumar,1,17,"Is this application even made by Apple? I haven't seen a bug filled application like this in the last 4 years! I am amazed at how Apple has incredibly failed at getting a couple of good Android developers for this application. Despite constant cries for improvisation, people at Apple don't seem to be bothered about customers and their pleas. I would never recommend this application to anyone. Deeply disappointing. Looking to migrate to some other application. Any suggestions?"
13721,Apple Music,Nate Bass,2,10,Has bugs which makes for an overall bad experience. Here is one example: The playback notification keeps reappearing some time after I swipe it away. It comes back in the play position (with the pause sign showing) even though no music is playing. It would be better if the notification didn't reappear until after I went back into the app and started playing music.
13722,Apple Music,Miftahul Faridl,2,1,"I guess it's not made for Android phone, bugs here and there. My ""downloaded music"" doesn't show up so I have to reconnect it to the internet everytime I hear to them, the music isn't playing but the timer is on so it's showing the time in negative number at the end of the song, the playlist stopped at some songs while I was listening, and so on. PLEASE. FIX. IT."
13723,Apple Music,Jweeen,2,1,"Often music that is in my library, but not downloaded onto my phone, is just gone. Full albums will just stop showing up in my library and when i go to search up the albums it says it's in my library (which it's not) and the only option is to install the music. Also, the music stops playing all the time and i have to take out my phone, unlock it and start playing the music again. At first i thought it was my earbuds so i tested it on other music apps and it wasn't an issue with those apps."
13724,Apple Music,Jesus Magana,5,49,I don't know why this has a low rating but I works great on my Google Pixel 2. I'm coming from Amazon Music and that was not great at all. I was considering Spotify since they're great as well but greatly considering Apple Music over it. I'll wait til my 3 month free trial is over to decide. I'm really surprised and very happy how well it works for me so far.
13725,Apple Music,Kevin Irving,1,5,"love this streaming service, but your app is trash. I switching to Spotify until you guys get it right. the app crashes. it continues to play the same song after its end point. I would have restart app constantly. the songs stop playing right in the middle. get it to together. trillion dollar company and you can't figure out android software. that's ridiculous."
13726,Apple Music,Sheba B.,5,9,"My daughter and I absolutely love this app and use it very often being music lovers. I was so pleased to see that I was now able to get the app on my Cromebook as well. Thank you, definitely made my day. üòÅ"

13729,Apple Music,M Rogers,1,2,As of right now!! it does not work after last update!! need to fix asap!!
13730,Apple Music,Lise-Marie Eksteen,1,2,Its not working on my Android Samsang Galaxy S9+. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling it but keeps giving me a white blank screen if I open it.
13731,Apple Music,Rikki Gault,1,2,All good till last update if not fixed in next few days will be cancelling as i pay for a service i have not been receiving for nearly a week now
13732,Apple Music,Tarun Pratap,1,23,Last update just broke the app. The music does not seem to play for some of the titles and it is just annoying. Please fix it. Edit- Startups make refined apps but a behemoth like Apple can't make an app that doesn't crash all the time. There are way too many bugs in this version. Do you guys push the beta testing to the customers? Guess who is switching to Spotify soon?
13733,Apple Music,Shubham Rai,2,35,This is the shittiest production from Apple I've seen in my life. Why did you guys have to make this half-hearted attempt at making an android app. The app doesn't know what it wants to show. Things load and then the next time you come back it vanishes. There is no thumbnail caching at all. The experience is akin to using a j2me app developed by an amateur. This is hopeless
13734,Apple Music,Sean Peck,1,42,"alright. this app was working fine when I first downloaded it. having been an iPhone user for years, apple music was the streaming service I used. when I switched to a Samsung phone a few months ago, I was stoked to see apple music was available on the android platform as well. however, its reached a point now where songs I've downloaded will not play. it skips as if it were a scratched CD, stops mid song and resets itself. and frequently will just stop and. ot continue at all until I close it."
13735,Apple Music,Joel Murphy,1,1,"After cancelling my subscription, I am no longer able to access any of my music library. I spent a lot of money over the years buying albums through iTunes, and now it won't let me access any of my purchased music. The app is useless now and I've long since ditched Macbook for a Chromebook so all the songs are gone without resubscribing. The app itself was full of bugs when I did use it, so all in all, not a great experience."
13736,Apple Music,Jonathan Adda,2,1,"Love the service, but the app itself is a pain. I wiuld have given it 5 stars a couple months ago but now it randomly stops gets stuck loading songs if/when i skip to the next song while playing albums and playlists. The only thing i can do at that point is restart the app. Please fix it Apple."
13737,Apple Music,Daniel Berkovich,2,1,"many bugs. lately some covers of album are not downloading correctly, and no way to fix it."
13738,Apple Music,Last Knight72,1,1,app is broken. A white screen when app is opened snd and nothing else. Will cancel subscription and delete app.
13739,Apple Music,Sebolelo Malesa,1,1,i pay every month and this is my third time deleting and downloading apple music because it keeps deleting my downloads for offline and its starting to get annoying
13740,Apple Music,Adebayor Ayomide,3,0,"I like the display, the album arts and everything else. But the fact that my songs mysteriously disappears somehow is disturbing. I've downloaded over 3.5GB of songs and this morning all of them are gone, even the recently downloaded ones. This is not the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or even 4th time this is happening please fix this, I'm paying for this App If it can't work, let me just use my Google Play music."
13741,Apple Music,Aylin Mart√≠nez,1,0,Does not let me add the songs or even download them. Only if I am lucky can I download a song or even add it to my library and that really bothers me.
13742,Apple Music,muhammad moussa,1,0,out of nowhere music pauses.. then keeps pausing every 5 minutes... most annoying when driving. this app need alot of work for the android side...works amazing on iPhone.
13743,Apple Music,Fr4ctl _cm,5,142,"For the past 4 years, swim had used iTunes (Windows 7) with their iPod Nano 5th Gen. for which they had lived with a slightly buggy few versions for a while, although a little annoying, iTunes ""felt natural"" and so there was no obligation to choose any other service. 3 years later, an iPhone had been bought and Apple Music became their default source for their song collection. Swim loved it. To this day, they still use it, now being on a Samsung Galaxy S8. Spotify will have to wait."
13744,Apple Music,Joe Kaainoa,2,1,"While the app look nice, there are several major problems with this app. No controls in the notification area, all other apps that use audio have this and it really stands out that it is missing. Closing this app will not actually kill it, so it will still play music when the phone connects to the next bluetooth device. Sometimes the controls in the app doesn't work, usually trying to pause it, other parts are still responsive, just can't pause. Playback loop setting never saves. More issues..."
13745,Apple Music,Billy L,1,2,"I'm a paid subscriber for itunes' streaming serivce. At first the app worked well. I downloaded albums and listened to them offline on my commute. Then suddenly it wouldn't let me listen to them offline anymore, even though everything was already downloaded to my device. I have logged in and out of my account, restarted my phone, redownloaded the music. It won't let me listen to my downloaded music. It's really annoying because the reason I subscribed was so that I could listen to music offline"
13746,Apple Music,Andrew Singer,1,2,"Not what I've come to expect from Apple. The music quality is not that good, even with the highest setting on. The app doesn't support 2 factor authentication so it's impossible to subscribe from the app. Good job apple. They force you to use iTunes to sign up for a subscription. This is Android Apple, we dont have iTunes. You can't even do it online. What is this? The 90's? If you have explicit content turned off, it doesnt give you the radio version. Just can't play the song."
13747,Apple Music,Yaserinski Shahidovich,3,2,"The app is far from perfect, UI gets sluggish at times or just completely crashes. Sometimes songs won't download for offline listening and you'll have to clear the apps cache and restart your phone to get it to work. Other than that, I like the vast collection and as Spotify or Play Music isn't available where I live, this is my only best option."
13748,Apple Music,Collin Birchmeier,2,3,"I have never felt the need to write a review on anything before. This is the first one that I have ever written and for good reason. This app needs some work when it comes to streaming the music over android devices. Almost every single time I open and try to use this app, I will be sitting for 5 or more minutes trying to load a song. This problem will occur whether it is over wifi or mobile data with the best signal I can get. Hopefully Apple reads this and actually fixes it."
13749,Apple Music,Sarmad Asjad,3,0,"needs so much more improvement like the lag it has also the volume bar theres no control of volume, apple should optimise this app like they have on their phones if they want us to use it."
13750,Apple Music,Terrell Drew,1,1,Horrible. Does not work and will not play music. For android users I recommend tidal or spotify.
13751,Apple Music,Jake Brown,1,7,"I tried Apple Music on my new Android because I have thousands of songs from years of iTunes and iPhones. But apparently, Apple Music won't access those mp4 files - which are on the phone already - so I'd have to download them again via the app to listen offline with Apple Music. Even more frustrating, the app won't download any songs, and hours of research, reinstalling, etc hasn't provided a solution. So, I'm sticking with Google Music, which doesn't have those problems."
13752,Apple Music,James Parkies,1,0,DOWNLOADS ARE A PROBLEM! Slow or it won't download at all. Will sometimes download 2 songs on a 20 song playlists then stop. Please fix.
13753,Apple Music,Jennifer Kimball,2,5,"Having a really hard time getting this to work. First it tells me I don't have authorization to play the music, so I uninstall and reinstall. Then it won't let me sign in, now it won't stop asking me to sign in. and now it won't even let me play music and I have to redownload my entire library. How many hoops will have to go through to play the music I'm paying for?"
13754,Apple Music,ruth atsegbua-mohammed,1,4,"My trial period isn't over and i can't play music anymore. It just stopped working and keeps asking me to sign in when im already signed in and when i do type in my password, it says its incorrect without giving me the option to reset. Now i have a bunch of songs i can't play and if i uninstall, everything goes. This is disheartening. Review Edit So i cannot listen to any new songs or download anymore. except for the songs already in my library. You suck apple music. Uninstalling this app ASAP"
13755,Apple Music,sly1x,1,2,I like android more than iOS but my majority of my music was bought on iTunes. So when apple came out with an app for android I switched back. The app is ok but it stops playing music randomly. I notice it happens on the same songs or when I don't have a data connection (I downloaded all my music onto the device). I really wish Apple would fix this issue and actually allow an offline mode for when you're traveling and may not have a data connection.
13756,Apple Music,Hiyaa Saraswat,4,1,[Edit] I re-installed the app. The only drawback? I had to download all my playlists again. Initial problem: App not starting up. Rebooted my phone and yet not responding. Please assist.
13757,Apple Music,Peter Bucheler,1,1,Why aren't you prompted when adding duplicate songs to a playlist?! Beyond frustrating when Spotify has always done so. Apple music has a lot of opportunity for improvement and is not worth switching to.
13758,Apple Music,Kristen Massingo,1,0,I used to love apple music until they did the latest update. now it force stops and force closes everytime i use it. Please fix!!
13759,Apple Music,Abhishek Y,5,15,"After the recent update , The UI got changed a bit. But the app still crashes while loading the downloaded albums. When connected to the internet , the downloaded albums take lot of time to load. But why, they are already downloaded why are they taking time to load ?. Still some of the album's are still missing for my regional language when searched - Kannada. So could you have a look on this issues. Thank you."
13760,Apple Music,A Google user,1,1,"UI is very laggy. Playlists have bug where in, I have to open multiple times to see the list of songs. Randomly crashes. When I have downloaded the required songs offline in my playlist, I dont see a reason why the playlist should take time to load. And yeah, I am running a Snapdragon 835 with 6gb RAM on Pie. So its not the hardware. I have waited long for the bug fixes. We are not using your application for free you know?"
13761,Apple Music,Pravin Daz,3,1,"App is not stable.. it's really slow loading music, suggestions, search, anything tat needs network to load up n crashes offen doing so.. it doesn't stand a chance to it's own de actual/apple once perform, which is best of all others in it's platform n tis is at near to de worst of all in here.."
13762,Apple Music,David Plecher,2,0,"keeps crashing during playback since its recent update. I can maybe get 4 songs and it stops playback and says ""apple music keeps stopping"". fix this bug!"
13763,Apple Music,Wes Walters,1,1,I am being told I am offline when attempting to access my downloaded playlist in airplane mode. I am using a S10+.
13764,Apple Music,Hildegard Kinnear,1,0,dear apple music creators. your app keeps crashing. please fix. read the pleas of your paying customers and respond. unsubscribing is imminent.
13765,Apple Music,isaac anguiano,1,1,It keeps force closing on my Samsung S9. I can't get albums or playlists to keep playing without interruption.
13766,Apple Music,Juan Alonso,2,69,"Cannot play music half of the times despite having the songs downloaded locally, the app crashes or does nothing. Yesterday it stopped playing music completely, and only reinstalling helped. The 50+ song recommendations I've tried so far were a miss, like all the radio stations. I'm surprised that this is coming from Apple. I would have already moved to Spotify if it weren't for Apple Music's UI and its smooth sync across iTunes."
13767,Apple Music,M Bee,1,3,"without a doubt one of the worst and most frustrating music players available, made worse by the fact you have to use it if you want to listen to the music available through apple. missing key features available on other music players and numerous features that make the experience difficult. only people who worship all things apple Inc. would like this player."
13768,Apple Music,Prateek Rana,1,73,"The app isn't downloading the songs, itjust cancels the download after some time, I've logged out and back in, I've reinstalled the app, butthere is no effect. I use apple music on a daily basis but I'm thinking of changing if this continues. Please fix this problem apple. Its disappointing. Apparently it is not compatible with android 9 please fix"
13769,Apple Music,PREM SAI,4,54,The latest update (25th Jan 2019) is really bad. i've been editing my playlist and the app automatically restarts. it has happened for about 5 times in an hour and is annoying if this continues. wouldn't want to uninstall such a great music app due to small bug issues. It would be great if this is resolved soon.
13770,Apple Music,Sam Casertano,1,24,"terribly designed. full of bugs and glitches. it will frequently either crash or stop playing my music. album art frequently downloads incorrectly so only half the art downloads, the other half is just glitched pixels. Music won't play all together if I have a slow connection. And you know they're not really gonna fix it. why would they?"
13771,Apple Music,A Google user,3,110,"Having come from an iPhone, I used this app alot and paid for the family plan. I recently switched to the Samsung S9 device and the app worked just as good as on the iPhone until the Android Pie OS dropped. Now everytime I want to listen to music it will randomly pause after 5 or so songs have played, then once you hit play to resume listening is will happen again after 5 or 15 songs. A fix would be appreciated so I can actually listen while in the truck or on the bike."
13772,Apple Music,David Turner,1,1,I have an account and am subscribed to CBS All Access but can't access my account unless I pay an additional $9.99!
13773,Apple Music,Fitri Amirrol,1,0,"The app frequently stops songs that are playing for no reason at all. While using the app, it would also randomly force quit. The final nail in the coffin is when all music that I have saved and downloaded in my accout just disappears one morning - there was no warning at all, it just says my library is empty. It really sucks that the Android version of this app is so unreliable. Apple Music is my favourite music-streaming app, but not when it acts up so much on my new Pixel."
13774,Apple Music,Trinity Springman,5,1,Great!!! I feel like it needs an option in the songs category for recently added
13775,Apple Music,meeko94,2,17,"My cellphone service provider made Apple Music free for anyone who had purchased an above average unlimited plan. Naturally, the first thing I did was cancel my Spotify account and go all in on Apple Music... What a horrible mistake. Music will stop playing for no reason, songs will restart if you pause, the interface is horrible, playlists are way less substantial... In short, I will gladly decline my free Apple Music subscription and pay 15 dollars a month for a Spotify subscription."
13776,Apple Music,Phomolo Mpe,4,3,"Ever since the last update, I can't just click on songs to play them. I have to queue them to play next and then skip the current track or else it keeps restarting despite me choosing a new song. Before that, I did not find the app problematic in any way whatsoever. Thank you for making it available on the Android platform."
13777,Apple Music,Tony Cook,2,1,"Please fix the radio. On two separate android devices, a galaxy note 5 and currently a moto z3 play, I go to play a station and it will play anywhere between 1-3 songs before just stopping out of the blue. I then have to tap on the radio station again for it to play 1-3 more songs over, repeating every few songs. This is annoying & were I not in a family plan, I would definitely go back to spotify. Everything else works fine for me, the songs will play normal if I'm not using the radio function."
13778,Apple Music,Amy Lynette,1,16,"I am paying $5 a month for this horrible app. I can't even play anything other than ONE SPECIFIC SONG. If I try to, it rapidly shuffles through everything in my library until it gets to that song and plays it. Terrible. This needs to be fixed ASAP because it makes this app completely useless for me."
13779,Apple Music,A Google user,1,3,"It cannot sort by added date. And also mess up with current playlists order and then sync that mess all over other devices. And a low quality notification bar icon (blurry, low resolution). It make me feel I am using a free service. And unable to turn off album art in lock screen."
13780,Apple Music,Andrew Squires,1,0,only use this because i have a free trial. buggy app constantly skipping unless its the primary app open. really frustrating especially when driving.
13781,Apple Music,Juan Carlos Sierra Rinc√≥n,1,5,"I've had a really bad experience with this app, music takes an eternity to be downloaded, and it is really slow in general, there's nothing smooth about it. Have to wait several minutes for a search to come up with results, load my playlist, show my music, etc. Nothing compared to what the iOS app offers. God bless the souls of people with low/mid range devices using this, I'd advise them to look for alternatives, as I'm doing"
13782,Apple Music,A Google user,2,1,"just ok. i switched to apple music b/c it has the playlists i need for work as a fitness instructor. unfortunatly, apple music does not have the playlists that i enjoy. i find myself getting frustrated not being able to find the right music for my mood in leasure time. Also we are finding it not very user friendly when it comes to adding family members."
13783,Apple Music,A Google user,2,10,Why remove the ability to be able to view how long playlists are? just makes the app less user friendly. No one from Apple Technical support seems to be able to resolve this for Android users?
13784,Apple Music,A Google user,4,391,"I switched to Apple Music recently after using Spotify for 5 years (their latest UI update left the app unusable). This is an excellent app with a really easy to use UI, it does everything I need it to. Very user friendly, love it. I'm so happy to have my music back and at an affordable student rate too."
13785,Apple Music,Patric Duong,2,2,"This app shouldn't be in the Google Play Store or generally any other Application Stores besides in the Apple ecosystem. I would had given this app a higher rating if I didn't need have access for a monthly subscription for music that I previously paid for when I had an iPhone or still use iTunes. I haven't tested fully for Apple Music Subscription but I didn't feel the need buy it to use this app what it's for. If you want Apple Music on your Android, use iTunes from a computer and transfer it."
13786,Apple Music,Jarred Jackson,4,0,"i really enjoy apple music, just the simplicity of how apple organizes the library calms my ocd. however in the last couple days since the last update on the 29th of March. the app keeps crashing on me, or pausing by itself or just not going on to the next track. please, please, please fix these, i use this app everyday to get through my work day as well as keep whats left of my sanity. i would greatly appreciate it"
13787,Apple Music,Kate Souroup,3,0,"Apple music is a great app for finding and listening to any music you want. But as an android user (used to have an iPhone but had to switch) the app has let me down on many occasions. Songs won't download, art wallpaper won't show properly (either it's black or half is missing), playlists go missing, music will pause or turn off by itself. Usually a re-download will fix these issues but lately, even after re-downloading, nothing is changing. Please fix this, I want to keep using your app."
13788,Apple Music,jagdeesh raja,1,1,I am starting with one star because i can't post with a zero star. I am paying not to browse albums but to actually listen to them. when I try playing any song or album It just automatically skips to next song and to the next so on till all the songs in that particular album has been exhausted. FIX IT NOW before it's too late to bank on the android users with your streaming services.
13789,Apple Music,Lennon Murphy,1,22,"trash. if you dont have a paid for apple music account this app is useless. i just wanted to download a song i bought, this app wont let it happen without paying for the ability to sync your library. It's absurd; also why I avoid apple products all together. they dont care about ease of use anymore, its all about the money."
13790,Apple Music,Peter Fichtner,5,414,This app is perfect. I've used many other streaming services before but I only need this one now. And the suggested playlists are incredible. they're focused towards my style of music while also showing me some amazing other bands and music styles that I'm so glad I've found now. couldnt be happier with this app
13791,Apple Music,A Google user,2,2,"I switched from Apple to Android not too long ago and decided to keep apple music since I couldn't find a 1:1 option for transferring all my music over. This app has me seriously considering abandoning my 10k+ library of music, however. The app constantly crashes, shuffled playlists will suddenly stop playing even though there's more songs in the playlist, and it frequently takes 5-10 seconds for music to buffer even though I have them downloaded to my phone. I can go on. Terrible app overall."
13792,Apple Music,Cora Kirkpatrick,2,2,Your latest release is unstable and crashes constantly. Radio stations will stop playing abruptly then when you press play again it cycles through the same 5 songs it just played. And downloaded music doesn't work. It skips like a scratched CD. Please fix this. I can't use the service that I'm paying for.
13793,Apple Music,Fah Paveenuch,1,1,The app is constantly crashing in android and yesterday it's totally stop working. I pay for this so pls fix immediately.

I travel and I absolutely need to be able to play music offline. If there's no fix before my next trip, I'll have to cancel my subscription and switch to a different music app."
13797,Apple Music,N J,1,13,"Well coming from an iPhone 8, I would have maintained my subscription with Apple Music but this app has too many bugs. None of the downloads are working or loading.

Also, all of my downloaded songs vanished out of Apple Music.Not to mention when I try to download songs now, they won't download but merely just try to download.I'm canceling my subscription on the 11th and going to Tidal. I'm not about to go through this for $120 a year."

I'll have to unlock the phone and press play on the Apple music player. needs allot of work"
13800,Apple Music,A Google user,3,2,"Apple please, you are a multi-billion dollar company and your app still has so many bugs - I cannot set custom playlist cover art, my downloaded music won't play offline and some album artwork is half loaded properly and the the other half looks like an old CRT TV looking for input signal - if you could please make this app work as well as it does on iOS it would be very much appreciated since I am paying for this service every month"
13801,Apple Music,Utkarsh Tiwari,1,7,"There are a lot of problems with the app on my Pixel 2 XL, the music wont download at once, even after like 8-10 tries if it gets downloaded then as soon as i go offline then some of the downloaded music won't play. The songs which aren't even downloaded are listed as downloaded songs. Library has lost other filter categories apart from downloaded music , only thats visible to me.

I have checked using other music apps but only facing this problem with Apple music."
13803,Apple Music,A Google user,1,38,this app is everything against apple stands for in terms of quality. apple probably hates anyone not buying their overpriced phones. i own a macbook and ipad and there is no way im buying your overpriced iphone. if you want to transition to a services company you cannot have such crappy app. it's damn slow! every touch on the app feels like it needs improvement. search is too slow.

13807,Apple Music,Kiara :'\,3,0,"Overall I believe there's good quality but I think there's a bug or something because, once I updated the app my music keeps not playing I'll click it and it won't play no matter what I do, so I clear my cache and exit out all my apps over and over but still nothing.

I cancelled my subscription last year after THEY WOULDN'T LET ME DOWNLOAD A FREE APP because I owed 79 PENCE üòÇüòÇ joke thing. Now they've been charging my bank card every month for Apple music even though I've already cancelled it. Just realised they've taken like 3 months payments. I've cancelled it yet again . let's see next month now . back to android thank God. their playlists suck ass. app drains your battery .
13810,Apple Music,Lalhmangaih zuala,1,185,"I was an IOS user before, but due to the mooching policy of Apple I became an android user ever since and never look back. But I continued using Apple Music due to the fact that it has the largest collection of songs. With this crappy Android app comparing to the IOS version may be Apple is thinking of winning back some deflected users. My resentment for Apple has grown even more. WE ARE PAID USER TOO."
13811,Apple Music,Lana Lana,5,1,"I love how I can listen music everywere I go, I really appriciate how easy is is to work with, I dont see anything wrong for people having trouble to install the app like I had, first delete all of the tabs and try several times, I dont think that anything else should be the problem that the app has to deal with, well done whoever made this app!"
13812,Apple Music,Slightly Athletic,2,6,"Really disappointed - It has a lot of issues and I'm running it on a new OnePlus 6T. Often comes up error messages when trying to play downloaded music and now won't download anything despite repeated attempts.... the downloading icon just spins around but nothing actually downloads!

13817,Apple Music,416-647-437,4,6,"It has quite a good international music library, which was appreciated and one of the 2 reasons why i picked it over Google Play Music. The second reason was that it had an equalizer which allowed me to eek out a bit more out of my setup but that feature was cut so I will be going back to Google Play Music."
13818,Apple Music,Justin Rotello,1,1,Your crappy app just deleted my entire library. Now I remember why I do not buy Apple products.

13822,Apple Music,Santiago Hurtado,3,1,"The app itself is great. Streaming is quick and in great quality. The only really annoying thing that is happening is that downloads fail after a while. When you first install the app it works, but when downloading songs a couple of days later it queues the songs for download and it never works."
13823,Apple Music,Tanishq Chawla,4,1,"The database is good and has a crazy amount of music, I've been using it for more than a year now, but I've been facing an issue in my realme u1 phone, which is that it is not supporting the equalizer of the phone, no matter how I tweak it the output is the same plain music, kindly look into it."

It worked before the last update ( though it only worked from time to time ) this time its completely broken. oh I also gave the app permissions to my device every time. It works on older versions of the app...V 1.0"
13825,Apple Music,A Google user,1,6,I read the other reviews and realized that they've been using the app on android. I thought it was just my app tweaking so i came here to check and saw the reviews about how bad the app is. But the app functions perfectly fine when on iOS which is obviously purposeful either on apples part or on googles either way it was to switch you from android to apple or from apple music to a different streaming app. Its a shame that the app has to work like a disabled deer.
13826,Apple Music,Eliezer Chamizo,1,4,This app continuously stops playing between 5-7 songs. Dont know if it's a marketing strategy or programming flaw. This app needs a serious review and upgrade. I believe that it should be treated as a beta version and not charge $$ for its use until all bugs are addressed and fixed.
13827,Apple Music,Bill Bolton-Wade,1,1,"Wouldn't even play my music. What a waste of my time. I wanted this so that I could purchase music but it just wouldn't work. I selected the artists, added them to playlists and when I pressed 'play', the app just hung there."

13830,Apple Music,Anton Yurin,2,1,Hello Android Software Developers at Apple - your app does not play music that was downloaded to the device for offline use because it says it cannot connect to the internet. Should not this be a very basic first unit test you write?
13831,Apple Music,Ayeni Olusina,1,1,Poor user experience. Limited functionality. I have been looking of a way to put a song on repeat
13832,Apple Music,Cthulhu The Sleeper,4,4,Great app definitely in my top 3 on my phone. My only issue is when I'm in offline mode with my mobile data turned off it still say I can't listen to the music I have on my phones library I have to close app and relaunch it to refresh it evrrytime before my music in my library(downloaded) shows again. I have to either turn Data off or go into settings and turn my data mode on and off again to allow to see my albums that on stored onto my internal storage. wierd issue but still good app

13834,Apple Music,A Google user,1,1,This is by far the glitchest and buggiest app ive ever seen. No thought went into this version of the app at all. Its just a half baked port of its Apple counterpart. Each update seems to make the app worse instead of better. Get it together guys. Make it work or get rid of it entirely.
13835,Apple Music,John Henry,4,1041,"All those giving this app a bad review are probably using low conf Android phones. if you have 3gb ram upwards, this app will work well for you.Though it crashes a few times, that I'm not giving it a 5star yet. I use Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro, with 4gb ram, all i did was to login my iPhone account and I'm enjoying unlimited music and download. i don't use my iPhone to listen to songs anymore because my Android has a bigger battery. For you to enjoy Apple Music, you need Internet. Great App!"
13836,Apple Music,Jeries Kheir,1,2,absolutely garbage service. the music constantly pauses after a few songs and goes to the beginning of the last song played. ive complaned a few times to get some help but nothing. so frustrating not to be able to listen to more that trhee songs in a row.
13837,Apple Music,John Murphy,1,2,App is always freezing up and now it wont even open. I even tried to uninstall and install again...no luck
13838,Apple Music,vicky n,1,1,Unexpected pauses and crashes all the time with their recent update. Time to switch over to another app maybe!
13839,Apple Music,Dylan Fisher,1,1,It literally changes you $6.99 a month to listen to your music. THE MUSIC I ALREADY PAID FOR.
13840,Apple Music,3412Ice,3,2,"Lately, the notification doesn't work, the music doesn't start playing/stop once using it. Moreover, frequently the music just does not start playing when selecting a song or album (even if downloaded) and it's necessary to close and reopen the app to hear anything."
13841,Apple Music,Jessica Chambers,1,3,"I used to LOVE this app, it was so much simpler than spotify, but since the last update I haven't been able to download any of my music, which means that now I can use the app outside of the house cause I can't stream it. PLEASE FIX IT, or I'm gunna have to risk spotify again."
13842,Apple Music,Kartikey Mishr,1,2,"What a poorly desinged application. I tried for 3 hours to login to my Apple account but for some reason the app refuses to stay in memory and so every time i pull either the notification shade or switch to the SMS app for the verification code, the app refreshes and essentially invalidates my OTP.

I've reached out to Apple over a week ago qnd haven't heard back. As someone who personally works for Samsung, this experience helps le easily sell against your products."
13849,Apple Music,Omega Urquhart,2,2,since the update it won't play or just keeps spinning. also the phone version you cannot sort to play songs how you want like the desktop version. and I'm pretty sure most people use their phone more than their desktop. I've switched back to Pandora until they can fix this bug.

13853,Apple Music,Kalyn Wheatley,3,9,"I'm a fan of this app because it allowed me to keep utilizing all my itunes purchases even though I switched to a samsung. But this latest update has caused my music not to play continuously. It stops every few songs and I have to manually start it up again. It's mostly just a problem when my hands are busy or if I'm running, but it shouldn't be a problem to begin with."
13854,Apple Music,A Google user,2,6,"The amount of times my music just randomly pauses or doesn't switch to the next song when one has finished is annoying because I have to stop what I'm doing to change it manually or sit in silence until I'm finished. Not only that, but everytime I download music to listen offline. If I come off of the app, it stops me from accessing all of my playlists and then I have uninstall the app and redownload everything. App is a joke. The wondows (pc) version is even worse.. Disrespectful."

13859,Apple Music,Yakshit Anand,1,0,"lots of bugs after the recent update. it is lagging a lot. Many of the times the songs stop playing after about after 15-20 minutes, until I manually go back to app and hit the play button again. It force closes a few times. I hit some other song, but a song previous to that, or even 3-4 blocks before the selection gets played, and then I have to close the app and then again load it up. also, many a times, I am unable to download or add songs to my playlist. They just don't get downloaded."

I have hoped it would get better since Im not a fan of the spotify platform but this is getting tiresome. Even on the new s10 it lags and crashes. No fixes have helped."

I had written to you guys and was told that was just to check whether your account was genuine and the money would be refunded back. However, now I see that 75rs, are being deducted from my account Periodically"
13867,Apple Music,Brionna Wimberly,1,2,"I got this app because it was free with my Version Plan and I am disappointed.

To be truthful I would give this 0/5 stars if I could."
13868,Apple Music,Akoni Kline,1,116,"Compared to my Google Play Music app, this Apple Music app is poorly designed, convoluted and HORRIBLE, I repeat HORRIBLE user interface.

13874,Apple Music,Devavrat K,3,271,"Amazing music selection on this app, although the app UX is absolutely 1990. I will not continue my subscription because this does not stream on any of my music devices (Soundbar, Google Cast etc.). I can only play using Bluetooth which is restrictive. Better alternatives: Spotify (easily plays on any platform), Saavn."
13875,Apple Music,Banana Boat,4,4,it's good but it will randomly start playing a song in my library when my phone is off sometimes. I keep my phone in my back pocket at school and I thankfully turn the volume all the way down but the next time I check my phone it says it's like halfway through one of my playlists when I closed out the app and turned off my phone.
13876,Apple Music,Jeff V,1,15,"Totally broken. When I play a playlist, it plays maybe 3-4 songs then just stops for no reason. Useless.

For no particular reasons some songs don't play unless you restart the app. And there's the frequent termination of contracts which out of nowhere makes entire albums no longer available in your library. Doesn't matter i'm using android, for a paid service, I expected better performance. And Apple has catching up to do to spotify when it comes to contracts."

App also keeps telling me to log into my apple account. I have tried multiple devices and vehicles, Android & Apple products as well to eliminate possibility of issues with the device or vehicles. Good thing I have it as a free trial. Spotify is so much better, I am going to continue my Spotify services and cancel this Apple Music Free trial."
13884,Apple Music,Jaskaran Sandhu,1,2,I want this app to be better. I think it's really stupid that you can't sort all your songs as recently added. It has a recently added section but you can only play those songs one by one. It adds each of them as an album. Fix that and I'll give this app 5 stars.
13885,Apple Music,Theodor E,3,0,"I can no longer access my music library on the phone. A popup keeps appearing and disappearing, making the app freeze.

13891,Apple Music,Raphael N,1,0,"Awful app, but sadly it has one of the biggest libraries. ""Radio stations"" play like two or three songs then repeat the same songs. Shuffling seems to fail after extended use. Any other music player on the play store is better and probably has all the functions this can offer and more, and you don't need a subscription to listen to anything."
13892,Apple Music,Michael Njogu,4,42,"Absolutely loved the app when I was using Android Oreo but after updating to Pie, I can't download music to my device. I've read several other reviews by people with the same problem. Please give us some good news. We need a fix asap!"

13895,Apple Music,Nathan C,3,4,"The app works well enough on the. whole, but seems to have a bug preventing me from playing music I've downloaded to my phone with cellular data off. This will make it useless on a plane or overseas. 5 stars otherwise - easy to use. UPDATE - deleting the app and reinstalling resolved the issues, but after updating this morning, it's back, where i cant play anything without having data enabled. Apple really needs to work on their testing when they perform updates - not good enough"

Now the music appears in Google Play music (GPM) but GPM plays only 5 seconds of each song then quits. The music is on my phone not in the cloud. Apple Music is supposedly installed on my phone, but when I try to use it, it demands payment. It's holding my music for ransom! i I already paid iTunes for the music! I want my music back without paying again for a subscription."

13902,Apple Music,Elijah Colas,3,0,"Was working perfectly up until a couple weeks ago. Now the audio stops abruptly, but the song timer continues to move along.

Update caused all of my downloaded songs to dissapear and and the app isn't allowing me to download new or old songs... developers are aware. No fix yet for Samsung users."
13939,Apple Music,Kartikey Gupta,2,3,"As a user who's coming from the Spotify environment, Apple Music felt like a disappointment. The UI feels lacking, with a lot of white space. It's not as appealing as Spotify. There is also a significant buffering period between the time a track is selected and when playback actually starts. This isn't an issue in Spotify. The catalogue is pretty diverse, more so than Spotify. The search results can be organized in a more meaningful way. Playlists can made to be better tailored to user tastes."
13940,Apple Music,Lauren Lavelle,1,2,wont let me go onto forgot password which is stupid because i forgot what It was on my iPhone because i lost it 3 months ago. I need to cancel my subscription and im sorry but im not having you take a payment for something im not using. i tried to do it online still not letting me.
13941,Apple Music,Dylan Mickleburgh,2,0,"I have a couple issues with this app, I love apple music that's why I have kept using it after changing over to Samsung, but I have noticed that even if music is downloaded it still needs data to play, why is this? it never happened when I had an iPhone... secondly since the last update if I'm playing music and skip a song it only plays the next song then stops playing, when I press play again it will play 2 songs then stop, I have to close the app and restart the playlist then it plays fine."
13942,Apple Music,Nicole Tambini,1,4,"it was working fine and now I cant get it to open, all I get is a white screen. so dissatisfied!!"
13943,Apple Music,Aaron Jordan,5,0,i love it. the UI is seamlessly transported to the android platform. no learning curve needed.
13944,Apple Music,michael ashton,1,3,"Terrible. since the update the app doesn't allow downloading music anymore. permissions are all allowed. deleted cleared cache and still no good. randomly stops too at times. very disappointing, as om paying for a service that's not fit for purpose."
13945,Apple Music,Siobhan Howell,1,2,This app used to work fine on my android device but of late I cannot download ANYTHING!!! The app also regularly crashes. If it continues I will not be renewing my apple music subscription- plenty of other choices out there that work perfectly!
13946,Apple Music,A Google user,2,0,"Apple music works well and I have been quite happy in terms of the music options and recommendations. It is just a bit disappointing that moving from iOS to android the app itself seems to suffer from a lot of bugs. Downloading music is the best option for me to conserve data, but being offline seems to be a major problem for the app and makes using it extremely cumbersome unless you are permanently connected to WiFi."
13947,Apple Music,A Google user,1,18,"tapping on song doesn't play music, have to tap on play button on last song, then it plays. downloading not working. edit: please add support for setting alarm option in app! such a shame edit 2: why the hell it always crash while Playing. edit 3:api response from server is too slow, at first I thought it may be isp down, but other apps Spotify, YouTube, Play music works blazzin fast!"
13948,Apple Music,Adam Motala,3,1,"an overall okay experience that gets the job done, however it is really frustrating when the app does not ""realise"" that an album I'm trying to listen to is already downloaded, and it takes forever to load for no apparent reason."
13949,Apple Music,dhruv singhal,3,3,"Where do I begin? I use a Samsung S9 so that takes out the chance of it being my phone's fault. This is one of the few paid apps on my phone and it is the only app that constantly crashes or has new unusual bugs every two weeks. basically, it constantly glitches. Now, I don't know if this is only happening with the android version of the app but I wouldn't be surprised if that was the case. Tracks restart on their own, liked music becomes difficult to delete, I mean Apple what is happening?"
13950,Apple Music,Vivian Chen,2,1,"Has so many weird bugs that make you unable to play music once in a while and forcing you to redownload the app or clear the data, sometimes the artwork gets distorted, sometimes it gets confused on what songs are downloaded and which aren't... Altogether very problematic."
13951,Apple Music,Andrew van Gent,4,0,"Great interface, music selection, recommendations and radio stations. Only drawback for me is that when I remove a playlist, songs I have downloaded are then removed. I don't want to remove the songs from my downloads or library, just the playlist."
13952,Apple Music,Caio Gabriel,1,1,After the last update i can not download new musics into a playlist. Android 6 (LG X Power)

I can add songs to the playlist but it wouldn't show when I go to playlist. I have like ten different playlists but the one I want isn't populating, please fix this issue!!"
13955,Apple Music,Isidro Mendez,4,0,well it doesnt play any music at all just got off the phone with customer support but they are gonna have to get back to me in 2 days will give better rating once fixed good thing i have a free trial but if this keeps happening i dont think I will move over from Spotify. UPDATE: Sounds really good and louder than spotify. Probably the only app that can come close to them. I have paused my Spotify subscription to see how these next 2 months go.
13956,Apple Music,Jonathan Solano,3,2,The app is 10x better on iphones (obvious probably) because it doesnt lag on there at all. The app crashes a lot on my pixel 2 and lags a few times a day. I'm usually needing to close the app out and its getting annoying.
13957,Apple Music,Michael Teward,3,0,"I have downloaded all of my iCloud music library. When playing some tracks once they are finished, the next song does not auto.atically play. Instead the app takes you to the beginning of the first song and the app is paused. I have tried removing and re adding the songs which are affected but I still have the same issue."
13958,Apple Music,Ian Fernandes,1,1,"The app keeps asking me to verify my student status. before i can click any option, it gets stuck in an infinite refresh loop for the verification page, and eventually crashes. i cant listen to any music anymore, without the app crashing repeatedly."
13959,Apple Music,A Google user,2,1,Apple Music does a decent job with its core advertised features however vital essential functions are embarrassingly missing or broken; such as an explorable file manager system and actually downloading music to device storage. This is unacceptable especially since i went for the Premium subscription to fully experience Apples service. And as usual Apple showcases their relentless greed and proves inferior to Android and alternatives....
13960,Apple Music,Danny Clayton,5,1,"I usually dislike Apple's products, but Apple Music has much more music from independent artists and labels, as well has a much better algorithm for suggesting music."

13964,Apple Music,Raybon Taco,3,1,My phone updated it's OS and Apple Music crashed constantly! I reinstalled AM and now it works like it used to.
13965,Apple Music,Axel Torres,3,0,"everytime I try to edit a playlist the app crashes, it seems unbearable at this point in modern time that this feature is not correctly implemented"
13966,Apple Music,Pulasthi Hewamanna,3,1,Though I love the music suggestions I don't like the fact that when I select a song on the list sometimes a different song plays instead. It makes the experience feel buggy. However this doesn't happen when you search for a particular song and play it.
13967,Apple Music,A Google user,1,1,It's really good.. But suddenly it's stopped playing songs... I'm clicking on the song and it just won't play.. I've tried asking the Google assistant to play... Restarted my phone twice... Nothing... Please fix this asap.( Will change review as soon as it's fixed)
13968,Apple Music,A Google user,1,0,"At first worked fine but has recently stopped working. I switched from apple to android recently and I was using apple music but recently the app has constantly been crashing then I was not able to play any music. every time I press play on a song it plays for a couple of seconds then stops . I have tried logging out then back in, deleting and rediwnliading but nothing has worked."
13969,Apple Music,K Kloehn,1,0,"This used to be a good app that i recommended, now it is junk, cant download anything, sometimes i can instantly see my songs and playlists, other times, it takes minutes before anything shows up, playing music is iffy, tried uninstalling and reinstalling, nothing changed, everything i had downloaded is gone and now cant get it back. the only reason i still have the app installed is so i can reference my music selections while building the same list on a new service."
13970,Apple Music,Andy N,1,1,Not as good as Pandora. Playlists are only songs that were/are popular. Charged me $10 to cancel my membership after i realized how much it sucks. This app is a wannabe and a failure.
13971,Apple Music,Stefan Poirier,1,2,"Offline doesn't wrk properly. Constantly saying that it need to connect to the internet. App sometimes constantly runs ""playing"" music when nothing is playing."
13972,Apple Music,Terrance Yoon,1,2,developers need to test the app before they release it. There are way too many bugs and errors
13973,Apple Music,Nathan Fan,2,8,"URGENT NOTICE. needs a hotfix ASAP. Unusable, very buggy, app will crash often and offline saved playlists upon opening will not show any music in playlist. currently, download button for songs is stuck and wont download. Adding a song to a playlist wont work unless you add to Library first. Please rework your app."
13974,Apple Music,Ged McManus,1,4,"absolute terrible app. every song you choose, you have to through option to get apple music for 3 months atreaming free. also cannot listen to songs before you buy. thank goodness i left apple many years ago. about as good as a bent ipad pro!!!! rubbish......total rubbish"
13975,Apple Music,–í–ª–∞–¥ –ö–æ—Ü—é—Ä–±–∞,3,1,"The app is good, but there are some disappointments. It often doesn't want to download music. Also, it sometimes doesn't start playing downloaded music, if mobile data is on. I hope developers will fix this in future update."
13976,Apple Music,Stuart Davidson,3,3,"Honestly, I think this is so much better than Spotify but my god is it buggy! 1) I move my storage from my device to my SD card because it is much more expansive, however the available space shown is still that on my device and not on my SD card? 2) whenever I download more than two albums at once I end up with corrupted album artwork, which looks horrible. 3) there's no option to change the bit rate of streamed songs? what if I'm low on data and don't have Wi-Fi to download?"
13977,Apple Music,A Google user,2,3,"Excellent source of music, I've been paying for apple music for 2+ years. Apple music ar one point offered offline listening, but revoked that option without word to users. I've since canceled my membership yet am still getting monthly charges. BOO Apple music. App crashes often too"
13978,Apple Music,Martin Cupit,1,13,"Broken (again). After the last update the app no longer plays more than 3-4 songs from a playlist before stopping. This has been an issue with previous builds as well but the last one seemed to work fine. Unfortunately its just a lot easier to use Spotify if Apple are not that serious about producing a quality app. I mean can you imagine if this was an iOS app, would have been fixed a long time ago."
13979,Apple Music,super weenie hut jrs,1,0,"tl;dr i can't log in my last phone (iPhone 6s) shattered + i had to disable iMessage externally. i had 2 factor authentication and i don't think i can disable it. i ask to send a verification code and i can't get the code because it sends to my (disabled) iMessage instead of SMS. i emailed tech support and they did nothing, offering the same outdated advice as their website. i'm still happy having no problems using iTunes on windows though."

For a couple of weeks now, i make a playlist and when i come back to the app, my songs are gone and the title is reset. Is this a Google RAM problem or an Apple Music app problem? I spend hours curating a playlist only to have it vanish. Spent hours on chat support yesterday and they're telling me it an app problem. besides crashes, I didn't have many problems with this app before. now, its almost unusable üò°üò°üò°"

13985,Apple Music,A Google user,1,3,Why does every update seem to make this worse? Not only does it not download songs amd frequently crashes but now when im playing music itll pause aftee every 2 songs so ill have to get my phone out and click play again which is supwr annoying while im driving. The only thing stopping me from going to spotify is that ive always had all my music on itunes and cba to transfer it over.
13986,Apple Music,Jeff Thompson,5,0,Absolutely awesome to get my Itunes account on my android phone! IPod for me new tunes and this gives me an Ipod on my Android for older tunes! After this latest update my download and shuffle issues appear gone! So it's 5 stars! Thank you. :)
13987,Apple Music,patrick halcrow,2,0,i have this app on my samsung galasy s 9 through an EE promotion. It used to work fine and i didnt have to sign in. Now it requests my password all the time and it seems to crash or the music just does not buffee all the time. My internet and phone is fine. Any suggestion on how to fix the problem before i just delete it would be appreciated!
13988,Apple Music,Paul Reed,2,1,This app is not up to Apple quality at all. I frequently have downloaded music that I have to constantly delete and redownload because it won't let me play the saved music. That plus other runtime stability issues cause me to want to move back to Spotify..
13989,Apple Music,Adam Clark,1,2,i use this iTunes every day but now it won't open just stays on a white screen! Please sort it out
13990,Apple Music,Brian Njihia,4,0,Great app!! I wish it had dark mode though. The white theme is too bright especially at night.
13991,Apple Music,Azi 5500,2,4,every song stutter and most of the music in my library are missing and it won't let me add them back. even when I reinstalled it I still have the same problems
13992,Apple Music,Michael McFarland,2,3,I liked the app even though it was lacking in a lot of songs from my favorite artist Juice Wrld and they kept removing songs that from my playlist saying they were no longer available in this country. But as of a few weeks ago I can no longer download music at all! I am super disappointed in this. Now I can't even use the app! I am stuck with just sound cloud now. I personally think even soundcloud is better than apple music if I can't download my music anymore.
13993,Apple Music,A Google user,1,0,"In iPhone it works on even 2g networks even when u r listening songs online, but on Android, it takes forever and buffer even on offline music, even when you are on pretty good WiFi or getting great 4G speed on your phone. I love their play lists and collections, but it looks like I am not going to renew it after it expires this time. They must be throttling it on Android devices on purpose as Apple is known for this kind of strategy. I have a device with 845 for processer and 6gigs of RAM."
13994,Apple Music,A Google user,1,0,I am part of a Family Plan Subscription and I can't download any songs on my OnePlus 6 using the Apple Music latest version.

Please fix the bug and allow us to have a smooth experience with the app which we are paying for! There are also problems with the album arts. They tend to be distorted or not appear at all sometimes.

14003,Apple Music,Trenton Neu,2,3,"it always worked good for me, but recently I have some issues downloading. the worst part is as you listen to a song itll cut out for just a millisecond every few seconds and it is extremely irritating. plus every couple songs itll just crash and you have to go back to the app and press play. ever since 2019 ish I have been super pissed off, the only reason I still use this app is because I have thousands and thousands of songs, if it's not fixed soon I will go to spotify"

14041,Apple Music,George Umo,2,6,this app or apple themselves are not impressive at all after so many years and law suites everywhere. Downloaded music does not play on all devices and sometimes it just stops playing. restating sometimes severally could solve the problem temporarily. I will happen again. Apple has a name to protect and I don't think they are ready for the world yet. Still USA based.

14045,Apple Music,Sammie Beatty,1,1,"Can't for the life of me get anything to play. I've logged in and out multiple times, uninstalled the app then reinstall. Nothing. It's worked on my phone for months then suddenly nothing is playing."
14046,Apple Music,Vera Karavchuk,1,0,"Omnipoems belong to me alone. You need to return stolen funds to a prisoner of religious War and disabled citizen on Medicare who tried to submit my earlier medical papers to help Military eople afflicted by PTSD and schizophrenia five years ago, in case you are wondering to take longer to decide to return what doesn't belong to ""you"" so that you are still sleeping on it when the crossbow or sniper comes and goes more rightfully."
14047,Apple Music,George Hatzipapas,2,0,"in the last update consumes too much battery. also has other problems like does not download songs sometimes, when you don't have good signal it does nit llay songs but only when you put it at flight mode, sometimes it needs to check & finalize your library and it happens when you don't have a good signal and at least it occurred once it deleted all of my livrary but it occupied the space until I logged out & in again."
14048,Apple Music,Ryley Macaulay,1,0,"heyo, since the last update this app doesnt play music, nearly been a week this is outrageous, definitely cancelling membership"
14049,Apple Music,Jon Kurzhals,5,0,Fantastic app. Best music app I have used. The updates have been beneficial. Occasional crashing
14050,Apple Music,Afeez Lawal,3,17,"Dear Apple, I have over 6GB of downloaded music, my library refreshed and boom, I can't access them anymore. This is the second time its happening to me, I had to download them all over again the first time. What can I do this time? P.S the internet is expensive here"
14051,Apple Music,Krishna Marathe,1,4,"Dear Apple, if you think that I'll buy your mediocre iPhone just to be able to use Apple music, you'd be wrong. What a horrible app you've made for Android users. Switching promptly to Spotify. Bye!"
14052,Apple Music,Ess Barboots,2,0,"Pauses frequently on S8 during play of both online and offline content. Happens when connected to different cars, BT speakers and AV receivers. Once paused, you need to open the app to press play. As I typically use this type of service when driving, I will not be renewing my subscription."
14053,Apple Music,A Google user,2,2,"Using on a Galaxy Note 9. since updating to Pie I am not able to download any music anymore. partner has an iPhone and we have a family subscription. I have tried all the usual, restarting, uninstalling, sign in and out. cannot get this issue solved. It's got to be easier than this. Looks like it will be a single subscription for us. I will have to move to another streaming app. Apple seems totally uninterested."
14054,Apple Music,kalimat tijjani,1,1,"I think you need to fix this bug, I get to play only 1 song,and after that no song is playing,I downloaded more than 10 songs and only 1 is playing,will be glad if this app could just work fine.love apple music"
14055,Apple Music,Vedant Mundra,2,0,I cannot begin to list of glitches it has 1. downloaded music doesn't load at times 2. the music doesn't get downloaded in one command. need to do it repeatedly. 3. the suggestion feature sucks. 4. why the hell is it so slow. 5. it's okay. spotify is on its way
14056,Apple Music,Bradley Mongeau,1,3,After last update on android nothing loads. Just a white screen. EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING!
14057,Apple Music,Oliver Donnelly,1,1,Dont actually use the app. frustrating that apple made me download it to change my billing info for netflix on my new phone
14058,Apple Music,Kevin McFadden,2,0,Was pretty awesome now it just continuously crashes. its kind of hard to listen to music when it crashes mid song on every song.
14059,Apple Music,Xenobia `,4,59,"Would give it a 5 star if there was an option to download all music from library at once, and if there was a way to redownload album art as some of it seems to have stopped downloading mid picture leaving a few lines of color and then black at the bottom of the album artwork"
14060,Apple Music,Arpit Kothari,1,0,"i have been your customer since last year. however, after the update last month with UX/UI changes, the scrolling of downloaded music has been horrible. I reinstalled the app and now i am struggling to re download my whole catalogue due to this slow scrolling, lack of option of automatically downloading of library and horrible placement of the download button which results in hitting the scroll bar instead or playing the song. Switching to spotify soon i suppose."
14061,Apple Music,Salman Malik,1,3,after the latest update the app is crashing repeatedly. kindly check for this issue.
14062,Apple Music,FR,1,2,"0 stars. This app is so unstable, are you kidding me Apple?"
14063,Apple Music,Pema Tsokye Shakya,3,0,"dudes, when i download albums to listen offline, some of them only show half of the cover art?!?!"
14064,Apple Music,Shane Mason Connor,1,6,"Would be nice if you fixed it!! Doesn't download songs at all since Android Pie update. Get your heads out of your asses and do something about it!! You will lose thousands of subscribers otherwise, me included."
14065,Apple Music,Srishti Sinha,1,2,pathetic new update. the app goes blank. Isn't working at all.
14066,Apple Music,Nnamdi Nwafor,1,0,"I find it difficult to sign in and review, after inputting my debit card details, it still says ""you have not completed the entire form, yet I can't find what is left to be completed. Or maybe your 3months free is actually not real..?  Please what is the problem?"
14067,Apple Music,Dan S.,1,1,It won't play any of my new dowloads since i started my 3 month trial yesterday thru Verizon. What's the point of keeping the app for 3 months if it won't work. Thank Darwin i did not pay for it!!!
14068,Apple Music,A Google user,1,4,bunch of crooks. they accepted my monthly payment at first but then claimed I owed then the fees that I already paid them. Don't trust Apple Music. I found a better music for free and one more honest too !
14069,Apple Music,Josiah James,1,1,"I was enjoying it until it suddenly stopped downloading songs, ever since then I just lost all my interest in the app. For charging a monthly subscription you should at least be able to access all the features.."
14070,Apple Music,Mohsina Sheikh,2,0,"Works but glitches badly very often. I use this on a pixel 2. It's been going on a never ending loading screen with the renew your schooling thing, which isn't even letting me select any option. I only use this because there's more variety on it than spotify.. always glitching in some sort of way. Ridiculous."
14071,Apple Music,Emil K,1,0,"I couldn't login with 2fa because even if I got a text message with the code there was no place to enter it. Also, the login didn't work with a password manager (it just closed the login view when the pswd manager filled the info..). Sad, would've like to try it out because the app looks good!"
14072,Apple Music,A Google user,3,2,App has just been updated and it worse than it was before. Takes more than once for the app to actually open and work. Won't remember last song played.
14073,Apple Music,Jay Galanti,4,1,apple music doesn't like Android phones. keeps crashing. coming up with different errors. they have a great collection of music. not sure what happening
14074,Apple Music,Khalil Abdus-Salaam,1,0,I can't even get to my music because everytime I do the app crashes. This new update just messed up everything.
14075,Apple Music,Crystal K.,1,1,I absolutely loved this app when I had the iPhone. But since moving to my android it's not worth the money anymore. it's always buffering songs I have downloaded to my phone and the radio never works.
14076,Apple Music,Jordan Valenica,2,0,"Horribly inconsistent somedays it will work fine then it will just grind to a halt. Downloads woukd stop working, streaming would constantly stop and the app crashes atleast once a day. You would expect an Apple product would just work it really doesn't i shouldnt have to sideload version 1.2.1 just to get this app to work constantly. Take your money and give to spotify or google this isnt worth it."
14077,Apple Music,Yashvi Gada,2,2,"Even with a 4G data connection on a recently bought android phone with a 6GB Ram, nothing seems to load on this app more than half the time. I just search and wait for ages and nothing loads. I'm so frustrated about this, I'm not paying for this subscription to spend more than half my time waiting for everything to load. The app also hangs a lot. Please make this app better for Android users, I never had these problems with my previous iPhone."
14078,Apple Music,Jacob Cudnik,1,8,"This Android version of Apple Music needs a ton of work... I've had countless crashes, app-breaking bug that stops playing the next song in your playlist after a few songs are played, playlist images don't properly load from the cloud, and it seems they don't care to fix any of these issues anytime soon or ever for that matter. What a waste of a subscription service for Android users. The app on iOS is a little less broken but still lacks so many features that should be standard."
14079,Apple Music,Aziz Anvarov,1,0,"How can you release an app that lags, freezes and crashes all the time? Connections timeout for no obvious reasons. Downloads interrupt even tho I didn't press stop or something. If you're looking for a good service - go along with Spotify. You won't regret."
14080,Apple Music,A Google user,1,1,"always buffering, can't download or listen to music offline. every time i try to play a song it tried to make me enter password over and gets stuck on the screen. don't buy. get a free app"
14081,Apple Music,Victor Sifontes,1,4,"I had downloaded about 40GB of music. The app crashed when I tried to create my first playlist. It wouldn't let me download anything else. I restarted my phone and all my downloads where gone. I'm done. I'm not going to start from scratch again. FIX IT, Apple!"
14082,Apple Music,Snehil Singh,4,0,"Please add the feature to play next directly from the current playing queue, dragging each song to the up is not very convenient."
14083,Apple Music,Kirsten Madsen,2,2,"Used to work perfectly but now it pauses after every two songs and you have to manually skip to the next song and press play, only to have the same thing happen again and again. Extremely annoying and I'm seriously considering finding an alternative"

14086,Apple Music,A Google user,5,5,"Overall, I'm very pleased with the Android version of Apple Music. After signing in, my family plan for Apple Music was immediately available. Being able to launch music from Android Auto is a nice function as well!"
14087,Apple Music,finalxquest,1,15,"i would give 5*, but with this new update 2.7.1 the app randomly stops playing, i always shuffle my music, and ever since this update i can only shuffle between 1-5 songs then it stops playing my music. Ive spoken to both apple and android support and did all the troubleshooting and it still wont work. please fix this bug and i give it 5*."
14088,Apple Music,A Google user,1,2,"i pay for this service, download the music directly to my device, yet every time i try to use the app off of WiFi, it tells me i need to download my music or enable cellular data. absolutely nonsense"
14089,Apple Music,Janith Cooray,4,1,"Is it that the iOS based interface looks cheap or they've done it purposely. I looks good on an iPhone but not in android. Other than the cheap interface , performance is awful, laggy even music lags . hope the 1 trillion dollar company fixes the app"
14090,Apple Music,A Google user,1,2,it a cool app but you to get on your shhh! when I start a station from a rap song the next song will be a Spanish one. when at the beginning I was asked to choose 3 artist so that I could get the same type of genre at the very least right? wrong. the only time when I get to hear what I want is when I create my own playlist. and that fine but so much for discovering new artist to listen to. frustrating as H!
14091,Apple Music,Joseph Johnson,1,0,"Cant sign into my account. Wont let me reset my password, phone number, etc. I literally have no access to my account and Apple has been no help. I swear I don't have this problem with any other service but Apple. Can't even get them to help unlock my account."
14092,Apple Music,A Google user,1,2,"Have to download every song individualy and some multiple times. (Pixel 3 xl)Yet another Apple service going to be cancelled. Nothing of what apple makes works well on non apple kit, strange given they seem to want to see themselves as a service company."
14093,Apple Music,Ori Meidan,1,2,"What the hell? After the update i can't access my downloaded music any more. It is present in the storage of the phone, but not in the app."
14094,Apple Music,Phil M,1,1,Latest update has made it operate like a shitey old crab apple rotting away in the garden of the local peado.
14095,Apple Music,A Google user,1,3,"I don't know if the update actually fixed anything, but when I press on a song to play it, the app takes more than 10 seconds and a quick reboot to react when I tap. This is a little ridiculous."
14096,Apple Music,Rob Klemm,2,3,"holy cow, how frustrating! if you don't own an apple device, I suggest staying away. I'm only trying to use this because of stronger parental controls than other options, but 4 calls to support later, I cannot get past all issues because of bugs. this app feels like a total after thought."
14097,Apple Music,Theodore Bergmann,1,1,"It doesn't work on my chromebook. I can't even search for music, since search results always fail to load. If Spotify can figure out how to optimize their app for Chromebooks, why not Apple?"
14098,Apple Music,Leah Hupe,2,0,app keeps crashing when I try to open it or has a blank white screen with a flashing purple background. wont let me verify my student status. maybe need an update because the app has been faithful ever since I downloaded it. however I will be cancelling if not resolved soon.
14099,Apple Music,sophie Van Tassel,5,0,with the latest update the app won't let me play music. I'll push play but it will keep pausing it and wont play.
14100,Apple Music,XEmily_SeaweedBrainX,1,1,This on chrome is completely usless if you don't want to buy a trial!!!!
14101,Apple Music,Patrick Broome,2,0,"crashes all of the time after 2-3 songs. good selection of songs, and my subscription is free woth my verizon plan."
14102,Apple Music,Matthew van der Zwan,3,2,"Great app, could you please just add more sorting features, I'd like to sort my songs by recently added so that i don't have to individually select each song once the last one is finished playing."
14103,Apple Music,Ben Millner,2,0,"Was amazing but keeps crashing. The latest version off this app causes the app to constantly crash during songs playing. I have used apple music for a while now and its deffinatly the best for navigation and access for songs, but if the problems of crashing aren't fixed soon I will be looking elsewhere for a different app."
14104,Apple Music,Jessica Traverse,1,1,beyond disappointing. fantastic app when i had it on my iphone. but every 4 songs the thing keeps asking me to sign in over and over! such a pain when you're playing it in your car while driving!
14105,Apple Music,Cj Frias,1,1,"crashes all the time, never plays the next track, often cuts off in the middle of the song. waste money, they dont even have a way to contact Apple to send diagnostic messages:("
14106,Apple Music,alex gonzalez,3,0,I love apple music but lately it's been adding the clean version and replacing my explicit songs all on it's own. and it gets annoying erasing the whole album and re adding the explicit version. and it's not doing it with the full album itll be like half the album is clean and the other half explicit.
14107,Apple Music,Yvonne Lester,2,1,"I love this app, but I cannot stand that I have this app downloaded on my S10+ and it keeps skipping throughout the song. Can't even enjoy the songs without them sounded awfully remixed. Please fix!"

14109,Apple Music,Daniel Maines,1,2,The ui and quality of this app is straight garbage. I can't even view my account settings
14110,Apple Music,Luhein Lategan,3,1,Cannot download songs for offline listening on Nokia 7 Plus phone . Android P operating system. Part of Android One. Works on my other Android phones with lower Android versions. So between Android P and the app they don't like each other
14111,Apple Music,Darkstar256,1,1,"A gross amount of bugs for a paid service, this app needs to be removed from playstore and rebuilt from the ground up, i highly suggest just getting Spotify. Dont waste your time on this trash."
14112,Apple Music,Ayush Nayyar,3,1,"The app is poor in terms of performance. Even on flagships, the app loading time is insane, let alone moving around the app. Also, lots of bugs to be fixed in music playback."
14113,Apple Music,Michael Hodge,1,0,Not happy at all with this app. To me this is behind Spotify and Tidal as the best streaming service. I've been trying to cancel all day and the app will not let me cancel. I've even used my pc to try it and nothing. Wish I could give this app a no star
14114,Apple Music,jennifer poss,1,2,"constantly stops, wont let you access playlists half the time- fix it. I cant believe I'm paying for an app that I have to constantly restart after every song."
14115,Apple Music,Meni Shimel,1,0,Keeps crashing! Fix this please! I'm paying like any other customer even though I'm on android... Annoying
14116,Apple Music,Lim Thomas,1,3,"i actually have iTune playlist on my Laptop & ipod Nano. but i cant get the updated playlist on this app. What do i have to do to have this app to fetch the updated playlist from my iTune account on my laptop? btw, the app & my laptop iTune is using same account. i uses this app as i switch to Android as wife wanted my apple phone, and i still wants to listen to my playlist. But I'm not getting what i want!"
14117,Apple Music,Michelyn King,2,14,"I used to loooovvvve this app before the Samsung 9+ updated their software and then the Apple Music app updated. Now I'm considering cancelling my subscription and going with another music app because I'll be jamming to my music on my morning commute and it'll just pause in the middle of the song and take forever to play again after I press play. It's beyond annoying so I'll give it 7 days to improve! Please fix it or I'm out!!! Sincerely, An annoyed, paying customer"
14118,Apple Music,Parth Tandel,4,4,Guys I'm grateful that the app came for Android but can you guys please work on the album art thing? They are not downloaded properly when the song or the whole album is downloaded. Doesn't affects the music itself but still a complete and perfect Album Art would be great ü§û
14119,Apple Music,Mariam Khan,1,0,it stops playing after 1 or 2 songs on shuffle and its very frustrating. i reinstalled the app and redownloaded all 1100+ songs just to stop getting the bug where the song ends 2 seconds ahead of its actual stop time but now it does this. its also glitching when it shows me the album covers or deletes songs and images from my playlists. i would switch to spotify but not all of my songs carry over and i really like the cloud so i dont have to attach my phone to put music in directly. please fix!
14120,Apple Music,Kent B,3,0,Three annoying design issues: 1. No lockscreen music controls. 2. Cannot make Apple Music the default music player. 3. You have to scroll down to see whether you're in shuffle or repeat even though the screen realestate has enough room to acconodate those buttons. (Mate 20 Pro)
14121,Apple Music,Nosipho Khanyile,3,1,I love the lyrics feature. It was a great music streaming application until I realised the offline music still doesn't play without data and unsubscribing was very difficult; it took me weeks at R200 worth of bank charges.
14122,Apple Music,A Google user,4,1,"Its a great app, it has all my songs from my iphone 8 on here but when I hit shuffle to play random songs it doesnt actually shuffle the music and it keeps pausing after 2 songs. if you can fix this Ill fix my rating to a 5 star."
14123,Apple Music,Daniel Veal,2,1,"Why can I not manage my subscription on the app? everything I try and do to click on the ""Manage Subscription"" option does nothing...every option works. Its like you dont want me to unsubscribe!"
14124,Apple Music,Varun Moka,1,0,I have taken a subscription because I have macbook air. But the app sucks on Android(one plus 6t). Crashes very often. The Playlists dsnt show up sometimes. It's very disappointing. I like iTunes but given the app performs so badly on Android. I'm having second thoughts now.
14125,Apple Music,Russel Jandrt,1,2,FIX THE APP..... ALL I AND MANY OTHER PEOPLE ARE GETTING IS A WHITE SCREEN WHEN WE OPEN IT!!

14129,Apple Music,Robert Doeleman,2,0,slow app. creating an account fails. the modal boxes keep disappearing. its impossible to setup an subscription.
14130,Apple Music,A Google user,2,0,After the trial period as much i like songs selection & sound quality i cannot make myself to countine the subscription with Apple music as the application having constantly crashing and yet have been provided via Google Play store and yet Apple with all its resources it not doing any good with its sparing updates. Maybe the support is not there for is Android users. Even dark theme is not supported in the last update and yes the application still crashes all over. 1 star for the update support
14131,Apple Music,Anthony Swieneicki,1,1,terrible lay out constantly crashes . the suggested artists are nothing i lsiten to. the radio feat is not what id expect. all around garbage. google play is really nice smooth and its suggestions are spot on with what i like the raido stations haclve excellent choices.
14132,Apple Music,Luke Darnall,1,1,AWFUL!!! Ihave cancelled this service it has continue to bill me 14.99 and 7.99 every month i cancelled it again and once again im billed i have emailed customer service and have and have never recevied anything back! I will NEVER use anything related to Apple agin!!!
14133,Apple Music,RaccoonAct,3,0,"Hmm, I like this service, but the app is slow and filled with bugs and glitches it's seriously annoying. Also, there was a built in equalizer, but it was replaced it in an update and it now uses the system's equalizer, which for me is trash."
14134,Apple Music,Sarah,1,1,canceled subscription I have cancelled my subscription and I'm still being charged for it. have tried to login but wasn't able to load the app. please help.
14135,Apple Music,A Google user,1,1,they keep taking monthly payments but i cant open apple musix on my.android. i can download but it wont open. CASH COW
14136,Apple Music,Raj Sakhrekar,4,2,Great app. Would be better with a dark themed UI. Sharing within the app could also make it better. One complaint is that many small artists' songs are not there.
14137,Apple Music,Netta T,1,1,"The app was working fine on my Note 8 but now since I downloaded it on the S10 I'm experiencing stops & freezes where I have to force close. This is my main music app, please fix these bugs."
14138,Apple Music,Marie Grace Badua,1,1,poor if you sign out you cant your purchases unlike the iTunes before once you download you can see all song you purchased even you sign out
14139,Apple Music,Iroghama Osasuyi,3,0,"AMAZING LIBRARY, but more work and improvements needed. Still far behind compared to other streaming apps with respect to user experience. I for one will like an option for continuous suggestive song playing at the end of a playlist, an album or just one song as it is on SPOTIFY AND YOUTUBE MUSIC."
14140,Apple Music,Sidharth Singh,3,0,Good but playlists are bad. There is also a bug withmy notification card not working. I cannot change or pause songs from the Notification or lock screen on my Honor 8. The bug exists since many updates now. I am really disappointed in the app qulaity for android given that it works so well on Apple products.
14141,Apple Music,Ric Def,1,0,Between the Samsung s9 update and the latest app this has really been a big let down. I can't download anymore so clearly once I lose any internet I can't play any music. Not happy as I pay for app through ee add on who have been no help what so ever along with apple who say I just have to wait for a new update. THIS NEEDS FIXING NOW BEFORE WE ALL LEAVE FOR SPOTIFY OR DEEZER
14142,Apple Music,udayan dharmadhikari,3,0,been a long time apple user recently switching to android. good to have all my music collection on here as well. but the sound quality of the android app is poor. it sounds extremely compressed and louder than the other music app. i think an update can fix it.
14143,Apple Music,Keenan Hurlburt,1,1,"this is a cheap attempt and making an alt to spotify. i honestly hate it, but it comes for free with my service provider, so i use it. apple clearly cannot even make basically itunes work. terrible."
14144,Apple Music,Dom,1,1,app no longer works since I updated my phone - keep getting a blank white screen.
14145,Apple Music,Lamont Bell,1,0,"Not Apple's standard... well maybe. Typically Apple, has Android app but doesn't support Google Cast. Should give 1 star just for that. App is buggy as hell. it sometimes doesn't play, and other times it only play one song out of a playlist. App is soooo out dated."
14146,Apple Music,Andrew Quintana,5,4,"Recently switched from iPhone to Android and have been kinda surprised how low quality the music apps have been so far. I honestly did not want to use this app because it would a. require I pay $25/year to apple to buy iTunes match, and b) because I wanted a no compromises music player. I tried every single one of the ""best android media players"" and have not liked any of them. Many of them are unnecessarily complex, a lot of them just didn't play nicely with my music library, and over all they just don't feel polished.  I love music! I love to have my large music collection with me: rain or shine; data or no data; good days or bad. There were a lot of things I hated about iOS, but the music app wasn't one of them. I like the way it keeps large collections organized; I like the quality of the search functionality; there is a lot to like about it.   There is also a lot to hate about it. And thats what sucks about the state of media players on Android! The one I liked the best in the end was VLC, but it wasn't all that pleasant either. If I find a better MP3 player I'll revisit this post, but I think if you have a large music collection, and music means a lot to you. This is it"
14147,Apple Music,A Google user,4,10,"2 things I think could improve this app: a. On android, it would be better to let the user set preference for artists to get a better curated experience, especially with new music. more than half of new ""music"" i dont care for. b. It would be great if it had a on/off toggle for continuous play feature where you can play a song and it continues to play other songs of that same style/genre. Lastly, since the last update, there has been some noise in the album covers for some albums. Please fix."
14148,Apple Music,Muhammad Aufa Sabili,1,1,"I'm using s9 still App crashes a lot, can't download any music, and downloaded music can't be played without internet connection. If it stays like this, next month I'm switching to spotify"
14149,Apple Music,Phantom Lily,1,1,"Since a recent update, I haven't been able to listen to music that I had not already downloaded, and I can't download any new songs. If you're going to charge people for a service, those people should be able to use it properly. Fix it, please."
14150,Apple Music,kiyoshi,1,0,not cool apple :(((( i tried using it bc of its user interface i did everything and everything was set but when i tried to play a song that was a problem as it loaded and paused i tried to play but it paused again i did every tip i got frm searching on YouTube and google but nothing worked so sad as i had high hopes for it
14151,Apple Music,A Google user,1,1,I can't get any of the music to play what's the point of me downloading this app and pay for a membership if it doesn't work. I've tried to get a hold of customers support and you guys aren't answering me and I'm quite honestly pissed.
14152,Apple Music,tim russell,1,2,This app crashed within 12 hours. Within 24 hours it quit working all together

14157,Apple Music,Kayla Donn Richardson,1,10,"I can't get the app to stop auto playing in my car. It doesn't matter if I've paused the music, closed the app, or force stopped the app. Even if I've got my Google Podcasts app playing, Apple Music force stopped, turn the car off, and turn it back on; Apple Music starts up again. I""ve emailed support, but I'm 30 seconds from uninstalling the app and giving up on Apple Music."
14158,Apple Music,A Google user,1,0,"The app is pretty clunky and won't download music for offline listening, also my existing downloaded songs won't play when the app doesn't have an internet connection so it's effectively giving me LESS music to listen to then I when I didn't have the app. Go figure."
14159,Apple Music,Raul Almaraz,1,0,Please FIX!!! My screen starts to flash back and forth from a white screen and the screen to verify I am a student. I have indeed verified I am a student. App can not be used because of this. Please release an update!!!

14163,Apple Music,Rene Pons,2,0,"A buggy mess. I got this app when I came back over from an apple product and it's just a huge buggy mess. Crashed all the time, open in what ever page it felt like, and for some reason closed when ever I tried to download music and Bluetooth at the same time."
14164,Apple Music,seeker2kjw,1,7,"F#&%! garbage. 6 tries with 2 email addresses. Received verification code and after i enter it, Im instructed to go to customer support with no explanation for the error or error codeüò† Apple must not like Android users"

Not available on googe home or alexa in india. Please add a cast option. Hate trying to connect bluetooth all the time. Life should be ease. Apple music makes these simple things difficult. We are not in the google ecosystem as google forces us to. Its just that it makes it worth it. Apple should do the same."
14166,Apple Music,Brandi Davis,1,0,Typical Apple with more ways to make money. You have to pay monthly fees to share music you already purchased across your devices. I don't have to do that with Google Play Music. That's why I don't like Apple. Big thumbs down for money grubbing Apple.
14167,Apple Music,ViV,1,0,"Just wanted to get the music I bought when I had an iPhone back. But the music I already purchased is locked behind a $9.99/month paywall. Thanks, Apple. Once again you prove that you only care about your money, not your customers."

I have 111 apps installed in my phone and none of them are worse than this app. I guess I could expect this for using a apple product on a Android platform, where apple does not care about improving the Android side of it.."

14170,Apple Music,dEAfT0nE93,2,2,This is definitly a marketing scheme to get people to want this app so bad then coming to the conclusion that it does not run like it should so the peoole with android phones go ahead and buy an iphone apple want their money bad....
14171,Apple Music,gadget few,4,2,"Getting better and much more stable now but still lacking parity compared to iOS on key things. For example, I still can't use Ratings to rate my songs as I can with iOS. That's what most of my Smart Playlists are built upon. Also can't swipe in from the list to go back in the menu (i.e. to get back to Playlists, artist etc), which is a more minor detail but something I was used to with iOS"

14174,Apple Music,Brian Murphy,1,4,"This app disappoints me. It came with my phone providers plan for free. first day using it, nothing but issues. after 2 or 3 songs, stops playing. than asks me to login. It's annoying. I'll stick to Spotify, far superior to this junk"
14175,Apple Music,A Google user,3,0,"I find that the app takes roughly 20 seconds to load before I can play my songs and I can assure you this is not a problem on my side, along with the issue of certain albums claiming to be unavailable even though I can listen and download fix these issues and the app should be up to par with it's sibling version."
14176,Apple Music,kanak khandelwal,1,0,this app sucks! i have only downloaded this app because i was subscribed to apple music! but i can't download music on this useless app. i Don't know what i am paying for because there are thousands of apps for online streaming. starting focusing on quality.

14190,Apple Music,Megumu Jansen,3,1,"Its good to see that Apple has a version of its streaming service on the Android platform. As a long time iPhone user who just switched to my first Android (Pixel 3), this app has made the transition seamless. Unfortunately i have experienced major issues: 1. Sometimes when I play a new song, it stutters and I have to restart the app for it to work. 2. Sometimes the music that is listed as downloaded won't play w/o internet. 3. Sometimes, music won't download. 4. Battery drain!"

Ever since then, from Thursday evening to Sunday evening, I can't download any songs. It will just stay in the download queue. However, after Sunday evening, I will be able to download songs. I have done all the troubleshooting steps that could be done (including factory resting my phone). This has been happening for the last 3 weeks. And it's very frustrating."

14201,Apple Music,Pravar Saran,4,2,"the last update was really good, updating the look of the app and also solving one of the biggest problems where it was difficult to delete songs from your playlists as you had to find the song in the whole thing...but even now the fact that you cant sort the playlist with newest songs on the top is a big big thing missing and stopping the app from becoming great..."
14202,Apple Music,Aaron Rice,1,0,"Garbage on android. I get it for free from Verizon but it's such a headache it isn't worth it. Always buffering, have to put my password in every 15-20 minutes, won't play songs that I downloaded in the app. Please fix."
14203,Apple Music,Tim D.,3,2,will not download songs for offline listening just continued to say downloading until you stop it. Thirty minutes and still not downloaded is ridiculous. Used to work fine on my pixel 2 until last update on 1/24/19. please fix this problem or don't say that you can download songs to your phone when they only stay in the cloud.
14204,Apple Music,Timothy Martin,1,2,"Honestly, it doesn't even deserve one star. Apple is quite a big company, so you would think they could design an app that works, but not. To be fair, knowing Apple's history, I wouldn't be surprised if it was purposely designed to be the worst possible way to play music on an android. Briefly, it sucks. It has one job, and it barely does that. A complete and utter waste of money, I would have expected better from apple."
14205,Apple Music,Daniel Felix,1,0,"The app's music is ok but it's functionality is the worst, always stops working, the playlists won't respond from time to time, to the point that can't be even modified. For iOS might work, but for android is complete garbage."

14209,Apple Music,Chris Smith,2,0,I just decided to give apple a go even after all those bad reviews. Well after installing and all thise huge lists of licencing etc finallt got into the app. I can now attest that it deserves the poor reviews.. Its clunky slow and generally not a great design . seems just like itunes on a PC apple only does these thibg to convince me to but an apple product.. uninstalling
14210,Apple Music,Gaia Aspitz,1,1,"Every single time I scroll down on a playlist or even just my list of playlists, any time I try to download multiple things at once, etc. the app crashes and restarts at home or just quits altogether. In addition to that, songs will play normally and then after a few songs, or sometimes just one, the song ends and the music stops playing. For no reason. This has absolutely nothing to do with my settings, I've checked. Absurd that Apple would let me spend so much money on an app that doesn't work"

14271,Apple Music,Shahil Magar,5,8,"i use this app in samsung s8. it used to work very good before but its been 2,3 days i cant play the music, whenever i try to play the music it buffers and paused by itself. please fix it."
14272,Apple Music,ilyas arif,3,10,"I think they have yet to fix the issue on samsung s9 phones after the android pie update. My other phone, samsung s7 edge still works fine running on android oreo. Please please please fix the bug on s9 because I'm unable to download anything for around 3 weeks now!"
14273,Apple Music,A Google user,1,10,Cannot download songs to device. I have followed every guide but there is clearly a fault with the app. Lots of users reporting the same issue.
14274,Apple Music,Pranav Gupta,4,1,Best recommendations and personalised playlists! The music gets paused when I take a call in between but never resumes on its own. The search bar is disappointingly slow in response.
14275,Apple Music,Elan Kirshenbaum,2,1,"Constantly crashes. I know Apple always makes non-Apple versions of apps/programs not as smooth as their Apple counterparts, but this is getting ridiculous!"
14276,Apple Music,Liv Barton,1,0,"Loved apple music at first. This app has so many problems. forcing me to sign in over and over, not playing music, wont allow me to download... what good is a music streaming app that WON'T PLAY MUSIC? back to spotify for me."
14277,Apple Music,A Google user,1,2,paying for a service that doesn't load. only brings up a white screen.
14278,Apple Music,Don Hayes,1,2,its still not working. on the android phone. Even after the update
14279,Apple Music,Carlos Ruiz,1,0,app constantly stops playing my music after a few songs so i have to pull my phone out of my pocket to press play again app sucks on android it was legit on my iphone
14280,Apple Music,Eptihal Rpeah,1,0,"Good day,  I am a university student and I verified that by unidays but when it came to Visa you rejected my card even though you took 1 USD twice and I couldn't  continue my subscription.  I need your help thank you."
14281,Apple Music,Kyle Herman,1,0,Was using a free trial on my android and wanted to join in on the family plan we already have for the iPhones and cant join. Says my browser isnt supported. Didn't see anywhere that you couldn't or wouldnt have wasted my time.
14282,Apple Music,Alec Frazier,1,1,"music won't play on android. it just keeps pausing and won't ever play. works on my iPhone, but it doesn't work on any of my Galaxy phones."
14283,Apple Music,Christy Bristow,3,0,"it's a good app but it keeps stoping, freezing up, and sometime won't show any of my songs in my playlist. it also just stops playing the music for no reason. please fix and I will change my rating. thanks"
14284,Apple Music,Ty YANG,4,4,"here's what I found working for me to download music, you just need to turn on ""content restrictions"" from setting page"
14285,Apple Music,Illya Slobozhanin,1,1,"It seems, that QA and Engineering departments don't work at all in Apple. Last two updates -> app don't started. Customer orientation on level."

14287,Apple Music,Brayden McGraw,3,1,Apple Developer Review I am a Apple Developer and i have nothing but issues with apple music on my android device the app keeps changing/restarting songs in the middle of the song and i have to hit play all songs i cant pick the song i want this needs to get fixed ASAP i will be filing a report with Apple Engineering as well
14288,Apple Music,Martin Harvey,1,0,"downloaded this app onto my note9 512GB, so brand new with ample RAM to run apple music. It won't log into my account at all and keeps crashing. app is not worth wasting memory on, all other apps are running perfectly. dont waste your time and effort"
14289,Apple Music,Abigail Rae,5,4,"Idk why people are complaining because this works great for me. Sure, it costs more than Spotify, but I really just want a larger collection for music. I can view my downloads while offline, I can see my library, it doesn't even buffer. I don't even have a phone that has impressive specs (a Vivo Y69, a pretty old model, mind you) and it still runs smoothly. So maybe it's got something to do with your device if the app doesn't work well."
14290,Apple Music,Yerramsetti Sri Harsha,2,1,"not fit for Android, really slow, and full of bugs, i don't know why they bothered to release it for Android if they didn't want to maintain it"
14291,Apple Music,John Jones,1,1,Its stops playing my music and I have to reopen the app to start my music over and over and over to much Please fix It stops when I use my bluetooth and when when I play music on my phone
14292,Apple Music,Henry Sam,4,90,would give a 5 star rating but every now and then when fast forwarding songs it will stop playing. and other times the app crashes other than that it is a very great app love it.
14293,Apple Music,Akash Das,1,3,Gets progressively worse with every update. What's going on? Doesn't matter if I'm streaming or playing downloaded music. It takes forever. Sticking to it for the availability of music. Can't wait for Spotify yo get here.
14294,Apple Music,John Gerald Gagatiga,1,0,I recently downloaded some songs and videos but none of them except one plays offline. Why is that? I mean it says that my downloaded file size is 555mb but none of them plays. Hope you'll fix this.
14295,Apple Music,Cody Hansen,2,0,"After the last update, it stops after a couple of songs and you have to hit play again. Perhaps Apple could make their files compatible with a more modern and advanced media player like WinAmp from 1999."
14296,Apple Music,Vrasto Adjie,1,1,Can't even login with existing apple id because can't input the verification code that given on the apple device. Where I can input the verification code? Because no pop up window to input it.
14297,Apple Music,A Google user,1,2,You are not allowed to listen to songs you already purchased or even music already on your phone without giving up your credit/debit card information.
14298,Apple Music,Silver to an Extreme,5,1,"Apple Music is the best, for my uses. Many use Spotify for song recommendations, and while I used to do that too, I don't use an app to find songs. I find songs normally by just coming across them in life. So, in my opinion, Apple Music is great for keeping music and organizing it into playlists. I use a Galaxy S9 and I've never run into problems with the app, even using it on the phone I had before this one (a cheap LG), so I think that (normally) you shouldn't come across any problems."
14299,Apple Music,Mohammad Abusaleh,1,0,"Probably the worst streaming music service I have used, the UX is horrible, it allows duplicate songs in a play list, but when you remove one it removes all of them.. Doesn't have options for song quality except high quality on cellular."
14300,Apple Music,Luis Rangel,1,103,iTunes won't load. when app is opened it remains as a white screen.
14301,Apple Music,shanu reddy,1,1,highly disappointed . once for 3 times it will stop playing and you people are not taking care of it. we are waiting for spotify to step in india.
14302,Apple Music,Josue Zarca,3,3,"this app would be great but I am having a problem downloading my songs offline everytime I press download it says downloading but when completed, it's like nothing ever happened. Please provide me with a solution to this problem..."
14303,Apple Music,Kaushal Mehta,3,0,despite being the library with an epic database it fails to deliver the smoothness in Androids. i have to re login everytime i shuffle a song. it is pissing me off. fix it. ffs. i am paying for this service. !
14304,Apple Music,Leo Mikaelson,2,3,Great service although app isn't working great on the mate 20 Pro. Clearing data and login issues. After working as a product tester and application developer these are small things to fix that will then make the app 5 star
14305,Apple Music,Nathan Scanlan,3,0,"they've fixed the problem with the music not being able to download for offline use. This still doesn't excuse the length of time it takes for issues to be resolved on this platform, Especially for a subscription service."
14306,Apple Music,Ivana Contreras,1,0,it used to work just fine now I cant go through 2 songs without the music stopping and me having to close the app and reponen. üò°üò°
14307,Apple Music,IJSC 5700,4,0,it was good until this last update. my app keeps closing and the music is sputtering even for my downloaded music.
14308,Apple Music,James J,1,1,for the past couple of weeks the app has not allowed me to play any music!
14309,Apple Music,Harold Pureco,2,0,"Everything works okay, but it feels somewhat slow, even on high-end devices."
14310,Apple Music,Rob Richards,1,0,"Like all things Apple this app is totally useless. can I give it zero stars? I logged into my account, but none of my 15,000 songs that I pay an annual fee for to keep on the Apple cloud were available. I was asked to pay a monthly fee to access a library thst I have already paid for. Just another reason (and there are many) why I'm running away from this demented organisation. Steve Jobs would be rolling on his grave."
14311,Apple Music,Donna Maree,1,1,"over the years, I've spent $00's purchasing music, mostly via iTunes cards. Now, Apple have decided to become subscription based. Which means I now have to pay again to access my already purchased music! Trying to resolve this, apparently I have ""hidden"" purchases on my account, which I'm unable to access. This is just double dipping and rorting and an extremely bad joke! If you purchase music....get it onto an external drive. Learn from my expensive error."
14312,Apple Music,Vinion Coda,2,7,I must separate the apple music service from the apple music app. Apple music gets 5 stars. Id happily keep my subscription if not for how bad the app performance is. The music app has poor memory management. Perhaps develop a lite version thats isnt that resource hungry. Although I suspect it has alot to do with file decryption and better cant be done. Anyway fix the sluggishness and you got a new customer.
14313,Apple Music,A Google user,1,0,"Galaxy S9 - The app has alot of issues for being an apple product. I can no longer search for music, artist, or album to play. App crashes frequently or stops responding. Cant download music at times for offline use."
14314,Apple Music,Lois LePard,4,0,"After the last 2 updates on 3/26 & 3/27,all I get is a frozen white screen.Please fix as I'm a paid subscriber."
14315,Apple Music,Tinaya Ventom,1,0,it was fine until the most recent update I'm tempted to stop using it and go with another music streaming service
14316,Apple Music,Sgindiri,1,0,despite any updates it is still crashing....needs to be fixed. this is pathetic.
14317,Apple Music,Rhys Gecse,1,1,app will freeze during playback after latest update and you have to force stop to get it working again
14318,Apple Music,Ashley Jackson,1,2,BS it won't even allow me to download a account so that I can check my gift card
14319,Apple Music,flyxxxl s,4,1,"The new version seems a lot faster and stable than previous one, but the EQ option now is missing, hope it will not be permanent cause its really useful("
14320,Apple Music,Brandon,1,1,not sure whats been going with apple music but its been stoping every other song instead of playing threw the list.It also will play a song I dont play and I will keep clicking a different song and it plays the opposite song.Apple music has been acting wack latley.Its been so fustering considering I pay for it.
14321,Apple Music,solitary crab,1,0,"I hate the new update. I am an Android user, and the built-in equalizer was removed with the latest update. When I select the equalizer (using the updated Apple Music app), it will automatically go to the phone's equalizer but it won't let me personalize or change the equalizer to my prefered sound/genre. It will say ""only valid for music"". I'll probably switch back to Spotify."
14322,Apple Music,Julianna Hernandez,1,3,"Horrible app, constantly crashes and signs me out. I haven't been able to get through a single playlist without restarting app and signing in again."
14323,Apple Music,Mikayla Gunsallus,1,0,I just downloaded this app and cannot play any songs (Samsung S7). Very disappointed in Apple. I've had no problem with Amazon or Spotify. Waste of money. I recommend YouTube Music.
14324,Apple Music,Nehal K Patel,3,2,"just a few quirks that seem like theybwould be easy to fix to give it 5stars.... easier way to sort (like how do you find a particular song if all songs are in order of when they were added....i did find away aroudn tbis but involves itunes on a laptop but still doesnt auto sort) also i keep getting ""Something went wrong"", or music just stops playing on its own from time to time. (saw a previous review saying this may be do to older phones....im on a Note 9)"
14325,Apple Music,Aryan Raskar,3,1,I can't play any music online and offline. The app crashed and now it's not working properly and its totally useless at this point. Please fix this.
14326,Apple Music,SiRvWiLLiAM,3,0,"constantly skips like a CD player and crashes often , would love to have these issues addressed."
14327,Apple Music,Jacob Bush,2,3,The app won't download songs. Once I updated to Android 9 it's just not working right. Fix that issue and you're more then 5 stars.
14328,Apple Music,stevenrama,1,1,"Apple Music is BROKEN After Latest Android Update, you can stream the music but that's it. If you try and download a song for offline play it will forever be stuck in an endless downloading cycle that never completes. I would wait until they fix this before giving your money to Apple. Until this is fixed the app will be getting a 1 STAR rating."
14329,Apple Music,M Raymos,1,2,I have seen reviews saying only Android phones with small amounts of RAM have issues. Well I have a new Galaxy Note 9 with 6GB of RAM. I have been using iTunes for years but whenever i try to play songs on a playlist one don't will play then nothing. I press play again and the same song plays. If I hit next it will go to the next song and that will play then nothing. It works fine on my computer in iTunes but not on my phone. I can't continue to pay $10 a month when i can't listen to a playlist.
14330,Apple Music,Tyler Barnes,2,0,I've used apple music since it's release on iPhone and when I switched to Android over a year ago I kept it for the sake of convience. The UI looks nice and clean but it's become very unreliable and even if the app is not crashing it still won't play music...
14331,Apple Music,A Google user,4,2,really good but as some problems like music doesn't want to start or it only plays for 2 songs
14332,Apple Music,A Google user,1,2,tried multiple times to set it up over several months then gave up.
14333,Apple Music,Meryl Pritchett,1,2,"Can't access music, I'm just stuck with a screen that says ""can't connect to server"" eternally."

14335,Apple Music,martin Lb,5,1,glad iTunes is on andriod now! I got the best of both worlds! android phone and iPad pro tablet
14336,Apple Music,Rainier Rademan,2,1,"Unable to download music with current version. Still love the wide variety of music, even though the look and feel is getting a bit dated, and the interface lacks some functionality. Cannot fault music quality though, and the algorithm that recommends music is pretty good too, although not great yet."
14337,Apple Music,Jason Mills,1,0,Clunky as hell. UI is slow and cluttered. I only downloaded it because I get it for free through Verizon. I will be going back to Google Play Music. So disappointing Apple and Verizon.
14338,Apple Music,Jill Doyle,4,2,"I would give this ap 5 stars,but quite recently it started to automatically stop playing if i forward through songs. This is a recent occurrence."
14339,Apple Music,Chris Godinez,2,0,"The latest update purged all my downloads and when I contacted Apple care about it, they seemed to care very little. Similar thing happened on my apple device last year with the same response from Apple care."
14340,Apple Music,ÏïÑÎØ∏Î•¥,1,4,After the last update it's impossible to download the music. please fix this bug ASAP!!! But overall app is really great.
14341,Apple Music,A Google user,1,0,"I wish i could give a higher review, but on my Moto G5S the app won't load. It's stuck on the first screen, the one with the white background and the music note. Really unfortunate."
14342,Apple Music,Doom Hydra,4,1,"Please please god, add more features! This would be perfect if only it had the volume leveling feature of literally every other version. Why would you not include this? Please add it back. I have a lot of quiet songs and changing the volume every time it gets to a normal one is extremely obnoxious."
14343,Apple Music,Yacov Vazan,1,0,"I truly do not understand why the app could not be used just as a music library, why do I have to pay for Apple services, like the downloading of millions of songs. Can't it be like the iTunes version for PC computers, where it's possible to use it as a music library, and if I'll decide so, I'll pay for the whole pack?? If that would have been an option, I would not even rate one and lonely star. sorry friends"
14344,Apple Music,DeAndra Traylor,3,0,"app crashes multiple times a day, i have to restart it. i like the large catalog of music when im able to listen to it. im an Android user and i hope apple understands that we enjoy music as well."

I can't load any of my library much less search for a song to try to re-download it. Needs to be fixed, I've sunk a lot of money into iTunes and I had to cancel subscription due to money issues at the moment."
14350,Apple Music,A Google user,4,1,"Love this app, At times though it stops running. Also with this new update, I can't seem to locate the EQ anymore for android setup. Overall good"
14351,Apple Music,Kayje Newton,1,1,"I loved Apple music, but now I am switching to Spotify, the app in general is full of choice, but currently it is full of bugs that causes the app to crash often, playlists play 3 - 4 songs then stop, having to be restarted numerous times which became tedious. Clicking on songs to download takes many attempts and it's disappointing. It's slow, buggy and currently not worth the subscription fee. I am done. I expected so much better."
14352,Apple Music,Mehul jain,1,2,The apo crashes too often.. rather it won't open only at the first instance.

14364,Apple Music,Nassir Ali,3,11,The user experience needs to be on par with that on iOS. The placing of the menu button at the top left is highly user unfriendly especially on larger screens offered by Android phone makers. Ill advised choice.
14365,Apple Music,Ricky The Great,4,1,Free with Verizon top data plan. Kinda buggy. Weird interface. Weird ‚è≠Ô∏èsong algorithms. Not fit for auto play. Great forüëÇto entire Albums. Lyrics search is great. Not bad but still not done cooking.
14366,Apple Music,A Google user,1,0,This app actually used to be good. For the last few months it hasn't been downloading or adding the bands that I add to my library. If it doesn't change I'm going to be ending my subscription to this.

14376,Apple Music,Carlo Miranda,1,2,"I really wanted to give this a chance. I tried it hoping I could use this well with my iPad, but nope. UI is confusing. If this app was supposed to convince me to switch over to iOS fully, it has failed miserably. It plays music for the most part but its hard to use and just plain unreliable. I really wanted to like it and really tried."

14384,Apple Music,American Rap Critic,5,1,"I respect Apple because they pay more money than anyone else trying to get content correct for their fans. They have actual people where automated systems could never keep up with your favorites and charts. Then, you're already paying your favorite artists for a simple 10 bucks a month, and with customized playlists of anything you want from artist callections to the broaderr and more deliberate ""bangers compilations"" (favorite here) Apple hands you your soul in music... Affordable and Perfect."

Have never found out any new songs with this app, so it speaks about it's really bad discoverability features. If you want that try Pandora or Spotify's Discover weekly. Or just read magazines and newspapers. Lastly, really buggy app on android. Loading is very slow. Manytimes songs would be playing but there would be no sound. Restarting app fixes it, but it's annoying."

15646,Apple Music,hisham ali,1,1,Very bad asking for money
15647,Apple Music,hugo verjus,1,0,can't use the app because of pop up
15648,Apple Music,Ruben Virtucio Jr,1,1,"it was good selection of music and had some (minor) issues working it off an Android. but since this past weekend, I can't even play any songs. I select a song (doesn't matter if it's my library, browsing, using my data or Wi-Fi), nothing happens at all. I can go in the app to browse albums, see top chart, see my library, but when it comes to playing a song, nothing happens. very frustrating and annoying that I haven't had music to play."
15649,Apple Music,Sara Prieto,4,206,"I have been using other Music players prior to trying out Apple Music and its not bad. There are definite pros ans cons. Pros: My music automatically syncs to my cars Bluetooth, or at least faster than other music players that require you to have the app open. Smooth design. Has More music choices. Cons: I wish there was an option to add a song you like directly from the notification bar. There is no gapless play option to smoothly transition to the next song."
15650,Apple Music,Christogur D,2,2,the start was great! over the ensuing months the app began to fail. i can't download any new music onto the app. it just doesnt download. its not very user friendly as well. for example - to add a song you like takes a 3-step process where they could have had the '+' symbol just below song to make it faster. i can't understand why i cannot download new music
15651,Apple Music,Calvin Soo,2,12,"Was working ok before the update. Now there's just a tiny squeaky sound instead of music. I thought it was an issue with my mobile, but turns out Spotify was working. So does Joox and Deezer. Noticed that it's an issue with the equalizer. When it's off, no problems listening with a BT speaker or earphones. But it becomes squeaky with the equalizer on. What's up with this Apple? Disappointing!"
15652,Apple Music,Nick Pena,5,0,"The only real question is ""Why is AcidRap by Chance The Rapper not on this!?"""
15653,Apple Music,sagar bhanti,3,3,"ive been using apple music for 6 months now...the app is great overall... however, i do face problems at times. sometimes when i select a new song, the song just doesnt play at all. i keep pressing play, but it just wont play. i dont know what the issue is but its very irritating whenever it happens. sometimes the lyrics wont load and sometimes i just get logged out randomly. if something could be done about all this, it would be great!"
15654,Apple Music,Nkosibonile Ndwandwa,3,36,"This app has taken away the ability to play music from folders. I also hate the fact that I had to search hard fro my library, it is a small button right down there. Why does Huawei update it's music player to this and not enable us to use all it's features in South Africa? Beats me! Bring back my ability to play music from my folders."
15655,Apple Music,Brandon Short,3,54,I don't know if it's because I have a pixel or not but my main gripe is that I can't download music. It just acts like it's gonna download but it never does. And I can't cast my music to my Echo. I can with any other music app. Other than that the app is fine. Not great but it's usable. It crashes every now and then but it allows me to finish listening to music exactly where I left off so it just requires me to press play again.
15656,Apple Music,D V,5,2,"If you're an owner of an iPod classic, if you have transferred hundreds of cds that you love to your iTunes library, if you have songs that were in your iTunes library that aren't readily available to you now for purchase (and why would you want to anyway when you already own them), iTunes is is definitely for you. It took a couple of days, but over ten thousand of my songs were uploaded to the iTunes cloud and I now have access to all of them. Finally, I can put my old iPod classic to rest."

I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app 4 times now. and i need to rebuild the playlist all over again! whats the point of it? only reason this app is working here cause spotify is not available in my country."
15662,Apple Music,Andy Dewey,1,2,"what a waste of time, I've just spent the best part of an hour trying to sign in with my apple id, all i get is it going back to sign in page. All i want to do is listen to some stuff I've bought on iTunes over the years and it won't let me get past the 3 month trial page, very annoying. I know i have the correct password as if i try a different one it prompts me that it's wrong. Can't sign in, sign up or use it. waste of time. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling twice now and still to no avail."
15663,Apple Music,Zachary Smith,1,1,"A completely rubbish app, and this is the 2nd time I'm trying it over a few years. UI is sluggish and unintuitive. Sign in barely works (had to restart to see that I was signed in). Your iTunes library, I.E. The songs you have purchased from Apple (and that they have presumably already made a profit from you on) is behind a monthly subscription fee. And I'm never sure if I'm about to sign up for a monthly subscription to apple music accidentally. Basically this app, as 'free' is just an advert"
15664,Apple Music,theodore deegan,4,13,It's. Ok though you need to jump through so many hopes to get to things. When I want the list of new releases I don't need to see. Anything but the new releases than all the things before I find the list. Just put the whole list on my new releases and I wouldn't have to jump through hopes. Damn you still don't know what I like after all this time.
15665,Apple Music,Dmitriy Tartynov,1,4,Every music streaming service has the same stupid UX mistake. You just can't remove a song from any playlist from the current song screen. This is terrible. Some moron made it and all other morons copied it without thinking. It's such a pain to manage a collection of even a hundred songs. Even Apple did the same. It was my last hope.
15666,Apple Music,Githin Manesh,4,219,"Great quality music Please bring more features like 1. Like or dislike a song while playing a station on lockscreen. I've seen that feature in iPhone apple music, but it is missing now 2. A long term played music history will be very helpful. A proper history with date and timestamps can help to recollect the titles of songs heard long ago. please bring this feature. 3. A dark/night mode. I usually play music during bedtime, it is very hard for the eyes without a dark mode. 4. Sleep timer"
15667,Apple Music,Sajid Np,1,1,The experience I'm having with this app is really screwed up. I always trust Apple because I've been using iTunes to organize and play my huge list of music in my windows PC. I was so impressed that I went to an extreme end to purchase it. But you disappointed me Apple. The 'add to library' mark is greyed out most of the time. And it reappears after a while. I'd really appreciate your effort and give it a five star rating if you could fix it somehow and make my life easier. Thank you.
15668,Apple Music,Jason Saylor,1,20,In short... This app is garbage for Android. Works amazing in my iPad. On wife's iphone. But on a Galaxy note 9. Garbage. Period. I'll be paying for Google music instead. This app just takes eternity at times just to load. Crash errors and force closes consistently. I've uninstalled. Reinstalled. All apps and software up to date but no good. I can't help but think apple does isht like this on purpose. There's no reason for the buffering. No reason for the delay. Wife's iphone and mine are on the same service provider and my phone is MUCH NEWER. Same location. Exact same time and mine can literally take up to 5 minutes to load... Infuriating and not worth my $15 a month... Move on
15669,Apple Music,A Google user,1,0,since upgraded to os pie has become a huge nightmare of app and I own a Samsung note 9
15670,Apple Music,Kevin Bustamante,4,0,UPDATR - So I finally got it to work. man such a hard process. anyways it works now. So far I havent even been able to listen to one song! I hit play and it plays about 3 seconds and skips. Really wish i could listen to some music! Until apple fixes this I'll be listening to Pandora!
15671,Apple Music,Sheldon D'Silva,3,11,"Apple Music App is probably the worst sounding of all music streaming apps for Android. Can hear a major difference between Google play, Amazon Music and others. Also you will hear a small clip or static sound when streaming or even listening to downloaded music on this app. Makes you think there is a problem with the earphones, but it isn't true as other apps don't have that interference. Only need to use it as I just moved over from iPhone to Android and have alot of music in my Apple music library that I would like to access. If these issues aren't resolved I will have to chose to unsubscribe and move over to Google or other options."
15672,Apple Music,Tyler Whittaker,3,79,"I have a Galaxy Note 8. I've had Apple Music for about 3 months now and it has been working fine, minus a few app crashes here and there. However, for the past two weeks I havent been able to listen to any of my music. As soon as I hit play it pauses the music right back. Obviously, this is annoying especially since I am paying for a subscription. Anyone else having this problem?"
15673,Apple Music,Mark Cassidy,1,0,"poor app, poor playback. app stalls, fails to open."
15674,Apple Music,Luis Cruz,1,1,I'm so sick and tired of the password problems. I have both apple and android products and it always gives me a problem logging in. Then tells me I can't use passwords that I've used before and makes me constantly change them. I spend money every month to use a service I can't even get access to. It's a damn music app I don't care if someone gets my password. S annoying
15675,Apple Music,Edward Baker,1,35,"Get Spotify! This app is glitchy, sometimes the music skips, often when I connect to Bluetooth I need to restart the app several times before it'll actually play music, I click on a playlist and the music starts but often I can't see the actual list of songs. I have Spotify on the same phone and data plan with none of the above problems."
15676,Apple Music,Jessica V,1,27,I was excited this existed since I bought a lot of music on my iphone when I had one. So after downloading it and signing into my account I was deeply disappointed when they told me I have to pay a subscription to listen to the music I already bought. What a terrible choice they made to implement such a anti consumer policy. No thanks uninstall and one star for me.
15677,Apple Music,Steve Clarke,1,1,doesn't work. play stop play stop.
15678,Apple Music,A Google user,1,0,it was working perfectly for me untill the equaliser went missing....
15679,Apple Music,Jeb Beard,1,2,"gui terrible, app won't play music on my moto g5. Verizon gave me a free account to apple music. Too bad it doesn't work. Anytime I hit play it just stops, app doesn't crash, it just doesn't play. User interface is the ugliest, most cluddered gui I've seen for any music service app, or any app for that matter. When asking to personalize genres and artists it forgets all the info i added. Apple, you suck hard. What happened? A ""no star"" app for sure."
15680,Apple Music,Mykola Cherkunov,1,16,"App doesn't recognize if song is downloaded on your device and try to play it from the internet. The only way to listen downloaded music from your device is to turn off the network, close player screen, close album/playlist, reopen album/playlist and start the song. After that you can turn on the network. So damn easy to use."
15681,Apple Music,Jane Fitzgerald,1,2,It practically requires a blood sample to sign up for this site. Then they totally ignore all the favorite artists you have told them you like as well as the types of mysic you prefer. I have been a member now two weeks and have yet to hear a single piece if music from the dozen favorite artists I registered with them. Do yourself a favor and do not download this horrible site.
15682,Apple Music,Kaiser S√∂ze,2,1,"Very often refuses to play anything, even songs that have been downloaded locally. It seems that the app checks with the Apple servers to see the status of your subscription before starting to play, and sometimes the servers don't respond. Forcing stop the app sometimes helps, but sometimes it doesn't. It's very frustrating. I won't renew my subscription"
15683,Apple Music,jelima 123,1,19,"I thought I'd be able to sign in and have my iTunes account music sync to this app but it doesn't. I have a lot of good songs in my iTunes account but I don't have a computer to access them. It would be nice if there was a way to have an Android app for iTunes so I can have my iTunes library/music on my phone. I'm not interested in using two different apps, Apple Music and iTunes, to get music from the same source."
15684,Apple Music,Akash Das,5,669,Awesome app same experience as on iPhones just login with apple id. No need to create new playlist or sort in library. It'll load all songs from library. Just one annoying thing is that you need to click download beside every song no option to download all songs in the library with a single click. I recommend it to every iPhone user who started using Android. As I have both the devices. It doesn't mess up your song library or playlists.
15685,Apple Music,Damone Murray,1,0,garbage. songs will not play even if i download them first
15686,Apple Music,A Google user,1,3,Rubbish. Won't even open
15687,Apple Music,InDiGo MaKaRa,2,0,"worked pretty well when I first got it, but for about a month now I am unable to listen to more than one song at a time unless its downloaded. I am also unable to download new music, even though I have a payed subscription. Most likely going to undownload the app when my subscription is over."
15688,Apple Music,Jake Gibbons,1,59,"Always freezing skipping and crashing, so frustrating. Very lucky if I can listen to one full song. Listening to music is supposed to be a cathartic experience, but whenever I use Apple Music I just get annoyed. Only reason I will keep subscription is I can manage my library in an offline desktop experience with iTunes without having to keep my computer on and online all day."
15689,Apple Music,ANANT SHIV,4,0,Finally the UI is same as iOS and overall exoerience is getting there too.
15690,Apple Music,Dan Wilson,4,58,Idk why such a low rating number for this app. Im about 2 weeks into using the app. So far i am very impressed. The sound quality is solid. The music selection is awesome and im loving the huge variety of playlists. My only issue is sometimes when i skip a song it skips two songs. Not a big issue but kind of annoying.
15691,Apple Music,Shofiul Azam,1,40,"I cannot believe a giant software company like Apple would ever make an app so bad. This app is literally a port of iOS without this iOS. Very clunky slow and the app is full of bugs. I cannot tell you 1 session where I played music and didn't encounter a force close or random pause, so touch sensitive you cannot even scroll through your music without it being long pressed. Full of bugs this app and a company who build a reputation on optimization, not much has been done here. Literally garbage"
15692,Apple Music,A Google user,2,36,"Overall the application is ok but can be better: 1. Theme should be customizable to black color at least. 2. Should provide user the ability to choose stream and download quality when using wifi. 3. Provide shuffle feature, how can i listen to a playlist if i know the order of all the songs, makes music aweful. 4. Does not provide music based on previous music history. The main reason people pay for music apps, is so that they get introduced to new similar music based on previous song list."
15693,Apple Music,Matt Lester,3,7,The app is great to use but what I don't understand is if you have gone from apple to android as I have ehy changing you password is a huge pain if you forget. It sends a message to an old apple device that I don't readily use. This causes more problems than fixes. Why not send it to my email address like everyone else?
15694,Apple Music,A T90,2,1,"Kinda wild, the play button loses its functionality. You press play on the song, there's a quick loading sign then nothing. This suddenly started happening out of nowhere after using the app for 2 months, now everytime I wanna listen to music I need to uninstall the app and reinstall it and sign in and all cause it seems like the only fix so far, won't be for long tho since I'm running out of patience, one day I'll uninstall and keep it that way ‚úå"
15695,Apple Music,SIOIN MAK,2,3,"The app works perfectly on ios. But when it comes to Android phones, the download become extremely unstable. There's always an error occurred when I downloaded some music, it's shown as downloaded completed, yet the music file can't be played. Not even delete the downloaded and redo it again method can help with this situation."
15696,Apple Music,Jose Hernandez,1,2,It simply doesn't work. When I press play it doesn't do anything. i got Apple music because of the great library but there is no point in paying if I can't play any of the songs in it. I contacted support and all I got was an automatic email saying they don't reply to emails. worst service ever. Apple stealing money from their customers as usual

It asks me to enter my password on payment page and despite entering correct password it's still saying invalid credentials. I even tried changing password still it's says invalid password. I'm fed up with this. Could you please look into it ASAP. I believe there's a bug on Android app.

15701,Apple Music,Andrew Holman,1,0,The buggiest Android app I've ever used comes from the richest company in the world? why even bother if you're going to phone it in this much? my favorite thing about this app is that it needs an internet connection... to play music you've downloaded to your device. i wish i were kidding

15709,Apple Music,Kevin W,1,1,"This app is a buggy, horrible mess. Too many bugs and bad experience. I hear it's better on iPhone, maybe so, I don't know, but I DO know this is hands down the worst music app I've ever tried.

So why bother let users download songs if Apple Music barred us to play without internet connection? If this problem cause by bugs so naturally it should be address by various updates that already rolled out,but it persisted.

When I found out by my iPhone user buddy that AM was on the play store, I had to cop. I know spotify is podcast-centric but all such content (I wanted) can be accessed via other platforms. I wanted AM for that signature apple userability and Beats1. It's good but Android users are definitely shorted. I see my buddy's iPhone interface and their AM has a bottom side bar to quickly flip between library, for you, etc. For us android users, we must hit the icon on the top left screen. I'm always listening to music, especially, on the road and this is a big misstep. Please fix and I'll go 5 stars and never contemplate going back to spotify again lmao"
15731,Apple Music,brian gordon,2,440,This app is hot garbage on Android I'll be unsubscribing to the service after my trial. The music selection is ok but half the time the app doesn't work. Slow loading and downloading and app crashes it's not worth it IMO Spotify performs better. I know apple wanted to make more money by opening this up to Android users but nobody buying an iPhone to use this. Apple needs to fix this.
15732,Apple Music,Philip Faudoa,1,3,"I think it's an outdated app along with any apple product. There should be no reason why you're holding this to dislike the song, and clicking this to skip songs. And the fact that it doesn't move on to the next song after disliking a song is just stupid. This app makes it hard to drive and control it at the same time."

Aura Dione has a few older songs that cant be found on apple music as well. Those are just two examples out of many. If they had every song available it would be the BEST music app ever.
15738,Apple Music,Daniel Schmitt,1,7,This app is garbage. I just got a brand new note 9 and have connected to my brother's family plan subscription to save a few bucks. It will not let me download a single song and I've gone through the settings to make sure all permissions were on. Spotify never gave me any issues. Going back to it.
15739,Apple Music,Sariza Krog,1,1,after update not working anymore
15740,Apple Music,Samantha Irons,5,1,fab I use this on my Samsung and it works great.
15741,Apple Music,Kurt Gunderson,2,4,"I moved from an iPhone to a OnePlus 6 abandoning my extensive library of iTunes movies and music, or so I thought, before I found this app. Then I found out that I have to PAY Apple $9.99/mo for the privilege of listening to the music I purchased on iTunes. Ugh. Never again Apple, never again."
15742,Apple Music,Burke Arnold,4,0,iTunes is the perfect musical product. *****
15743,Apple Music,Nitish Ahuja,2,1,Can't use downloaded music when offline!
15744,Apple Music,Michelle FT,1,4,Pointless... this is not a mobile version of iTunes even though it's from Apple and the Google store directs a search for iTunes here. You cannot purchase music or see your iTunes purchases here. You'll have to use your computer for that purpose of iTunes and load your purchases onto your mobile device from it.
15745,Apple Music,wayne martin,1,2,"not actually sure of the point of this app since apple dont seem to be paying any attention what so ever, just shows how apple have turned into a make coins not joy compony. i got this music app because its free for 6 months on ee. good way to get customers. and its free, as in you dont use data on it. hmmm sounds good to me, however, on my phone ( p20 mate lite) THIS APP DOES NOT WORK, cant play a single track, not one, just skips over them, dont waste your space and time. get a different app"
15746,Apple Music,Afshyn Jinnah,4,11,"I don't know if it's just me, but when I play a song and exit the app. It makes this weird noise while still playing the music. I love sound quality and this is making me reconsider using this app rather than Spotify. FIX THIS ASAP. im not paying money to this service if it's not fixed"
15747,Apple Music,Sahil Chachere,5,0,best ever music experience. no clutter. apple proves every time why it is best.

15749,Apple Music,Lucifer Jones,3,2,"Things they should do to make it better. Firstly, introduce a dark mode ! Secondly, app is super buggy... The player randomly pops up in the notification panel. Thirdly,the whole downloading tracks could seriously some attention. Some tracks stop mid way and I have to click on the download button again."
15750,Apple Music,Evgeniy Zonov,2,12,"Unfortunately, that app simply not downloads music via mobile data! Why did I installed it? Just to have my apple music library when I am not at home. And it does not work correctly! Disgusting, apple, just disgusting. I think it is reason to cancel my apple music subscription."
15751,Apple Music,John Padfield,1,14,"Music choice isn't as good as you expect. If you're someone who listens to music regularly it becomes a pain in the arse to use. Several times recently it can't even load my downloaded music, whether or not i have internet. Genuinely not worth it. Queuing music is total garbage."
15752,Apple Music,Lee Gillies,3,1,"Fantastic library of music, very simple to use i normally use shazam then find it on apple music. The only complaints i have is you will find that a song that is on a playlist just wont play and you get a message pop up saying its no longer available, no explanation or notification just one day it wont be there. My biggest moan and reason i havent given it 5 üåü is i pay for the family version so you can register more than one device however you can only use 1 at a time which is quite annoying."
15753,Apple Music,Cory Wiebe,2,7,"The new apple updates do not work with Android updates. I'm not able to download music at all, which is the main way I listen to it. Also it doesn't have a lot of settings options. It is the way it is and you can't change it. IE you can't have the music start again after connecting to headphones or Bluetooth."

15758,Apple Music,Maurice Smith,1,8,This app is f****ing trash when not used on an Apple device. I'm pretty sure Apple does that intentionally. The app will constantly freeze and no longer play unless the phone is powered down. It becomes a pain after a while. Time to switch to Tidal or Google Music.
15759,Apple Music,A Google user,5,1,I like it. It works great on my android.
15760,Apple Music,A Google user,1,1,Anything Apple on non Apple products become the buggiest piece of junk imaginable. Constantly fails to play songs and apple music with the app is hilariously bad. This is pure garbage that leaves me wondering why I keep giving them money.
15761,Apple Music,Richard Kalmick,1,0,I have had no Idea that I was even paying for this app
15762,Apple Music,El Dinero,4,0,the audio is amazing but it glitches sometimes an most of my cover arts are weird
15763,Apple Music,WirdFoil,5,2,"I think this app was great. I have an iPhone but when I'm using my tablet I love to listen to my Apple Music selection. Maybe there are a few glitches or two but in the end, it's just my device. Great job Apple, you did perfect. Bad job Android, you broke my device."
15764,Apple Music,Christian,1,5,"Worst music streaming app. Been a user on Mac forever, but this is a joke. Still crashing and freezing. Bluetooth not working correctly. Have to reconnect various times in order to get it working. Hey, I'm paying for the music! Please overhaul this completely!"
15765,Apple Music,A Google user,1,1,"Won't even let me sign in. Even after resetting my password it constantly says it ""has been entered incorrectly more than once"" and forces me to change it again. Completely useless. I was going to move to Android from Apple but if I can't access my music I'll be staying where I am."
15766,Apple Music,Brigitte Brammer,1,1,i put my cd collection on itunes on Windows for me to listen to privately. Now im trying to listen to the same collection of my cds on android and im expected to pay for my own collection because only then you will sync my private collection. You just want to take my money for a collection that does not belong to you. üò†

15772,Apple Music,Jess Mayers,1,7,"my family has apple music and on all their iphones it works perfect but of course it does not work at all on Android (i wonder why) i get it, android is their competator but my family still pays for the service. Should have the same application and proformance no matter the platform. Music sometimes stops and the app crashes, songs just don't downloaf and even songs downloaded will sometimes have issues playing. ive contanted support many times about this issue and no improvements have happened."
15773,Apple Music,CJ's tech advice,5,1,The newest update was the absolute best
15774,Apple Music,Annita Eleanor,3,6,"Adding friends is so unnecessarily difficult. When you Google how to add friends so many options appear but in the app only connecting Facebook is available. Furthermore, the app seems to prioritize beauty over efficiency. Ex: when tapping the playing artist it results in another screen of clarifying whether or not you want to see the album or the artist, unlike in Spotify where the two have their own specific buttons."
15775,Apple Music,Rachel Brandner,1,4,Do not get this. It does not allow you to access or play music you already own. The app tries to get you to pay for Apple music so you can listen to what you already payed for. Personally I want access to my old music without having to buy an apple product but that option seem highly unlikely.
15776,Apple Music,krishna sethi,1,0,I paid for app and my music isn't playing. :(

15785,Apple Music,Juan Franco,1,12,"IM SWITCHING TO SPOTIFY .im disappointed. i love the layout, the music on here and many other features about this service. That said, this app has become a trojan horse for MALWARE. its super BUGY and it FREEZES constantly. I've stuck around for about 2 YEARS hoping these issues will be solve. SADLY NOTHING HAS CHANGED. i will UNINSTALL and SWITCH TO SPOTIFY"
15786,Apple Music,Sheshadri Deshpande,1,1,The music quality is great. I just switched from ios to android and I dont have sorting based on newly added so its kinda frustating. plz add this feature and it feels like they didnt want the android app and still developed it any way.
15787,Apple Music,Christian Jeronimo,2,10,Tons of issues still with the apple music widget and audio quality when the phone is locked. I often have to close and reopen the app to eliminate distortion. Even more frustrating -- still no built in cast feature. I'm switching to Spotify because of this very reason.
15788,Apple Music,Jay Saini,2,6,Application is simple and fine but have few bugs and also manage sound bar is missing on the main play screen which is present is iOS app. Mission alphabetical scrolling bar in right right of play list. Most of the time app need internet connection to play offline songs üôÑ. When playing using Bluetooth device if we go away from device music didn't stop and started playing in phones speakers. Hope developers will fix these bugs in upcoming updates.
15789,Apple Music,Chris Gallegos,1,0,"I always hear from Apple loyalists how amazing Apple is. This is my first try and the app is terrible. Won't play the music in playlists you choose. Sometimes if you uninstall it then add it it will work for a session. Won't let you manage your membership within the app. It may be the worst app I've used. I expect things to be reliable, intuitive and easy. This is none of the above. plus no fingerprint entry. Just awful."
15790,Apple Music,Safia Adem,2,0,"I have not been able to play music or even download on Android 8.0, with no firewall and strong Wi-Fi connections. They have designed a poor, slow app for Android, which is such a shame for a huge billion dollar corporation, that the entirety of their efforts are for iOS users while neglecting a huge portion of the music market in Android users. Really didn't want to use Spotify, but have little choice. Very unhappy, especially for taking my money every month and I received nothing."
15791,Apple Music,Delfin,1,13,"I have had to uninstall, remove music downloads, and re-downlod everything one song at a time, only to have this app tell me that I can listen to my downloaded music because I have no internet. I don't know what has caused this but it's really pissing me off."
15792,Apple Music,Johan Frederik Anker,3,3,"Good app, does what it needs to, but whenever I try to download something the download doesn't start, it just stays in the notification tray & nothing happens. Please fix this. For now I need to restart my phone each time, which is super inconvenient!"
15793,Apple Music,A Google user,3,3,The radio sucks. It hasn't reached the levels of Pandora where it recommends similar artists unless it is for Ed Sheeran and the likes and you can't find certain artists. For a paid membership they should work hard on improving this. Otherwise other app subscriptions might be more the money.
15794,Apple Music,Miss Angel,5,9,"The best music app, bar none. I have used literally every paid music service like this; from the radio-style ones like Last.fm and Slacker, to the better playlist-style ones (Pandora, Deezer, Spotify, XBox Music, Play Music, Tidal, Apple Music) Apple Music has always been the very best- had it always been available on the Play Store the way it is now, I would never have bothered trying those other services. Music selection is always greater than the others, and the GUI is simple & easy to use."
15795,Apple Music,Kevin Dsouza,1,0,Well after this recent update I can't play any music :/
15796,Apple Music,Ilona W,1,6,"On Android, trying to set up account payment, but whenever it goes to verify, the load stops and nothing happens, tried to go into payment information in settings to set it up, same thing... just a blank screen. That's fine, guess I'll keep my 10+ dollars then."
15797,Apple Music,Arif Khan,1,3,Was good initially. Now the DRM updates actually killed all the fun. I am wondering why the f i am paying 2 dollars every month for an app which requires me to be online always to play my song list. The amount uf i had spent in other apps i could have purchased favorite album or songs. ...and on top of that now message comes in pop up sayin content not authorized to play..some error 12452.. Utterly useless. Will stop subscription this year end
15798,Apple Music,Phillip Stringham,1,0,"inconsistent streaming. full data and songs cut right in the middle. spotify does a much better job at pre-loading songs in queue. nothing is more aggravating when you're jamming to great music, and it stopping in the middle of the chorus. if you're going to have a music app, keep it consistent. you could at least get rid of that annoying loading bar, it doesn't even look like it's loading anything, just emphasizing how terrible this app is edit: I didn't pay money for a crappy experience."
15799,Apple Music,A Google user,1,3,The app won't let me sign in even with correct login info and verification code. I have tried over a dozen times with all the correct information and uninstalled/reinstalled the app but still nothing. I'm paying $10 a month for an app I cant even use!?
15800,Apple Music,Goldie Locks,1,0,"You have to pay a monthly fee to hear the music you already purchased just because you don't have an iPhone. I can understand a charge for radio, but not for your own Playlists. Apple please do better by your customera of all phone preferences."

15804,Apple Music,Abhijeet Prasad Dash,5,0,great one...quality of music above all music apps ...the best
15805,Apple Music,Hafsa Hayath,1,0,the last update made the app so smooth. now its back to glitchy üôÑ
15806,Apple Music,Jared Chamblee,1,103,"Price is competitive but features and curation pale in comparison to other big services. After a certain update the app refused to play on my phone, I cancelled service in the app only to discover apple still charging me a month later. Absolutely skip this app, no reason to use it over Spotify or something else."
15807,Apple Music,Denise Vissepo,3,42,"Every time the app updates it crashes somehow. I like it because of its variety and convenience, but the absurd amount of bugs is awful. Especially while paying monthly for the thing. Right now i can't even play my music no matter the resets to app and phone."
15808,Apple Music,Chuck Dries,5,4,"It's surprisingly good. I just switched to android from iPhone, and given apple's reputation for iTunes on windows being hot garbage, I was sort of expecting the worst. Not so. This app is fluid, feels native, plays nicely with android auto, and works reliably. Nice work apple."
15809,Apple Music,Daniel Michael,3,121,"The collection is great for the price and the suggestions are good sometimes. But it does the basics so poorly. The app has been regressing since mid last year. When I try to play a downloaded song, it buffers for while(which it shouldn't anyway) but then it gets worse. It just doesn't do anything after that. Only a restart solves this issue and again after a while the issue comes up. So sad, for an otherwise decent app."
15810,Apple Music,Dave Cadorette,1,0,music not downloading. others are reporting same problems since update
15811,Apple Music,Abhinav Lohia,1,0,Android app of apple music lags way too much!!!

15813,Apple Music,A Google user,5,7,Finally! The update I needed.
15814,Apple Music,Roman Salviano-Main,5,0,Would have given 5 star if the subscription I payed for worked at all. What is the point of paying monthly when I can't listen to any music except for what I purchased years ago on iTunes? Edit: They fixed it so I changed rating from 2 to 5 stars.
15815,Apple Music,Lizzie Brown,2,3,Worked really well until my subscription ended. I was happy to continue using music I had purchased (prior to the Apple music subscription) but it won't let me see it without subscribing! I paid for those albums and can't listen to them unless I use my old iphone.
15816,Apple Music,Matthew Lonis,2,0,"Coming from iOS...this app is just absolute dog s***. I don't know how they can't manage to make it run smoothly. It seems horribly bugged. Developer, if you're reading this feel free to ask for my input and I'll gladly email you everything I've noticed wrong compared to the iOS version and I'll gladly help point out bugs I notice. But for regular people if you're looking for a new streaming service or coming from iOS just don't expect this to be any semblance of quality you'd think Apple could acheive."
15817,Apple Music,Itumeleng Sekhabisa,1,0,"Does it work on Android, I'm disappointed. I downloaded the app and subscribed but I'm not getting the worth or the joy I was hoping for. On the specs, it caters for Android but on the functionality it doesn't. The forever 'something went wrong' msg whenever I try to download or listen to the few downloads in having its really frustrating. I only get to use the app once after a very long time of trying and it stalls and never plays again. This is frustrating, even support doesn't support"
15818,Apple Music,A Google user,5,0,great. use it on my spare nokia 2.1 while i keep my iphone away.
15819,Apple Music,Keenan Staple,1,46,I've used the app for a week and have barely been able to listen to anything due to the same loading issue other reviews have mentioned. You select a song and it doesn't even begin to start streaming with no explanation. In its current state it's not fit for purpose.
15820,Apple Music,A Google user,2,0,The Apple Music doesn't fall from the three.
15821,Apple Music,A Google user,5,0,"Apple Music may not have as many users as Spotify. However, we all know that the only reason for that is because it's by Apple. This app has a much larger music selection, there are bands on here that I can't even find on YouTube, letalone Spotify. It's easy to use, everything is organized nicely. All around a great app. I highly reccomend."
15822,Apple Music,A Google user,1,0,Does not work on my Galaxy S9. I have been to Samsung and Apple and they say the issues has to be with the App. I install and re-install and the Apple Music logo appears but there is no Apple music menu or access to my library. I have family membership. My family ca access but i cant. Anyone else having issues? No one seems to be able to sort out the problem.
15823,Apple Music,Nathan Deutsch,2,1,"App is nearly glitch free but on some albums will only play from first track for some reason. Very limited search history. Very poor search accuracy for classical music: Providing combination of search terms, including composer, opus number, instrumentation often seems to ignore search terms in top or all results - - frustrating despite good availability of music."
15824,Apple Music,Olivia Reynolds,1,0,"This app doesn't even deserve one star. I got a giftcard for it so I decided to try it out. Don't. I can't download any songs, and when I try a stupid pop up pops up and asks if I want to pay every month for the app. No I don't thank you very much! I have a guft card, let me buy songs! Don't get this all, don't pay apple more than you already do."
15825,Apple Music,Elizabeth Smith,3,0,apple app. is not linking up to alexa?
15826,Apple Music,Joshua Mousir,5,1,had to log out than back in
15827,Apple Music,Mayohn Alalasundaran,1,1,I was given this free for 6 months so took it up. Initially okay but has got worse. Music lags and breaks up. Playlists don't update so when you click a song it plays one which is either a few above or below it. I wanted to give the app a chance but it's just been so poor. I'm now cancelling even though it is free because it has been that bad. Going back to Spotify which has a much better UI and streaming quality and consistency and is far superior. Pretty lame attempt by Apple.
15828,Apple Music,enyiekan ekukinam,5,0,"Currently in Nigeria, and I can't subscribe with a debit card. 90% of Nigerians shop online with debit cards not credit cards. It's how we pay for services on Google play store. Work on that, because I want to be able to buy music on iTunes."
15829,Apple Music,Krysta Marie Zalas,1,0,"I used to love this app, but it stopped actually playing music on 12/24. I have spent the past week uninstalling and reinstalling, as well as trying different things to get it to work. The app opens and loads, allows you to select a song, etc., but it does not play. It just keeps going back to showing the play symbol. I'm really disappointed that I can no longer enjoy my music. *Editing to add that I use it on a Note 9. in case anyone knows of a fix."
15830,Apple Music,NAGI IBRAHIM HAMID,3,0,the beats 1 live is not working after the update in Malaysia please fix this
15831,Apple Music,Donatas Gembeckas,1,1,"the app keeps playing up, everytime a song starts it starts at a lower volume, then every few minutes the volume will start going up and down! plus i get this weird notification sound every few minutes, never happened before! its an android device and works fine with everything else"
15832,Apple Music,jallia jacobs,1,0,yall update and now ALL MY MUSIC PLAY LIST ARE GONE
15833,Apple Music,Lee Davis,4,0,"Fine selection, and it works every bit as well on Android as it does on IOS. It would be nice if there were a way to move downloaded music to expandable storage on Android devices so we could save space on our phones and tablets. I can see how this may seem redundant with the streaming of music but let's face it -not everybody has perfect reception everywhere and many people who go through non-contract service could very easily have a data cap that at best bottnecks their connection speeds. This can make Apple look bad due to their streaming service not streaming due to frequently buffering. And for those who have a data cap that shuts off their data once they've reached a small limit of data then the streaming service is useless because they cannot stream the content -again making Apple look bad. This can all be avoided by allowing the downloaded music to be saved on expandable storage improving the users experience with Apple services and there fore improving Apple's image. Do I actually expect the notion of Apple allowing the use of expandable storage? Not at all really. But this is my review and I do think that that the feature of allowing the downloaded content to be saved on expandable storage would vastly improve the experience especially for those having to use a lower end device."
15834,Apple Music,Flying Dragon,2,0,"The app seems to have trouble auto-playing. Even the shortest lapse of internet connection will cause the whole playlist to stop playing. Having it stop midway during work is very annoying because it's a process to get it started again...for a couple songs before it stops once more. Otherwise, its good but the problem is so bad that it drags my score down."
15835,Apple Music,Goat Lips,1,2,"I just want to purchase music tracks from the iTunes store from my Android, but there's no option to buy, just wants you to buy their music subscription service. I will now proceed to find the track I wanted lying around on the Internet and get it for free. Stupid."
15836,Apple Music,A Google user,1,12,app worked great in the beginning. now on my google pixel 3 it keeps pausing and doesnt play new music.. Apple support said to contact google for the issue however this is an apple app..what is google supposed to do? apple music app developer needs to continue to update it to make it compatible with other phones.
15837,Apple Music,A Google user,1,0,"Can't download songs you've already bought without paying for them again. I was under the impression that with this app I could sign in to my account with apple and transfer my music to this device. But there is no way to do so, besides paying for a three month subscription. the free three month trial is almost insulting, as if I haven't already paid for my music. So dissappointing. I would rate 0 stars if I could."
15838,Apple Music,Vedant Saraff,3,4,I use apple devices so I downloaded this app to keep my music library synchronized but the downloaded music from my library gets deleted from the phone. The music is available in my library but I have to listen to it online. Please fix this bug.

I live in New York City and we have a lot of Subways for transportation. a lot of the stations are underground.... I'm so fed up with this app.
15841,Apple Music,Julian Conde,1,3,"This app is terrible. Not optimized for android and have been locked out of my account. In order to sign back in, an apple device is needed which I dont have. Since then, I have been charged for the subscription and support refuses to help."

Their Android app experience keeps getting better, but as of now there's a bug which breaks the whole app - at random times, songs refuse to play.

I would happily give a year of my life to not have had this experience. I hope it doesn't happen to anyone else."

I dont need ad free and I dont need Apple radio, but there is no option for that, its pay a monthy fee or you dont get YOUR music."
15848,Apple Music,Martin Mize,1,1,"downloads are super easy, but why waste time downloading music when it appears that if you cancel , you lose access to everything you download. if you log off, it also deletes all you downloads and you have to download them all over again."
15849,Apple Music,Robert Via,1,1,"I don't have an iPhone. I don't like them, at all. I am a movie person and some of the movies I buy come with a digital ""watch anywhere"" specifically for iTunes and I can't access them with an android phone or tablet. Not even in desktop mode."
15850,Apple Music,Divyansh Devli,3,4,Too many bugs . Could have better playlists. But toooooo many bugs . The same app works fine on ios . Please apple improve this app. Apple products were always different. They would stand out. A lot can be done to improve this app.

15853,Apple Music,Patrick Reilly,1,0,"Haven't used Apple products for a long time. Verizon now offers free Apple music with unlimited plans. Upon trying to update my credit card information so I can finish linking my Verizon info to Apple, the credit card / billing address update page keeps giving me an error about how my area code can only be 3 digits and how I haven't completed the form. Only problem is, there is no where on the page to put my phone number in. I guess I'm back to hating Apple and their products. Uninstalled."
15854,Apple Music,Melissa Lowry,3,0,"Was hoping this would be better ans since I'm a long time Apple user I was pleased to see I could use this app on an Android device but it's actually worse than Spotify. Tracks aren't correctly shown on car display via Bluetooth or at all with the aux cable. Shuffle is ridiculously slow, skipping songs weirdly. And I can't seem to get the red notification number indicator to go away when I'm using the app. I'll try it a little longer but will more than likely continue to keep looking."
15855,Apple Music,Jack Rotter,1,0,"This app is so unstable that it feels like a joke. It crashes constantly and there's a ton of stuttering when scrolling through songs, albums, and playlists. On top of that, there is no trace of a button to download all songs. you have to scroll through and download songs one at a time. It is extremely frustrating and stupid that there is no quicker way to download things, especially when some users have existing libraries on other devices."
15856,Apple Music,A Google user,5,0,"Thank you for adding Android Auto support! It has made my drives much more pleasant, and I didn't have to switch to another service. My next feature requests: AirPlay/Casting - Provide airplay or cast streaming (or both). Wear OS & Tizen support - I'm using a Galaxy Watch. While I have an app that can remotely control Apple Music on my phone, I'd like to be able to load some music to the watch without having to force it into non-DRM formats and load it on there. Spotify is already there!"
15857,Apple Music,Aaron Kidd,2,0,The app used to work fine with a few minor hiccups. Over the past week it has not been capable of playing a single song on wifi or through my phone data. I've already paid for Apple music this month so I'm going to hang on to the app but might have to switch to a different service afterwords. I would prefer to keep the app because I've enjoyed it's design over other services but if the developers don't want to take care of it I'm just waisting money.
15858,Apple Music,Jean-Philippe Legare,1,0,"This has got to be the worst user experience I've had with an app for years. I just wanted to play a single song, not that hard of a task for a music app... It took me 7 clicks, yes 7 not kiding, in various different embed menus and views to get to said song. On top of it all it presented me with an error when I clicked Play. I'll stick with Google Music and Spotify thank you"

15861,Apple Music,Sonia Giannini,2,0,the only good thing about this idea is the fact i can load whatever music i want whenever. BUT the kicker is the app barely works. i often have to delete it and re-downlaod. and the worst part of that is i have to redownload all my music manually every stinkin time too.
15862,Apple Music,Lisa McCulley,1,2,I downloaded this trying to download music I already paid for. It won't let me unless I pay for a subscription to access music that I already bought.... Um ok. I am uninstalling it and just trasfering my music from my computer the old fashioned way.

However, it doesn't work well with any Android functions.  i.e. Whenever a call comes in or if google maps is talking to give direction, the music pauses and do not replay automatically as it would with all other music apps like Google Play and Spotify. Widget pressing play doesn't always work either.  i'd drop out of this app but there is no other way to take advantage of the Apple Music subscription on my Android device unfortunately."

15875,Apple Music,Jarrod Goulart,1,0,I'm signed in with my account but it won't give me my music I paid for from iTunes. Apple wants to create the hotel California. If you buy iTunes music you can never leave and listen to the music you bought. They will sell you a monthly subscription though with this app but that's it. Amazon and google have the same thing.
15876,Apple Music,Fawas Mudar,4,14,Song collection is good. But it doesn't work so well offline. Also it keeps deleting songs and it's not intuitive to add songs to your offline library. Works well online but can't say the same for its offline performance

15893,Apple Music,Meet Patel,1,0,"I am currently using two devices for work/personal purpose. my work device being an iphone, I decided to keep the same music player since I have subscription on Iphone. But it seems apple is playing around with users from another ecosystem other than ios. there are tones of bugs in the application. the app seems to crash very often. While playing the songs online it would often not load the songs. I have seen a single developer music applications doing way better job. very disappointing."

So I logged in using my apple id but when I logged in it wanted to set me up with an apple music plan and charge me ¬£9.99/mo.

15964,Apple Music,Ryan B,1,1,Its impossible to find podcasts on this app yet this is the default app to buy them for many podcasts. Why there isn't a podcast feature on this thing is beyond me. They're losing tons of money.
15965,Apple Music,kaushik suri,1,1,Pathetic. Full of bugs. When I try to download songs they never do. Player pauses automatically without consent while streaming or otherwise. Utter waste of premium spent. Going back to Spotify.

15972,Apple Music,Cynthia Orbaker,3,0,Good so far. Still beginning to explore the radio stations. I waited for quite some before I downloaded the app due to the negatives that people posted. It appears that maybe the kinks are getting ironed out. I am cautiously optimistic as of right now.
15973,Apple Music,Koketso Selekana,1,0,The app is buggy and doesn't play music at all.

15977,Apple Music,Debarun Sarkar,1,1,Not at all optimized for patchy slow networks. Spotify has much better performance. Only thing going for it are the curated playlists. But then again user generated playlists on Spotify aren't bad or something.
15978,Apple Music,Tushar Poddar,3,0,"I took up apple music thinking its collection is unmatched. While that at some degree still holds, the user interface and ease of use of the app is pathetic.

Hope they improve this app."

15992,Apple Music,Josh Berry,1,0,This app is terrible. Itunes won't work on my PC anymore so I figured I would get itunes for Android instead. Now if I want to get music I need to pay an extra fee. What happened to actually buying music from artists? I do not want to stream anything!
15993,Apple Music,Elinor Holloway,1,0,I have tried to renew my subscription but they won't let me what entitles Apple to take good money and then deny their services is beyond me. is this what non Americans are to expect now? how ignorant do you have to be? anywhere else and this would be a scam.

16001,Apple Music,Raghav Gupta,5,8,Hello apple I am using apple music and will surely mention that is great or the best music app with bassboast is just mind blowing but I am facing some issues like bass boast option disappears sometimes from the menu even if I connect apple airpods to it just doesn't show up so could you fix it and please if possible let it be there always. The other is I play any playlist I have again and again toggle repeat the whole when I switch between the playlist or any song which is not in the playlist as I used play music earlier in that we have to toggle repeat once and switch between any song or any playlist that was pretty easy and simple as we don't have to remember everytime that we have to switch on repeat. That would we very nice if you can fix those issues it would mean a lot and again nice using apple music. Thanks.
16002,Apple Music,Joyce Villar,2,4,I use android and aside from the fact that a lot of songs are not available in the place I'm living in which is available to Spotify. Most of the time the app appears blank thus i can't play the music i want to listen!

16007,Apple Music,Christopher Kirkland,1,0,"Doesn't let you listen to a single song you've already paid for, but if you like being asked at every navigation point if you would like to sign up for their paid service, it's the best!

16008,Apple Music,michuki,1,0,"Apple really doesn't care about the app working for other devices. Not sure why I'm surprised. As someone who enjoys both Samsung and Apple devices, I wish they'd make an app that works for both. They won't though. So I'm gonna just uninstall and stop paying."

I was surprised to see Apple Music on the Play Store. The app is exactly the same as the one on the iPhone, and unfortunately suffers from the same occastional lags and crashes the ios app carries. Apple should fix this. Other than that, I'm happy to have my music library on my Android phone. Maybe Apple should also bring iMessage to Android (although I know that will never happen)..."

16165,Apple Music,Nash Anderson,4,1,Would rather use Spotify or Google however my family is already subscribed to Apple Music and would be a waste to have another subscribtion. Giving it 4 stats solely because it is Android Auto (AA) compatible.

16182,Apple Music,Sajeeb Adhikary,2,5,Android is awful with running any app. This specific app is simple. You pick a song and hit play. In a playlist to go to the next song you hit next. Android managed to ruin this premise. When I hit next to skips two songs. When I skim through the song it skips to the next song or minimizes. Please Android just stop pretending. This review took 10 times as long as it should have because its impossible to type on an Android. Autocorrect for grammar and spelling is just too much too handle.
16183,Apple Music,Eug√©nio Costa,1,1,"Not at all optimised for Android. It rus slow, consumes a lot of memory and battery. Furthermore, it is not intituive. I'm moving to Spotify"

16194,Apple Music,Sid Patil,5,0,Apple music is perhaps the best streaming service. The app needs to be more stable and reliable. There is a stark difference in the quality of the app on my iPhone as compared to the Android variant.

17557,Apple Music,Emma Foley,1,1,I switched from pandora to this??? I had a pandora acct with a decent amount of variation. I decided to switch to apple because there is a student discount. I figured why pay 10 when I can pay 5 for the same deal. this app will NOT stop crashing. you guys need to fix this asap. the basic function of a streaming app is to stream (unintentionally sounding like a dick) but your app isn't even doing that. I know pandora isn't great but at least it played the entire song.

17592,Apple Music,Alessio,3,1,"Two things: 1. I can't listen to downloaded music when I'm offline, which means that the music takes up space on my phone but somehow isn't there when it needs to be played (seriously?) and 2. Sometimes the app freezes and shuts down, please fix that!"

17595,Apple Music,Ki G,1,0,"For some reason I was not able to access my library and was forced to choose a plan before being allowed to look at music I OWN. The whole app is just darn frustrating. I had no way to set anything, the app kicked me out, wouldn't let me get to the library until I uninstalled and even then it kept giving me download errors. So done, I'll just keep spotify."

17603,Apple Music,Cody Cropper,1,0,"it wouldn't accept my credit card and signed me out and now that I'm trying to sign back in I cant remember my password and I've tried changing it 10 times already and it's not working, the app has a good interface but I cant recover my account for the life of me, I've tried making a new one too but when It comes to making the password it keeps telling me they dont match even though I've retyped them a thousand times! it's really frustrating!! UNINSTALLED"
17604,Apple Music,Marla Jimenez,1,0,"Since a week ago I havent been able to listen to a single song without the app crashing. Usually the app works well but this past week It has crashed more times than I can remember. I tried uninstalling, reinstalling, checking for updates on both my phone and the app. Nothing works. No matter what source I play it on (phone, car, wireless earbuds) they all crash. When you check the notification it appears as if the song never stopped playing but there's no sound. If you open the app it crashes."
17605,Apple Music,Rolivhuwa Tsanwani,1,2,"They have a great selection of music, but I hate the app. As a music player it is not easy to use in my opinion and the latest version has been terribly buggy as of late. It would be great of I could play my Apple music albums using the Samsung music app like I can for spotify"

17611,Apple Music,Holly Harrison,1,1,I wanted to be able to access the music I purchased so I can put it on a different device my old ipod broke but they changed the whole thing telling me to purchase a subscription and I can't get my music back. I have never really been a fan of Apple and this takes the cake. Now I have to find an alternative way to get to sleep at night.
17612,Apple Music,A Google user,2,1,I want thought Apple Music was a great product however this morning when attempting to use it/launch the application all I am getting is the white blank scrren and I have paid for my family plan. Seems that this priblem did not occur until the company when public with the new oroduct which is supposed to release this fall. Please advise tech support to let the consumers know how they would be affect whole you guys test your babyboomers. I also think when phone updated the app is no longer work.
17613,Apple Music,tah jian yeong,1,0,"This app is so buggy. I've been kicked out of the app more than 10 times in a single day. The app logs me out of the app and says it can't load my music library, takes half a minute to login and i have to download the music all over again once i get logged in. Another error came up telling me that I've logged in too many times on this device and it just straight up refuse to let me load my music. Dude, im paying for this service. Time to subscribe to spotify instead? it's the same price."
17614,Apple Music,David Bernier,1,0,"I don't like this app. I don't like how apple doesn't share just because you don't have one of their devices. I am an android user with a galaxy s8, pretty modern phone. Its 2019 already. This is not a negative post however, just constructive criticism because honestly apple is a great company. I write all of this because I would really like to leave alot of my friends some podcast reviews but its seemingly impossible for me to do so. I downloaded apple music but can get in, very frustrating."
17615,Apple Music,Gerson David,5,0,"what about a dark mode,, dark, just like on the mojave dark mode"

17619,Apple Music,Adrianus Molendijk,4,55,"I really love this app! The music selection is great. One feature I would really enjoy is the ability to bring a song down in the ""Up Next"" playlist to the top so that it plays next. Currently you need to click and hold the song card on the right, drag up, and wait for the list to scroll all the way to the top. Having a feature (a popup menu, or swiping right) to bring songs to the top quickly would make this app 5/5 for me!"
17620,Apple Music,Ally ƒåat,5,0,It is a great app but it takes up so much of phone storage.

Even the songs I haven't downloaded does not want to play. I am unsatisfied by this service
17625,Apple Music,ÍπÄÏ§ÄÏò§,4,0,Not bad but need to fix some bugs
17626,Apple Music,Mike RecHipHop,2,0,I just unistalled this app. This app was really amazing for the first one month I used it. After then it began to bug. I bore it untill 2 days ago when it became rather impossible to play songs again. Sometimes this app messes up downloaded album arts. Sometimes the music stops for no reason. Crashes for no reason. Adding music to library and downloading but it doesn't reflect in library The worst was when I couldn't play music again. Clicked on the songs but they wouldn't play. Unistalled üóëüóë.
17627,Apple Music,Gerasimos Makris,2,0,Add Chromecast - Android TV support/ And more playlists.
17628,Apple Music,Kamaldeep Singh,5,0,Needs more stability & performance improvements
17629,Apple Music,Flashy Ninja,3,1,Sometimes its stops playing music
17630,Apple Music,Isaac Humber,2,0,app often times will stop working and require me to log back in. Was also unable to listen to music that I downloaded to the cloud when I wasn't in a Wi-Fi zone which I found ironic. These troubles could be part because I use android opposed to Apple but I don't think this should be a problem for people that want to support a company and listen to music.
17631,Apple Music,Harry Torres,1,1,"Extremely buggy. Don't waste your time. Plus Apple removes music (without any warning) because it's not ""available in you country"". Wish I would have known before I purchased the album... In this country!!!"

17634,Apple Music,Vedant Pathak,1,2,"The app does not play music on my phone. I keep on pressing play repeatedly but the app refuses to play or even load anything. The only way I can use this app is when I uninstall and reinstall it, and even then it works only for 2-3 songs tops. I want to use this app. It's music collection appears to be top notch and it's recommendation system is probably best in class. But all of that is useless when its fails at its primary job, i.e. playing music."
17635,Apple Music,Aidan Kenney,5,0,best ting ever
17636,Apple Music,blvckvelvet,4,1,It great but sometimes it have problem with Internet connect and crashed accidentally
17637,Apple Music,ALoner Guy995,1,0,Doesn't give you the ability to buy songs directly from the iTunes and add to you Music Library. Only pay to listen to music through a monthly subscription which sucks. I bought a lot of music from iTunes and can't listen to them on the app. Give us android users that ability because there is more music on iTunes than Google Play Music.
17638,Apple Music,Srikaran Senthildasan,1,0,Worst application.. Not at all user friendly
17639,Apple Music,Ravi Dixit,3,2,"It's quite a buggy app, shuts down quite often, resumes playing music even when the BT headphones are turned off! All of a sudden stopped downloading songs on to the device! Music previously available disappeared all of a sudden! Update on 29/10/18: The above reported issues haven't been fixed, I am on paid subscription and I still can't download! Apple, are you listening? I have sent you direct feedback from the app too."

17641,Apple Music,Austin Davis,4,3,"As someone who went iPhone to Android, I really didn't want to find all of my music on spotify or any of that so I went ahead and got apple music. It's just as good as it is on iPhone with the exception of a few bugs. The one that really gets me mad is when I open apple music for the day and hit shuffle, the first song that plays starts at 50 seconds in to the song. Overall, the app is decent and provides a good user experience."
17642,Apple Music,A Google user,5,0,I like apple music
17643,Apple Music,Febby R P Syarif,1,1,"I just wanna try the song quality, interface, offline mode before purchase, (hoping better than spotify) but why it is so complicated? just let me hear the song quality even one day full so I can decide who is best. waste my time register a lot of thing then end up still can't play the song. please fix it apple."
17644,Apple Music,Mingyur Tamang,1,2,My money was deducted yesterday when I had already canceled my subscription before. I checked my apple music again but the service was not active in my account. So where did my money go. I cannot contact the cinstomer service also.
17645,Apple Music,Kushan Sachintha,3,2,Kindly give more sorting options in the library. I can't chose to listen to newly downloaded music unless I make a Playlist from iTunes after sort by recent downloads. Now they have this album art issue where some art is partially shown.
17646,Apple Music,Fauzan Aziz,2,1,Ugly UI and SLOW reaction time.
17647,Apple Music,Tanner Boyd,1,1,App won't download music at all. It just sits there at 0% never actually downloading. Spoke to Apple Support and they had no solutions at all that worked. My advice don't get an Apple Music subscription unless you are comfortable with paying for a product that only half works.
17648,Apple Music,Manohar Venkat,1,0,"This app has so many issues, and you can't even tell if they are intentional, given apple's history of slowing down their phones. Was unable to open subscriptions to cancel my membership, which I've been wanting to since weeks. Finally done, uninstalled and never installing again. Relieved."
17649,Apple Music,Jerey Munoz,1,0,Decent when it works. I can't play music if I don't reinstall routinely. It almost never does or is so buggy it's unbearable to navigate and play music. I've gone back and forth from Android/IPhone and each time when I use apple music on android it's a terrible buggy mess on the top flagship phones. (Pixel XL 3 currenty) Basically makes it not worth any price for wasting time and causing frustration. Terrible optimization.
17650,Apple Music,November Rain,1,2,"This app was what's recommended for android users! Couldn't even get a verification code to be sent. So tried a second acct, code was sent, but wouldn't allow me to sign in. Kept saying ""error"" come back later. I just want to download some music, guess I'll take my business elsewhere, cuz this app absolutely sucks! I had to give one star, but it deserves ZERO stars!!"
17651,Apple Music,Leroy Woods IV,2,1,"This app is amazing.......on Apple devices. The android version is filled with bugs. Everything from the app closing, to songs not playing, to songs saying their downloaded, but they're not happens. I believe this is intentional on Apple's part. As a company that pride's themselves on software, I know that this is just Apple trying to get more people to just get an iphone."
17652,Apple Music,Remy Little,1,1,"makes you sign up for a subscription just to listen to music in your library? can't listen to a single song without it asking me if I want the individual, family or college plan on each screen. apple should stick to what it knows best or open up their closed source OS so we can"

17654,Apple Music,Aslan Seven,1,1,WORTHLESS! No headphone jack! I bought a Samsung Galaxy S9+. It's the best quality for my music without the Apple Authorized Repair no headphone jack ripoff. Don't let Apple rip you off. Don't buy an iPhone. No Sim No Sale! No headphone jack no sale!

17656,Apple Music,Blessed Beyond Measure,1,0,"Spotify is waaaaay better. This app is stupid. I canceled my subscription after the 1st, but it won't allow me access even though it already charged me? I can't even access the playlist I established. In that instance Google music is better too. It's like a bad break up or something. Well goodbye to you too. I'm already seeing another app anyway."
17657,Apple Music,Ariana Cristina,2,1,"you find many songs BUT it crashes, it freezes in the middle of playing a song, i keep getting the verify your student account over and over again even tho i did it already and now it wont open it just flashes on and off. Apple...you could do better!"
17658,Apple Music,Andy S,4,1,"The app functions great! The UI is a little different than on iOS, but it is still easy to navigate. It is not optimized for the Google Pixel 3 XL though, so don't expect it to look polished. It hasn't affected functionality, hence why I rated 4 starts instead of 3. Once it is optimized, it could be a 5 start app."

17663,Apple Music,Michael Toner,1,0,worst music playing app on android. i have a mac and thought it would be great to keep things consistent across devices but this app crashes relentlessly for no reason. many times i just can not listen to music for no reason what so ever. i close and open the app many times abd it just fails me again and again. before it was decent but it seems in the past month or so they just broke all functionality. just use spotify or google play
17664,Apple Music,Mario Cilliers,1,1,"Since the last few updates, constant app/song crashing/hanging and bluetooth connection loss is the new norm. Even after they said that this has been fixed. Many other users have same issues. Don't download and use until they have truly fixed it!"
17665,Apple Music,Phoung Vongvatany,1,0,"When I first used this app, I really loved and enjoy using it on my Android phone. But after several months, the app started to close on its own. So then I decided to unsubscribe and delete the app. Then, since it is hard to find the streaming music app, I decided to download it back. This time it disappoint me more than before. I cannot download music. Most of the songs are not available in my country store. If Apple make this app available on Android, why don't they try make it work like IOS."
17666,Apple Music,Richard A,1,1,"This is the worst music app, BY FAR! My advice, deactivate, do a floor to ceiling scrub and try again, because right now the app is unusable and a waste of time."
17667,Apple Music,jonas hingco,4,11,"I am a frequent subscriber of apple music on Android and I commend you for a nice catalog, nice playlists and for the vast offline limit (100,000 songs!) well done üòá The only setback I have regarding your service is that the app doesn't show cover arts for downloaded music.

I had high hopes, that is before actually opening up the app. It took over an hour just to sign in . when it finally worked I go to download my music and it tells me there's an issue and it can't access my library right now. I tried using wifi and Data and uninstalling then reinstalling and it still doesn't work! terrible app don't recommend"
17671,Apple Music,Mariano Banister,1,3,"I have a subscription to this app and has been getting to be just a junk app that doesn't seem to be getting better for me.

Goodbye, Apple, you failed me once more."

17675,Apple Music,A Google user,1,0,"I installed this app as part of a free offer from Verizon. After installing it, Apple requires you to create an account with them, and that involves providing a whole litany of personal information, including your birthday and even your home address (really, what do they need that for???). No thanks, Apple. I'm not your data slave!"

I've had it with my unlimited data plan through Verizon for 6 months and it's worked perfectly fine but like all these other reviews say, it keeps crashing, it deletes all my downloads but they still show up when I check the storage on my phone. seems to be an android/samsung problem. apple please fix. you narcissistic scumbags need to get over yourselves and stop fighting with samsung/android. pay attention to us too not just iphone users. we give you our money too"
17679,Apple Music,A Google user,1,0,"I recently switched from an iPhone 8 to Oppo (financial reasons) and was stoked to see Apple Music available on Android. My happiness was short-lived though. First, I just couldn't play any songs at all, they would just rapidly skip throughout the playlist. Tried just single individual songs, no luck. Sadly, had to delete it and cancel my membership. I say sadly because up and running Apple Music is superior to Spotify by quite a margin, especially sound quality. Oh well, I'll have to join Spotif"
17680,Apple Music,Mohit Mittal,2,1,Not to able to recover my account on new device. Apple has flaws with respect to integration of accounts outside Apple ecosystem. Spent 3 hours on call with support central to resolve my problem but they could not resolve it either. The issue is with the app it does not provide a option to send 2 factor authentication passcode on your registered mobile number. One can only access it with one's old iPhone device with which it was last synced. How foolish and immature of apple on it. This app need modifications on it and also upgradation of skills of their customer care.
17681,Apple Music,Bud Reno,5,0,great app. more than i expected
17682,Apple Music,Michael Jordan,1,1,I dont know why the trillion dollar company who is heavily investing in building so called amazing products amd provides so called apple environment is not focusing on providing a decent support for Music Streaming Mobile Application.

This app does not work with the Note 9. Despite updates it doesn't load playlists or artwork half of the time whether I am on wifi or data. I have to force close it several times and reopen it. When I click a song in a playlist it ""thinks"" for 5 minutes before it plays. I started using Spotify & I have no issues. This app is too buggy for android."

I've been having issues with it for over 1 month now.."
17687,Apple Music,A Google user,1,0,"Disgusting Troublesome App on OnePlus 6T. Now, dont get me wrong - Apple Music is a fantastic service with a beautiful simplified user interface, and it boasts a great library of music. It works really well on iPhone and iPad, and after coming from iOS i thought it would be quite nice to still have it on my android device. I was wrong. I had a bunch of issues signing in, the app would crash and reset and log me out. When i finally got in, i couldnt even make playlists! Dont get this on the 1+."

I uninstalled it and reinstalled it and it just does not work this a shyti app do not download it. I will only be able to listen to my music on my work MAC. This sucks totally.
17690,Apple Music,Siyabonga Nxaba,2,0,As an Android user who has an existing apple account I have had a varied experience in using this app. Downloading songs can be futile at times with only a portion of the song playing and then the player automatically skipping to the next song. I've also had to deal with downloaded songs in my library buffering which is just plain confusing since the music is on my device. Quite a lot of bugs that need to be fixed for the Android version!
17691,Apple Music,Leeann Mythical Moon,2,0,"It's a decent app, it's really convenient and all, but it constantly crashes/""stops working"" (even when i'm not in the app) and whenever i try to play specific songs it freezes.

17695,Apple Music,Kenny Lee,4,0,App no longer crashing unexpectedly. Now when I skips songs etc. App stays running perfectly fine in foreground and background. Needs more speed on the UI. App performance is not excellent but very good B+ performance. Apple Music has a way larger library than the competition. I find many songs on here that's not available on TIDAL or Spotify or Google Music.

It basically just scrolls right on down the list without even trying to play anything that I have requested on my playlist. So it kind of sucks right now because I have never had this issue. I have emailed you guys and no one has responded back concerning my issue. It would be greatly appreciated if I could get some type of help and understanding as to why it is not working.

I have a large array of music I like to listen to, rarely liking ALL the songs on different albums, and this is so nice that we can just add whatever we want from any of them. I personally have no complaints and am so thankful I found this!"
17703,Apple Music,A Google user,1,1,"I really tried to give this app/service a fair trial run. But the loading times are absolutely out of control. Slow as molasses. When an album finally propagates on my screen, it takes way too long to start playing, and often pauses randomly. When I'm connected to my car via Bluetooth, it randomly just stops playing, but doesn't start again at all. Even if I press play reportedly it won't start playing again unless I unlock my screen and open the app. Also, incredibly frustrating that there's no browser player. I subscribed to Apple Music, yet I've been using Spotify free most of the time. Big problems for a paid service. I really tried, but this app/service doesn't measure up to Spotify in any way."
17704,Apple Music,A Google user,2,0,"I was excited to see that Apple Music is available for android users now, but that happiness was quickly shut down by the fact that I've spent countless money on iTunes cards and music only to find out that you cannot even play the music youve purchased in the past on the app even after you've signed in. something for you guys at Apple to think about fixing? the app has been removed from my device, sorry Apple.."

17709,Apple Music,Twink Next Door,2,0,"Very similar to the Apple version of the app. However the Android version is much slower, and buggier than Apple's version of the app. Apple Music works seamlessly on any Apple device and its a shame they can't get their Android app up to par.

I did not log out of the app and all albums are in the library but tells me I need to download again !!!!"
17716,Apple Music,Jordan Hampton,1,0,if you don't have an iPhone I would not recommend this app. there are numerous seemingly intentional bug and glitches in that app that make no sense at all. sometimes music refuses to load and play. other times after a song has finished apple music will no continue to play the next song and will make you open your phone and hit play an additional time when you could be doing something important such as driving. save yourself the trouble and the lost music and just pay for spotify

When you listen to a song on your playlist, which you downloaded, the next song often doesn't play, when your internet connection get's lost. You then have to go to the downloaded music section and continue playing the songs from there.. so all in all, absolutely not user friendly.. What is it with Apple and their apps not working properly on non Apple devices? I mean iTunes on Windows is already a pain. This definitely too is a pain."

The latest 15th November version does not even play any kind of music whatever you do both to the app or phone.

Apple makes it nearly impossible to use iTunes again if you've left your iPhone behind. I tried to sign into my Apple music many times without success. Every page I visit requires a two step authentication, which I only get texts for half the time. Frustrating. They also make you wait nearly a week to recover your Apple ID.

I did it twice and the same thing happened both times."
17739,Apple Music,T B,1,0,"I would give this app a better rating if it wasnt for one of the most infuriating problems that it possesses: the offline / downloaded music feature is an outright lie. I have been using this app for about 7 months now after switching from apple to android and having enjoyed the app while on apple (but still having issues with it, though I will not list them because this is an apple music android review), and I have about 20gb of music downloaded to my phone on the apple music app. I personally dont like to use my data for streaming music, it's one of the ways I save money and budget each month, I'd rather use my data for other things and have compromised by downloading music when I have wifi and playing it using offline mode. But get this, songs will STILL BUFFER when I hit play. Even worse, viewing the downloaded album's song list page somehow requires connection to the cell network, so even when I want to browse my downloaded music, the screen won't load if I'm not connected to a cell network... I can't stand it. At times when I've run out of data, I can no longer listen to music. It instantly ruins my mood, even if I'm happy and pleasant beforehand. Apple, if you see this, FIX THIS ISSUE. I'm not the only one that encounters this, a lot of my friends experience the same issue or similar issues related to the app being so irrationally dependent on connection to a cell network. This issue makes hitting next a stressful endeavor, because I never know if the next song will buffer for 3 minutes instead of instantly playing LIKE A DOWNLOADED SONG SHOULD DO. Time is valuable apple, and when you have time to listen to music and the app that you're PAYING FOR puts up a fight instead of doing what it's intended to do, valuable time is wasted and the pleasure of music is lost."

There was a glitch in the software that wouldn't let me join the family plan; the email that Apple sent me just told me to open the email it sent me. An infuriating scenario. Then I just signed in to my brother's account and was utterly disappointed to find that some of my favourite Japanese and Korean songs, from fairly famous artists in that country, aren't on Apple music (but are on Spotify.)

Amazon music suffers from less but bass boosted there too. I'm on galaxy s8+"

This app would not let me get past some ""start a trial"" thing, and I don't really want to subscribe just to buy a song. The app seems really badly designed, it's very heavy-handed with central control."
17805,Apple Music,Tanmayee Nyayadhish,1,0,"It feels good to have the Apple labeled app on my phone, however the functionality of the app is really poor. It takes time to open the playlist and in the process crashes couple of times. The updates and downloads are really slow and that tests your patience."
17806,Apple Music,Christian Angelo Lozano,4,0,"The app is not so responsive. It is kind of slow, and sometimes I need to tap a button several times to proceed (especially to sign-ups and password inputs). Clearly not optimized. But I will still use this because the music library is good and music is released here first."
17807,Apple Music,Roger John,2,0,"Apple Music (a subscription service) whether via the Android app or iTunes for Windows, DELIVERS TOO LOW A VOLUME LEVEL when streaming and playing downloaded tracks; to the extent that it is essentially a COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY GETTING AND PAYING FOR IT. The whole point of obtaining a cloud-based music library such as Apple Music or its main competitor, the market leader, Spotify, is to listen to digital music in Hi Fidelity. Four that, music MUST be supplied at sufficiently high volume so that it can be HEARD WITHOUT STRAINING. That much is fundamental. Having telephoned Apple Support on a contact number provided via my account page, they were courteous but of no help whatsoever. It's as if APPLE HAVE DISAVOWED ITS OWN SERVICE NAMED AFTER ITSELF. Hence, unless I hear promptly from Apple Music, the developers and whoever else is getting a cut of my money, and something effective is done - I shall terminate my subscription and further publicise just how bad Apple music is."
17808,Apple Music,A Google user,1,0,"Android use is just ridiculous. When I try to login it will not send a verification code to my number and doesn't give me the option ""Didn't get a verification code?"" So it's basically just impossible to login and use my account. Absolutely ridiculous, I'm switching to Spotify."
17809,Apple Music,Joshua Snyder,5,0,Great App I sure do Love Apple iTunes
17810,Apple Music,erica,1,0,It worked good until yesterday. Now its just a white screen. PLEASE FIX my free trial ends in a few days and i was planning on keeping apple music even though i have a galaxy. i will not pay for it if this does not get resolved.
17811,Apple Music,Inioluwa Abimbola,1,1,App keeps crashing. all downloaded songs wiped but they still occupy space on my phone. y'all better fix this trash app. I don't get why I have to pay for this garbage. üòí
17812,Apple Music,A Google user,1,0,"I'm a heavy user of music streaming apps namely Spotify, Google Play Music, and recently Apple Music. I've had so many frustrating moments with Apple Music that compelled me to write a review. The app doesn't sync with iTunes on Mac.. searching for artists, and music is so hard. Too many taps/clicks, there are duplicate artists one with photo and one or more without. You'd think you're missing on some songs if you select the wrong one. Looking for my song history is not a trivial task either and did I mention it doesn't sync between laptop and phone? I can go on and on."
17813,Apple Music,A Google user,2,0,"Bring back the ios 9 queue and album based colour themeing. The new queue is not nearly as functional or smooth and though its just personal preference, the white everywhere is void of personality. Another great feature would be the ability to bring back condensed rows of album names and get rid of that awful, large font found everywhere."
17814,Apple Music,Piyush Nikam,5,0,Osm application... i used my itunes subscriptions in that also
17815,Apple Music,Unnikrishnan Tp,4,3,"This is the best shot for Indians who listen to English. Some not-a-big-deal bugs but I'll keep the subscription just because of the English collection apple music offers. But only until Spotify in India, fingers crossed"
17816,Apple Music,RUN-x-x Kyz,1,0,it's crashing all the time in Samsung s9
17817,Apple Music,Tyrell Solomon,3,1,This app was working perfectly then about two months ago it decided it no longer wanted to download songs. I have it installed on my Google pixel 2 but that shouldn't really be a problem. I've tried clearing cache and storage data and reinstalling but none of that worksüòí
17818,Apple Music,A Google user,1,0,it wouldn't accept my email
17819,Apple Music,Benjamin Wishall,1,1,Can't support a streaming service that still plays R. Kelly music. Remove his music and I'll remove this review and start using the service again. Anyone who doesn't understand why this review is here watch Surviving R. Kelly on lifetime.
17820,Apple Music,Cal Bridgers,1,1,App stalled on installing.
17821,Apple Music,A Google user,3,0,"Over all the app is OK in my experience. Sure, it crashes quite a lot. Sure, the search algorithm is really bad and you can't find what you're looking for if you make only 1 typo. Sure, the download doesn't work most of the time. And sure, the app doesn't allow Chromecast or the Apple streaming thing. The thing is, the music quality is quite good and there are no problems when just listening to music. Conclusion: Could've been worse. I'm moving to YouTube Music now since that's way better"
17822,Apple Music,Victoria Garz,1,0,i have it on my google pixel 3 and i cant even set it up. refuses to send a verification code! when i tried using an old apple ID from an old phone it signed it and i tried addding songs and i couldnt play them. it skipped through every song until it reached one of my old songs that i bought. very frustrating.
17823,Apple Music,Ashish Ash,1,0,Its not worth anymore. I have been using apple music for 2 years and it makes me frustrated evertime i try to download a song. It takes forever to download. And when I shuffle songs it only plays few song on repeat and skips many of my favorite songs even if i play it whole day.
17824,Apple Music,Scott Weaver,1,1,I was expecting to be able to use this app to play music on my sd card. Which of course is not the case. It's a shame I like the iphone music player better than google music.
17825,Apple Music,Thanos Sot,1,1,The app needs improvements
17826,Apple Music,8 Bit Coffee,5,0,Just awesome nothing more to say
17827,Apple Music,Stef Kunzer,1,0,"Can't seem to get access to my own itunes library without subscribing to an expensive service. Spotify is far better as a music service, but I'm mystified why you can't even access your own existing music library. Even Google play music lets you do that."
17828,Apple Music,Winston Trim,1,0,"App deserves 3 stars but I give it 4 just for having access to Apple Music on an Android. Biggest and most recent complaint is playlists can no longer be played in order, everything is permanently on shuffle. Have done the usual troubleshooting and the only option left is to reinstall and have to redownload my library. *(Edit) Removed the app to try and solve my issue, now I cant get Apple Music to install at all! Tried other apps and they work fine... App wont to install, 1 star until support!"
17829,Apple Music,Elis,1,0,I dont understand why this cant work exactly like itunes on iPhone. Big let down coming from itunes on iphone to this. Looks the same but its buggy. Songs wont load or show up that I've downloaded. Have to regularly click in and out of albums to make songs appear that I own and have downloaded. On iphone if you select shuffle or repeat it stays on until you turn it off but on android every single time you use the app you have to turn it on
17830,Apple Music,A Google user,1,0,"This was (initially) a great app, but for some unknown reason, the app won't load, and I am stuck with an all white screen. Uninstalling and reinstalling does not work, as the white screen is there. Please fix."
17831,Apple Music,Jacob Allenwood,3,0,"Biggest pain point is when music that I have DOWNLOADED will not play offline at all, and will sometimes even show an error message. Sometimes I have to try and retry/play/pause a song for like 2 minutes straight before it will load and play. Very frustrating UX."
17832,Apple Music,Abhishek Taware,1,1,Really a sad app apple kepps on degrading yoy after steve. I wish he was there to kick these stupid useless and lazy peoples ass and get some work done. Ios and apple music is their last resort and i see yhem doing their best to screw it up. Uninstalling it for good as it is completely crashab
17833,Apple Music,Joshua Davis,2,0,I'm not sure who Apple's target audience is with this. Station building is not as good as you get with other services. It's seems to be confuses by some genres and bands throwing unrelated artists into a mix. It's a little clunky on my note 8 and constantly logs me out.
17834,Apple Music,Megan R.,1,0,cancelling subscription Very disappointed as I pay for a subscription and I'm unable to listen to music as the app will not work on my phone. I have an android and have had no problems with the application until within the last month and now the application won't even open. Hope they fix it soon
17835,Apple Music,Aditya Sharma,1,0,songs don't download since updated into pie os
17836,Apple Music,Tammy Allison,1,0,"I just got passed the 3 month trial and it has been an excellent app, until yesterday, I noticed whenever I open the app it just shows a white screen and they just deducted my monthly fee. I'm just pissed spotify isn't available in my country ü§®"
17837,Apple Music,dournaga _,1,2,"This app is full of bugs. Lost my Playlist several times. All of the best songs, I've to download again and again. You can't imagine how disappointed i am."
17838,Apple Music,Duane Meyer,2,0,Expected I would be able to access songs I already own on the Apple platform. Nope. Just another streaming service. I could pay a monthly fee to access my own songs but that's suboptimal. Guess I'll have to keep the old iPod alive a little longer.
17839,Apple Music,Alexander Orton,1,0,"Installed, got free trial, playlists automatically synced from iTunes on pc to Apple music app on phone. But: ""Song not available in your region or country"". Love iTunes on pc or iPhone but as usual, apple is terrible at working with anything else. Don't bother if you're running android."
17840,Apple Music,eyal karpel,3,0,"The good: Nice app, lots of music, can build custom plsylist, can like or dislike songs The bad: 1.lots of songs are missing 2. The personal songs recommendation sucks. It keep suggesting me mediterranean/Arab style Hebrew songs although I hate this genre. 3. No voice recognition like in YouTube. It is very difficult to play songs when driving 4. Please add automatic songs play/suggestions after song is over like Spotify /YouTube has. When doing sport and the playlist is done I don't like to take my phone out. 5. Google voice recognition dosnt interface well with the app"
17841,Apple Music,Paul Rybarczyk,1,0,cannot log in...over and over again
17842,Apple Music,Basher Ramram,5,3,I love the set up and ease of use. I also love that there's no ads and it doesn't always ask you to upgrade. They also have almost every song you can think of (except for some obsolete mixtapes).

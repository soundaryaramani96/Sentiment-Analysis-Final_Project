Project Classification: Type II

Summary: 
Listening to music can affect people emotions. They can experience simultaneous feelings, such as happiness and hope, or sadness and angry, when a song is being played. However, inferring emotions that can be caused by a musical fragment is a complex task. To deduce relationships between feelings and music, we propose a sentiment analysis method based on data mining. In particular, different musical features are extracted and classified to analyze the influence of some music parameters on human emotions.

Hypothesis: 
1. Amazon music's low cost structure packaged with amazon prime membership would make it a popular app gaining higher public attention as compared to Pandora and Spotify. 
2. Pandora's free version gains more attention in the market within a certain age range although its advertisements can act as interruptions. 
3. Spotify's immense music playlist collection and diverse genres  with a very low subscription rate has gained competitive edge in the music industry.  

Results:
After running the code, we found that Pandora offers great and diverse music choices. This rejects our hypothesis as Pandora's immense music playlist collection and diverse genres with a very low subscription rate has gained competitive edge in the music industry.
Based on the cost factor, Amazon music and Pandora being free makes them popular gaining high attention in the market.
Pandora's free version gains more attention, but after analysing it on Advertisement scale, it offers a lot of interruptions which also proves our hypothesis true.
